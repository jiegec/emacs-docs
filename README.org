#+TITLE: emacs-docs

* Introduction
This repo is for mobile e-book readers. However, the pdf version of these documents are not so friendly as mobi files. So I use `ebook-convert' from calibre to convert these documents to mobi.

The files are generated from the git repo of Emacs. I may update them sometimes. You can make a issue to ask me for more documents or ask me to update.

Note: The Org Manual includes links to GNU Emacs Calc Manual, so that file contains both manuals. Not sure what would be better.
