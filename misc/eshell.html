<h2 class="unnumbered">Eshell</h2>

<p>Eshell is a shell-like command interpreter implemented in Emacs Lisp. 
It invokes no external processes except for those requested by the
user.  It is intended to be an alternative to the IELM (see <a href="emacs.html#Lisp-Interaction">Emacs Lisp Interaction</a>)
REPL for Emacs <em>and</em> with an interface similar to command shells
such as <samp><span class="command">bash</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">zsh</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">rc</span></samp>, or
<samp><span class="command">4dos</span></samp>. 
<!-- This manual is updated to release 2.4 of Eshell. -->

<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction</h2>

<h3 class="section">1.1 What is Eshell?</h3>

<p><a name="index-what-is-Eshell_003f-1"></a><a name="index-Eshell_002c-what-it-is-2"></a>
Eshell is a <dfn>command shell</dfn> written in Emacs Lisp.  Everything it
does, it uses Emacs's facilities to do.  This means that Eshell is as
portable as Emacs itself.  It also means that cooperation with Lisp code
is natural and seamless.

   </p>
<p>What is a command shell?  To properly understand the role of a shell,
it's necessary to visualize what a computer does for you.  Basically, a
computer is a tool; in order to use that tool, you must tell it what to
do—or give it “commands.”  These commands take many forms, such as
clicking with a mouse on certain parts of the screen.  But that is only
one form of command input.

   </p>
<p>By far the most versatile way to express what you want the computer to
do is by using an abbreviated language called <dfn>script</dfn>.  In
script, instead of telling the computer, “list my files, please”,
one writes a standard abbreviated command word—`<samp><span class="samp">ls</span></samp>'.  Typing
`<samp><span class="samp">ls</span></samp>' in a command shell is a script way of telling the computer
to list your files.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>

   </p>
<p>The real flexibility of this approach is apparent only when you realize
that there are many, many different ways to list files.  Perhaps you
want them sorted by name, sorted by date, in reverse order, or grouped
by type.  Most graphical browsers have simple ways to express this.  But
what about showing only a few files, or only files that meet a certain
criteria?  In very complex and specific situations, the request becomes
too difficult to express using a mouse or pointing device.  It is just
these kinds of requests that are easily solved using a command shell.

   </p>
<p>For example, what if you want to list every Word file on your hard
drive, larger than 100 kilobytes in size, and which hasn't been looked
at in over six months?  That is a good candidate list for deletion, when
you go to clean up your hard drive.  But have you ever tried asking your
computer for such a list?  There is no way to do it!  At least, not
without using a command shell.

   </p>
<p>The role of a command shell is to give you more control over what your
computer does for you.  Not everyone needs this amount of control, and
it does come at a cost: Learning the necessary script commands to
express what you want done.  A complicated query, such as the example
above, takes time to learn.  But if you find yourself using your
computer frequently enough, it is more than worthwhile in the long run. 
Any tool you use often deserves the time spent learning to master it. 
<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a>

</p>
<h3 class="section">1.2 What Eshell is not</h3>

<p><a name="index-Eshell_002c-what-it-is-not-3"></a><a name="index-what-Eshell-is-not-4"></a><a name="index-what-isn_0027t-Eshell_003f-5"></a>
Eshell is <em>not</em> a replacement for system shells such as
<samp><span class="command">bash</span></samp> or <samp><span class="command">zsh</span></samp>.  Use Eshell when you want to move
text between Emacs and external processes; if you only want to pipe
output from one external process to another (and then another, and so
on), use a system shell, because Emacs's IO system is buffer oriented,
not stream oriented, and is very inefficient at such tasks.  If you
want to write shell scripts in Eshell, don't; either write an elisp
library or use a system shell.

   </p>
<p>Some things Eshell just doesn't do well.  It fills the niche between
IELM and your system shell, where the peculiar use-cases lie, and it
is less than ideal outside that niche.

<h3 class="section">1.3 Contributors to Eshell</h3>

<p><a name="index-contributors-6"></a><a name="index-authors-7"></a>
Contributions to Eshell are welcome.  I have limited time to work on
this project, but I will gladly add any code you contribute to me to
this package.

   </p>
<p>The following persons have made contributions to Eshell.

     </p>
<ul>
<li>Eli Zaretskii made it possible for Eshell to run without requiring
asynchronous subprocess support.  This is important for MS-DOS, which
does not have such support.

     </li>
<li>Miles Bader contributed many fixes during the port to Emacs 21.

     </li>
<li>Stefan Monnier fixed the things which bothered him, which of course made
things better for all.

     </li>
<li>Gerd Moellmann also helped to contribute bug fixes during the initial
integration with Emacs 21.

     </li>
<li>Alex Schroeder contributed code for interactively querying the user
before overwriting files.

     </li>
<li>Sudish Joseph helped with some XEmacs compatibility issues. 
</li>
</ul>

   <p>Apart from these, a lot of people have sent suggestions, ideas,
requests, bug reports and encouragement.  Thanks a lot!  Without you
there would be no new releases of Eshell.

<h2 class="chapter">2 Commands</h2>

<p>In a command shell, everything is done by invoking commands.  This
chapter covers command invocations in Eshell, including the command
history and invoking commands in a script file.

</li>
</ul>

<pagebreak></pagebreak><div class="node"><a name="Invocation"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">2.1 Invocation</h3>

<p>Unlike regular system shells, Eshell never invokes kernel functions
directly, such as <code>exec(3)</code>.  Instead, it uses the Lisp functions
available in the Emacs Lisp library.  It does this by transforming the
input line into a callable Lisp form.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-3" name="fnd-3"><sup>3</sup></a>

   </p>
<p>The command can be either an Elisp function or an external command. 
Eshell looks first for an <a href="#Aliases">alias</a> with the same name as the
command, then a <a href="#Built_002dins">built-in command</a> or a function with the
same name; if there is no match, it then tries to execute it as an
external command.

   </p>
<p>The semicolon (<code>;</code>) can be used to separate multiple command
invocations on a single line.  A command invocation followed by an
ampersand (<code>&amp;</code>) will be run in the background.  Eshell has no job
control, so you can not suspend or background the current process, or
bring a background process into the foreground.  That said, background
processes invoked from Eshell can be controlled the same way as any
other background process in Emacs.

</p>
<pagebreak></pagebreak><div class="node"><a name="Arguments"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">2.2 Arguments</h3>

<p>Command arguments are passed to the functions as either strings or
numbers, depending on what the parser thinks they look like.  If you
need to use a function that takes some other data type, you will need to
call it in an Elisp expression (which can also be used with
<a href="#Expansion">expansions</a>).  As with other shells, you can
escape special characters and spaces with the backslash (<code>\</code>) and
apostrophes (<code>''</code>) and double quotes (<code>""</code>).  This is needed
especially for file names with special characters like pipe
(<code>|</code>), which could be part of remote file names.

</p>
<pagebreak></pagebreak><div class="node">
<a name="Built-ins"></a><a name="Built_002dins"></a>
</div>

<h3 class="section">2.3 Built-in commands</h3>

<p>Several commands are built-in in Eshell.  In order to call the
external variant of a built-in command <code>foo</code>, you could call
<code>*foo</code>.  Usually, this should not be necessary.  You can check
what will be applied by the <code>which</code> command:

</p>
<pre class="example">     ~ $ which ls
     eshell/ls is a compiled Lisp function in `em-ls.el'
     ~ $ which *ls
     /bin/ls
</pre>
   <p>If you want to discard a given built-in command, you could declare an
alias, <a href="#Aliases">Aliases</a>.  Example:

</p>
<pre class="example">     ~ $ which sudo
     eshell/sudo is a compiled Lisp function in `em-unix.el'
     ~ $ alias sudo '*sudo $*'
     ~ $ which sudo
     sudo is an alias, defined as "*sudo $*"
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-eshell_002dprefer_002dlisp_002dfunctions-8"></a>If you would prefer to use the built-in commands instead of the external
commands, set <code>eshell-prefer-lisp-functions</code> to <code>t</code>.

   </p>
<p>Some of the built-in commands have different behavior from their
external counterparts, and some have no external counterpart.  Most of
these will print a usage message when given the <code>--help</code> option.

     </p>
<dl>
<dt><code>addpath</code></dt>
<dd>
<a name="index-addpath-9"></a>Adds a given path or set of paths to the PATH environment variable, or,
with no arguments, prints the current paths in this variable.

<dd>
<a name="index-cd-28"></a>This command changes the current working directory.  Usually, it is
invoked as `<samp><span class="samp">cd foo</span></samp>' where <samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp> is the new working directory. 
But <samp><span class="command">cd</span></samp> knows about a few special arguments:

     <p>When it receives no argument at all, it changes to the home directory.

     </p>
<p>Giving the command `<samp><span class="samp">cd -</span></samp>' changes back to the previous working
directory (this is the same as `<samp><span class="samp">cd $-</span></samp>').

     </p>
<p>The command `<samp><span class="samp">cd =</span></samp>' shows the directory stack.  Each line is
numbered.

     </p>
<p>With `<samp><span class="samp">cd =foo</span></samp>', Eshell searches the directory stack for a directory
matching the regular expression `<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>' and changes to that
directory.

     </p>
<p>With `<samp><span class="samp">cd -42</span></samp>', you can access the directory stack by number.

</dl>

<h4 class="subsection">2.3.1 Built-in variables</h4>

<p>Eshell knows a few built-in variables:

     </p>
<dl>
<dt><code>$+</code></dt>
<dd>
<a name="index-g_t_0024_002b-31"></a>This variable always contains the current working directory.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>$-</code></dt>
<dd>
<a name="index-g_t_0024_002d-32"></a>This variable always contains the previous working directory (the
current working directory from before the last <code>cd</code> command).

     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>$_</code></dt>
<dd>
<a name="index-g_t_0024_005f-33"></a>It refers to the last argument of the last command.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>$$</code></dt>
<dd>
<a name="index-g_t_0024_0024-34"></a>This is the result of the last command.  In case of an external
command, it is <code>t</code> or <code>nil</code>.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>$?</code></dt>
<dd>
<a name="index-g_t_0024_003f-35"></a>This variable contains the exit code of the last command (0 or 1 for
Lisp functions, based on successful completion).

   </dd>
</dl>

<pagebreak></pagebreak><div class="node"><a name="Variables"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">2.4 Variables</h3>

<p>Since Eshell is just an Emacs REPL<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-4" name="fnd-4"><sup>4</sup></a>, it
does not have its own scope, and simply stores variables the same you
would in an Elisp program.  Eshell provides a command version of
<code>setq</code> for convenience.

</p>
<pagebreak></pagebreak><div class="node"><a name="Aliases"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">2.5 Aliases</h3>

<p>Aliases are commands that expand to a longer input line.  For example,
<samp><span class="command">ll</span></samp> is a common alias for <code>ls -l</code>, and would be defined
with the command invocation `<samp><span class="samp">alias ll ls -l</span></samp>'; with this defined,
running `<samp><span class="samp">ll foo</span></samp>' in Eshell will actually run `<samp><span class="samp">ls -l foo</span></samp>'. 
Aliases defined (or deleted) by the <samp><span class="command">alias</span></samp> command are
automatically written to the file named by <code>eshell-aliases-file</code>,
which you can also edit directly (although you will have to manually
reload it).

</p>
<pagebreak></pagebreak><div class="node"><a name="History"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">2.6 History</h3>

<p><a name="index-history-36"></a>The `<samp><span class="samp">history</span></samp>' command shows all commands kept in the history ring
as numbered list.  If the history ring contains
<code>eshell-history-size</code> commands, those numbers change after every
command invocation, therefore the `<samp><span class="samp">history</span></samp>' command shall be
applied before using the expansion mechanism with history numbers.

   </p>
<p>The n-th entry of the history ring can be applied with the `<samp><span class="samp">!n</span></samp>'
command.  If <code>n</code> is negative, the entry is counted from the end
of the history ring.

   </p>
<p>`<samp><span class="samp">!foo</span></samp>' expands to the last command beginning with <code>foo</code>, and
`<samp><span class="samp">!?foo</span></samp>' to the last command containing <code>foo</code>.  The n-th
argument of the last command beginning with <code>foo</code> is accessible
by <code>!foo:n</code>.

   </p>
<p>The history ring is loaded from a file at the start of every session,
and written back to the file at the end of every session.  The file path
is specified in <code>eshell-history-file-name</code>.  Unlike other shells,
such as Bash, Eshell can not be configured to keep a history ring of a
different size than that of the history file.

   </p>
<p>Since the default buffer navigation and searching key-bindings are
still present in the Eshell buffer, the commands for history
navigation and searching are bound to different keys:

     </p>
<dl>
<dt>
<kbd>M-r</kbd><dt><kbd>M-s</kbd></dt>
</dt>
<dd>History I-search.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>
<kbd>M-p</kbd><dt><kbd>M-n</kbd></dt>
</dt>
<dd>Previous and next history line.  If there is anything on the input
line when you run these commands, they will instead jump to the
precious or next line that begins with that string. 
</dd>
</dl>

<pagebreak></pagebreak><div class="node"><a name="Completion"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">2.7 Completion</h3>

<p>Eshell uses the pcomplete package for programmable completion, similar
to that of other command shells.  Argument completion differs depending
on the preceding command: for example, possible completions for
<samp><span class="command">rmdir</span></samp> are only directories, while <samp><span class="command">rm</span></samp> completions can
be directories <em>and</em> files.  Eshell provides predefined completions
for the built-in functions and some common external commands, and you
can define your own for any command.

   </p>
<p>Eshell completion also works for lisp forms and glob patterns. If the
point is on a lisp form, then &lt;TAB&gt; will behave similarly to completion
in <code>elisp-mode</code> and <code>lisp-interaction-mode</code>.  For glob
patterns, If there are few enough possible completions of the patterns,
they will be cycled when &lt;TAB&gt; is pressed, otherwise it will be removed
from the input line and the possible completions will be listed.

   </p>
<p>If you want to see the entire list of possible completions when it's
below the cycling threshold, press <kbd>M-?</kbd>.

</p>
<h4 class="subsection">2.7.1 pcomplete</h4>

<p>Pcomplete, short for programmable completion, is the completion
library originally written for Eshell, but usable for command
completion<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-5" name="fnd-5"><sup>5</sup></a>  in other modes.

   </p>
<p>Completions are defined as functions (with <code>defun</code>) named
<code>pcomplete/COMMAND</code>, where <code>COMMAND</code> is the name of the
command for which this function provides completions; you can also name
the function <code>pcomplete/MAJOR-MODE/COMMAND</code> to define completions
for a specific major mode.

</p>
<pagebreak></pagebreak><div class="node"><a name="for-loop"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">2.8 <code>for</code> loop</h3>

<p>Because Eshell commands can not (easily) be combined with lisp forms,
Eshell provides a command-oriented <samp><span class="command">for</span></samp>-loop for convenience. 
The syntax is as follows:

</p>
<pre class="example">     <code>for VAR in TOKENS { command invocation(s) }</code>
</pre>
   <p>where `<samp><span class="samp">TOKENS</span></samp>' is a space-separated sequence of values of
<var>VAR</var> for each iteration.  This can even be the output of a
command if `<samp><span class="samp">TOKENS</span></samp>' is replaced with `<samp><span class="samp">{ command invocation }</span></samp>'.

</p>
<pagebreak></pagebreak><div class="node"><a name="Scripts"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">2.9 Scripts</h3>

<p><a name="index-source-37"></a><a name="index-eshell_002dsource_002dfile-38"></a>You can run Eshell scripts much like scripts for other shells; the main
difference is that since Eshell is not a system command, you have to run
it from within Emacs.  An Eshell script is simply a file containing a
sequence of commands, as with almost any other shell script.  Scripts
are invoked from Eshell with <samp><span class="command">source</span></samp>, or from anywhere in Emacs
with <code>eshell-source-file</code>.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-g_t_002e-39"></a>If you wish to load a script into your <em>current</em> environment,
rather than in a subshell, use the <code>.</code> command.

</p>
<pagebreak></pagebreak><div class="node"><a name="Expansion"></a></div>

<h2 class="chapter">3 Expansion</h2>

<p>Expansion in a command shell is somewhat like macro expansion in macro
parsers (such as <samp><span class="command">cpp</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">m4</span></samp>), but in a command
shell, they are less often used for constants, and usually for using
variables and string manipulation.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-6" name="fnd-6"><sup>6</sup></a>  For example, <code>$var</code> on a line
expands to the value of the variable <code>var</code> when the line is
executed.  Expansions are usually passed as arguments, but may also be
used as commands.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-7" name="fnd-7"><sup>7</sup></a>

<h3 class="section">3.1 Dollars Expansion</h3>

<p>Eshell has different <code>$</code> expansion syntax from other shells.  There
are some similarities, but don't let these lull you into a false sense
of familiarity.

     </p>
<dl>
<dt><code>$var</code></dt>
<dd>Expands to the value bound to <code>var</code>.  This is the main way to use
variables in command invocations.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>$#var</code></dt>
<dd>Expands to the length of the value bound to <code>var</code>.  Raises an error
if the value is not a sequence
(see <a href="elisp.html#Sequences-Arrays-Vectors">Sequences</a>).

     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>$(lisp)</code></dt>
<dd>Expands to the result of evaluating the S-expression <code>(lisp)</code>.  On
its own, this is identical to just <code>(lisp)</code>, but with the <code>$</code>,
it can be used in a string, such as `<samp><span class="samp">/some/path/$(lisp).txt</span></samp>'.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>${command}</code></dt>
<dd>Returns the output of <samp><span class="command">command</span></samp>, which can be any valid Eshell
command invocation, and may even contain expansions.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>$var[i]</code></dt>
<dd>Expands to the <code>i</code>th element of the value bound to <code>var</code>.  If
the value is a string, it will be split at whitespace to make it a list. 
Again, raises an error if the value is not a sequence.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>$var[: i]</code></dt>
<dd>As above, but now splitting occurs at the colon character.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>$var[: i j]</code></dt>
<dd>As above, but instead of returning just a string, it now returns a list
of two strings.  If the result is being interpolated into a larger
string, this list will be flattened into one big string, with each
element separated by a space.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>$var["\\\\" i]</code></dt>
<dd>Separate on backslash characters.  Actually, the first argument – if it
doesn't have the form of a number, or a plain variable name – can be
any regular expression.  So to split on numbers, use `<samp><span class="samp">$var["[0-9]+" 10 20]</span></samp>'.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>$var[hello]</code></dt>
<dd>Calls <code>assoc</code> on <code>var</code> with <code>"hello"</code>, expecting it to be
an alist (see <a href="elisp.html#Association-List-Type">Association Lists</a>).

     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>$#var[hello]</code></dt>
<dd>Returns the length of the cdr of the element of <code>var</code> who car is equal

<pagebreak></pagebreak><div class="node"><a name="Globbing"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">3.2 Globbing</h3>

<p>Eshell's globbing syntax is very similar to that of Zsh.  Users coming
from Bash can still use Bash-style globbing, as there are no
incompatibilities.  Most globbing is pattern-based expansion, but there
is also predicate-based expansion.  See
<a href="zsh.html#Filename-Generation">Filename Generation</a>
for full syntax.  To customize the syntax and behavior of globbing in
Eshell see the Customize<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-8" name="fnd-8"><sup>8</sup></a>
groups “eshell-glob” and “eshell-pred”.

</p>
<pagebreak></pagebreak><div class="node">
<a name="Input%2fOutput"></a><a name="Input_002fOutput"></a>
</div>

<h2 class="chapter">4 Input/Output</h2>

<p>Since Eshell does not communicate with a terminal like most command
shells, IO is a little different.

</p>
<h3 class="section">4.1 Visual Commands</h3>

<p>If you try to run programs from within Eshell that are not
line-oriented, such as programs that use ncurses, you will just get
garbage output, since the Eshell buffer is not a terminal emulator. 
Eshell solves this problem by running such programs in Emacs's
terminal emulator.

   </p>
<p>Programs that need a terminal to display output properly are referred
to in this manual as “visual commands,” because they are not simply
line-oriented.  You must tell Eshell which commands are visual, by
adding them to <code>eshell-visual-commands</code>; for commands that are
visual for only certain <em>sub</em>-commands – e.g., `<samp><span class="samp">git log</span></samp>' but
not `<samp><span class="samp">git status</span></samp>' – use <code>eshell-visual-subcommands</code>; and for
commands that are visual only when passed certain options, use
<code>eshell-visual-options</code>.

   </p>
<p>Caution: Some tools such as Git use the pager `<samp><span class="samp">less</span></samp>' by default
to paginate their output but call it with its `<samp><span class="samp">-F</span></samp>' option.  This
option causes `<samp><span class="samp">less</span></samp>' to echo the output instead of paginating it
if the output is less than one page long.  This causes undesirable
behavior if, e.g., `<samp><span class="samp">git diff</span></samp>', is defined as a visual subcommand. 
It'll work if the output is big enough and fail if it is less than one
page long.  If that occurs to you, search for configuration options
for calling `<samp><span class="samp">less</span></samp>' without the `<samp><span class="samp">-F</span></samp>' option.  For Git, you
can do that using `<samp><span class="samp">git config --global core.pager 'less -+F'</span></samp>'.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-eshell_002ddestroy_002dbuffer_002dwhen_002dprocess_002ddies-40"></a>If you want the buffers created by visual programs killed when the
program exits, customize the variable
<code>eshell-destroy-buffer-when-process-dies</code> to a non-<code>nil</code>
value; the default is <code>nil</code>.

</p>
<h3 class="section">4.2 Redirection</h3>

<p>Redirection is mostly the same in Eshell as it is in other command
shells.  The output redirection operators <code>&gt;</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;</code> as
well as pipes are supported, but there is not yet any support for
input redirection.  Output can also be redirected to buffers, using
the <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> redirection operator, and Elisp functions, using
virtual devices.

   </p>
<p>The buffer redirection operator, <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>, expects a buffer object
on the right-hand side, into which it inserts the output of the
left-hand side.  e.g., `<samp><span class="samp">echo hello &gt;&gt;&gt; #&lt;buffer *scratch*&gt;</span></samp>'
inserts the string <code>"hello"</code> into the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer. 
The convenience shorthand variant `<samp><span class="samp">#&lt;</span><var>buffer-name</var><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>', as in
`<samp><span class="samp">#&lt;*scratch*&gt;</span></samp>', is also accepted.

   </p>
<p><code>eshell-virtual-targets</code> is a list of mappings of virtual device
names to functions.  Eshell comes with two virtual devices:
<samp><span class="file">/dev/kill</span></samp>, which sends the text to the kill ring, and
<samp><span class="file">/dev/clip</span></samp>, which sends text to the clipboard.

   </p>
<p>You can, of course, define your own virtual targets.  They are defined
by adding a list of the form `<samp><span class="samp">("/dev/name" </span><var>function</var> <var>mode</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>' to
<code>eshell-virtual-targets</code>.  The first element is the device name;
<var>function</var> may be either a lambda or a function name.  If
<var>mode</var> is <code>nil</code>, then the function is the output function; if it is
non-<code>nil</code>, then the function is passed the redirection mode as a
symbol–<code>overwrite</code> for <code>&gt;</code>, <code>append</code> for <code>&gt;&gt;</code>, or
<code>insert</code> for <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>–and the function is expected to return
the output function.

   </p>
<p>The output function is called once on each line of output until
<code>nil</code> is passed, indicating end of output.

<h2 class="chapter">5 Extension modules</h2>

<p>Eshell provides a facility for defining extension modules so that they
can be disabled and enabled without having to unload and reload them,
and to provide a common parent Customize group for the
modules.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-9" name="fnd-9"><sup>9</sup></a>  An Eshell
module is defined the same as any other library but one requirement: the
module must define a Customize<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-10" name="fnd-10"><sup>10</sup></a>
group using <code>eshell-defgroup</code> (in place of <code>defgroup</code>) with
<code>eshell-module</code> as the parent group.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-11" name="fnd-11"><sup>11</sup></a>  You also need to load the following as shown:

   </p>
<p>Below is a list of some known problems with Eshell version 2.4.2,
which is the version included with Emacs 22.

     </p>
<dl>
<dt>Documentation incomplete
<br><dt>Differentiate between aliases and functions</dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Allow for a Bash-compatible syntax, such as:

     <pre class="example">          alias arg=blah
          function arg () { blah $* }
     </pre>
     <br>
</dd>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">for i in 1 2 3 { grep -q a b &amp;&amp; *echo has it } | wc -l</span></samp>' outputs result after prompt</dt>
<dd>
In fact, piping to a process from a looping construct doesn't work in
general.  If I change the call to <code>eshell-copy-handles</code> in
<code>eshell-rewrite-for-command</code> to use <code>eshell-protect</code>, it seems
to work, but the output occurs after the prompt is displayed.  The whole
structured command thing is too complicated at present.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Error with <samp><span class="command">bc</span></samp> in <code>eshell-test</code>
</dt>
<dd>
On some XEmacs system, the subprocess interaction test fails
inexplicably, although <samp><span class="command">bc</span></samp> works fine at the command prompt.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Eshell does not delete <samp><span class="file">*Help*</span></samp> buffers in XEmacs 21.1.8+</dt>
<dd>
In XEmacs 21.1.8, the <samp><span class="file">*Help*</span></samp> buffer has been renamed such that
multiple instances of the <samp><span class="file">*Help*</span></samp> buffer can exist.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Pcomplete sometimes gets stuck</dt>
<dd>
You press &lt;TAB&gt;, but no completions appear, even though the
directory has matching files.  This behavior is rare.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">grep python $&lt;rpm -qa&gt;</span></samp>' doesn't work, but using `<samp><span class="samp">*grep</span></samp>' does</dt>
<dd>
This happens because the <code>grep</code> Lisp function returns immediately,
and then the asynchronous <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp> process expects to examine the
temporary file, which has since been deleted.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Problem with C-r repeating text</dt>
<dd>
If the text <em>before point</em> reads "./run", and you type <kbd>C-r r u
n</kbd>, it will repeat the line for every character typed.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Backspace doesn't scroll back after continuing (in smart mode)</dt>
<dd>
Hitting space during a process invocation, such as <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp>, will
cause it to track the bottom of the output; but backspace no longer
scrolls back.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>It's not possible to fully <code>unload-feature</code> Eshell
<br><dt>Menu support was removed, but never put back
<br><dt>Using C-p and C-n with rebind gets into a locked state</dt>
</dt>
</dt>
<dd>
This happened a few times in Emacs 21, but has been irreproducible
since.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>If an interactive process is currently running, <kbd>M-!</kbd> doesn't work
<br><dt>Use a timer instead of <code>sleep-for</code> when killing child processes
<br><dt>Piping to a Lisp function is not supported</dt>
</dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Make it so that the Lisp command on the right of the pipe is repeatedly
called with the input strings as arguments.  This will require changing
<code>eshell-do-pipeline</code> to handle non-process targets.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Input redirection is not supported</dt>
<dd>
See the above entry.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Problem running <samp><span class="command">less</span></samp> without arguments on Windows</dt>
<dd>
The result in the Eshell buffer is:

     <pre class="example">          Spawning child process: invalid argument
     </pre>
     <p>Also a new <samp><span class="command">less</span></samp> buffer was created with nothing in it<small class="dots">...</small>
(presumably this holds the output of <samp><span class="command">less</span></samp>).

     </p>
<p>If <samp><span class="command">less.exe</span></samp> is invoked from the Eshell command line, the
expected output is written to the buffer.

     </p>
<p>Note that this happens on NT-Emacs 20.6.1 on Windows 2000. The term.el
package and the supplied shell both use the <samp><span class="command">cmdproxy</span></samp> program
for running shells.

     <br></p>
</dd>
<dt>Implement `<samp><span class="samp">-r</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">-n</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">-s</span></samp>' switches for <samp><span class="command">cp</span></samp>
<br><dt>Make <kbd>M-5 M-x eshell</kbd> switch to “*eshell&lt;5&gt;*”, creating if need be
<br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">mv </span><var>dir</var> <var>file</var><span class="samp">.tar</span></samp>' does not remove directories</dt>
</dt>
</dt>
<dd>
This is because the tar option –remove-files doesn't do so.  Should it
be Eshell's job?

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Bind <code>standard-output</code> and <code>standard-error</code>
</dt>
<dd>
This would be so that if a Lisp function calls <code>print</code>, everything
will happen as it should (albeit slowly).

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>When an extension module fails to load, `<samp><span class="samp">cd /</span></samp>' gives a Lisp error
<br><dt>If a globbing pattern returns one match, should it be a list?
<br><dt>Make sure syntax table is correct in Eshell mode</dt>
</dt>
</dt>
<dd>
So that <kbd>M-DEL</kbd> acts in a predictable manner, etc.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Allow all Eshell buffers to share the same history and list-dir
<br><dt>There is a problem with script commands that output to <samp><span class="file">/dev/null</span></samp>
</dt>
</dt>
<dd>
If a script file, somewhere in the middle, uses `<samp><span class="samp">&gt; /dev/null</span></samp>',
output from all subsequent commands is swallowed.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Split up parsing of text after `<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>' in <samp><span class="file">esh-var.el</span></samp>
</dt>
<dd>
Make it similar to the way that <samp><span class="file">esh-arg.el</span></samp> is structured. 
Then add parsing of `<samp><span class="samp">$[?\n]</span></samp>'.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>After pressing <kbd>M-RET</kbd>, redisplay before running the next command
<br><dt>Argument predicates and modifiers should work anywhere in a path</dt>

          Invalid regexp: "Unmatched ( or \\("
     </pre>
     <p>With <samp><span class="command">zsh</span></samp>, the glob above expands to all files named
<samp><span class="file">Root</span></samp> in directories named <samp><span class="file">CVS</span></samp>.

     <br></p>
</dd>
<dt>Typing `<samp><span class="samp">echo ${locate locate}/bin&lt;TAB&gt;</span></samp>' results in a Lisp error</dt>
<dd>
Perhaps it should interpolate all permutations, and make that the
globbing result, since otherwise hitting return here will result in
“(list of filenames)/bin”, which is never valuable.  Thus, one could
<samp><span class="command">cat</span></samp> only C backup files by using `<samp><span class="samp">ls ${identity *.c}~</span></samp>'. 
In that case, having an alias command name <samp><span class="command">glob</span></samp> for
<samp><span class="command">identity</span></samp> would be useful.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Once symbolic mode is supported for <samp><span class="command">umask</span></samp>, implement <samp><span class="command">chmod</span></samp> in Lisp
<br><dt>Create <code>eshell-expand-file-name</code>
</dt>
</dt>
<dd>
This would use a data table to transform things such as `<samp><span class="samp">~+</span></samp>',
`<samp><span class="samp">...</span></samp>', etc.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Abstract <samp><span class="file">em-smart.el</span></samp> into <samp><span class="file">smart-scroll.el</span></samp>
</dt>
<dd>
It only really needs: to be hooked onto the output filter and the
pre-command hook, and to have the input-end and input-start markers. 
And to know whether the last output group was “successful.”

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Allow for fully persisting the state of Eshell</dt>
<dd>
This would include: variables, history, buffer, input, dir stack, etc.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Implement D as an argument predicate</dt>
<dd>
It means that files beginning with a dot should be included in the
glob match.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>A comma in a predicate list should mean OR</dt>
<dd>
At the moment, this is not supported.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Error if a glob doesn't expand due to a predicate</dt>
<dd>
An error should be generated only if <code>eshell-error-if-no-glob</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">(+ RET SPC TAB</span></samp>' does not cause <code>indent-according-to-mode</code> to occur
<br><dt>Create <code>eshell-auto-accumulate-list</code>
</dt>
</dt>
<dd>
This is a list of commands for which, if the user presses <kbd>RET</kbd>, the
text is staged as the next Eshell command, rather than being sent to the
current interactive process.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Display file and line number if an error occurs in a script
<br><dt>
<samp><span class="command">wait</span></samp> doesn't work with process ids at the moment
<br><dt>Enable the direct-to-process input code in <samp><span class="file">em-term.el</span></samp>
<br><dt>Problem with repeating `<samp><span class="samp">echo ${find /tmp}</span></samp>'</dt>
</dt>
</dt>
</dt>
<dd>
With smart display active, if <kbd>RET</kbd> is held down, after a while it
can't keep up anymore and starts outputting blank lines.  It only
happens if an asynchronous process is involved<small class="dots">...</small>

     <p>I think the problem is that <code>eshell-send-input</code> is resetting the
input target location, so that if the asynchronous process is not done
by the time the next <kbd>RET</kbd> is received, the input processor thinks
that the input is meant for the process; which, when smart display is
enabled, will be the text of the last command line!  That is a bug in
itself.

     </p>
<p>In holding down <kbd>RET</kbd> while an asynchronous process is running,
there will be a point in between termination of the process, and the
running of <code>eshell-post-command-hook</code>, which would cause
<code>eshell-send-input</code> to call <code>eshell-copy-old-input</code>, and then
process that text as a command to be run after the process.  Perhaps
there should be a way of killing pending input between the death of the
process, and the <code>post-command-hook</code>.

     <br></p>
</dd>
<dt>Allow for a more aggressive smart display mode</dt>
<dd>
Perhaps toggled by a command, that makes each output block a smart
display block.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Create more meta variables</dt>
<dd>
          <dl>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">$!</span></samp>'</dt>
<dd>The reason for the failure of the last disk command, or the text of the
last Lisp error.

          <br>
</dd>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">$=</span></samp>'</dt>
<dd>A special associate array, which can take references of the form
`<samp><span class="samp">$=[REGEXP]</span></samp>'.  It indexes into the directory ring. 
</dd>
</dl>

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Eshell scripts can't execute in the background
<br><dt>Support zsh's “Parameter Expansion” syntax, i.e., `<samp><span class="samp">${</span><var>name</var><span class="samp">:-</span><var>val</var><span class="samp">}</span></samp>'
<br><dt>Write an <samp><span class="command">info</span></samp> alias that can take arguments</dt>
</dt>
</dt>
<dd>
So that the user can enter `<samp><span class="samp">info chmod</span></samp>', for example.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Create a mode <code>eshell-browse</code>
</dt>
<dd>
It would treat the Eshell buffer as a outline.  Collapsing the outline
hides all of the output text.  Collapsing again would show only the
first command run in each directory

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Allow other revisions of a file to be referenced using `<samp><span class="samp">file{rev}</span></samp>'</dt>
<dd>
This would be expanded by <code>eshell-expand-file-name</code> (see above).

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Print “You have new mail” when the “Mail” icon is turned on
<br><dt>Implement <kbd>M-|</kbd> for Eshell
<br><dt>Implement input redirection</dt>
</dt>
</dt>
<dd>
If it's a Lisp function, input redirection implies <samp><span class="command">xargs</span></samp> (in a
way<small class="dots">...</small>).  If input redirection is added, also update the
<code>file-name-quote-list</code>, and the delimiter list.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Allow `<samp><span class="samp">#&lt;</span><var>word</var> <var>arg</var><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>' as a generic syntax</dt>
<dd>
With the handling of <em>word</em> specified by an
<code>eshell-special-alist</code>.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>In <code>eshell-eval-using-options</code>, allow a <code>:complete</code> tag</dt>
<dd>
It would be used to provide completion rules for that command.  Then the
macro will automagically define the completion function.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>For <code>eshell-command-on-region</code>, apply redirections to the result</dt>
<dd>
So that `<samp><span class="samp">+ &gt; 'blah</span></samp>' would cause the result of the <code>+</code> (using
input from the current region) to be inserting into the symbol
<code>blah</code>.

     <p>If an external command is being invoked, the input is sent as standard
input, as if a `<samp><span class="samp">cat &lt;region&gt; |</span></samp>' had been invoked.

     </p>
<p>If a Lisp command, or an alias, is invoked, then if the line has no
newline characters, it is divided by whitespace and passed as arguments
to the Lisp function.  Otherwise, it is divided at the newline
characters.  Thus, invoking <code>+</code> on a series of numbers will add
them; <code>min</code> would display the smallest figure, etc.

     <br></p>
</dd>
<dt>Write <code>eshell-script-mode</code> as a minor mode</dt>
<dd>
It would provide syntax, abbrev, highlighting and indenting support like
<code>emacs-lisp-mode</code> and <code>shell-mode</code>.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>In the history mechanism, finish the Bash-style support</dt>
<dd>
This means `<samp><span class="samp">!n</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">!#</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">!:%</span></samp>', and `<samp><span class="samp">!:1-</span></samp>' as separate
from `<samp><span class="samp">!:1*</span></samp>'.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Support the -n command line option for <samp><span class="command">history</span></samp>
<br><dt>Implement <samp><span class="command">fc</span></samp> in Lisp
<br><dt>Specifying a frame as a redirection target should imply the currently active window's buffer
<br><dt>Implement `<samp><span class="samp">&gt;</span><var>func-or-func-list</var></samp>'</dt>
</dt>
</dt>
</dt>
<dd>
This would allow for an “output translators”, that take a function to
modify output with, and a target.  Devise a syntax that works well with
pipes, and can accommodate multiple functions (i.e., `<samp><span class="samp">&gt;'(upcase
regexp-quote)</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">&gt;'upcase</span></samp>').

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Allow Eshell to read/write to/from standard input and output</dt>
<dd>
This would be optional, rather than always using the Eshell buffer. 
This would allow it to be run from the command line (perhaps).

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Write a <samp><span class="command">help</span></samp> command</dt>
<dd>
It would call subcommands with <samp><span class="option">--help</span></samp>, or <samp><span class="option">-h</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="option">/?</span></samp>, as appropriate.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Implement <samp><span class="command">stty</span></samp> in Lisp
<br><dt>Support <samp><span class="command">rc</span></samp>'s matching operator, e.g., `<samp><span class="samp">~ (</span><var>list</var><span class="samp">) </span><var>regexp</var></samp>'
<br><dt>Implement <samp><span class="command">bg</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">fg</span></samp> as editors of <code>eshell-process-list</code>
</dt>
</dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Using <samp><span class="command">bg</span></samp> on a process that is already in the background does
nothing.  Specifying redirection targets replaces (or adds) to the list
current being used.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Have <samp><span class="command">jobs</span></samp> print only the processes for the current shell
<br><dt>How can Eshell learn if a background process has requested input?
<br><dt>Support `<samp><span class="samp">2&gt;&amp;1</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">&gt;&amp;</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">2&gt;</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">|&amp;</span></samp>'</dt>
</dt>
</dt>
<dd>
The syntax table for parsing these should be customizable, such that the
user could change it to use rc syntax: `<samp><span class="samp">&gt;[2=1]</span></samp>'.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Allow `<samp><span class="samp">$_[-1]</span></samp>', which would indicate the last element of the array
<br><dt>Make `<samp><span class="samp">$x[*]</span></samp>' equal to listing out the full contents of `<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>'</dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Return them as a list, so that `<samp><span class="samp">$_[*]</span></samp>' is all the arguments of the
last command.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Copy ANSI code handling from <samp><span class="file">term.el</span></samp> into <samp><span class="file">em-term.el</span></samp>
</dt>
<dd>
Make it possible for the user to send char-by-char to the underlying
process.  Ultimately, I should be able to move away from using term.el
altogether, since everything but the ANSI code handling is already part
of Eshell.  Then, things would work correctly on MS-Windows as well
(which doesn't have <samp><span class="file">/bin/sh</span></samp>, although <samp><span class="file">term.el</span></samp> tries to use
it).

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Make the shell spawning commands be visual</dt>
<dd>
That is, make (<samp><span class="command">su</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">bash</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">telnet</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="command">rlogin</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">rsh</span></samp>, etc.) be part of
<code>eshell-visual-commands</code>.  The only exception is if the shell is
being used to invoke a single command.  Then, the behavior should be
based on what that command is.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Create a smart viewing command named <samp><span class="command">open</span></samp>
</dt>
<dd>
This would search for some way to open its argument (similar to opening
a file in the Windows Explorer).

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Alias <samp><span class="command">read</span></samp> to be the same as <samp><span class="command">open</span></samp>, only read-only
<br><dt>Write a <samp><span class="command">tail</span></samp> command which uses <code>view-file</code>
</dt>
</dt>
<dd>
It would move point to the end of the buffer, and then turns on
auto-revert mode in that buffer at frequent intervals—and a
<samp><span class="command">head</span></samp> alias which assumes an upper limit of
<code>eshell-maximum-line-length</code> characters per line.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Make <samp><span class="command">dgrep</span></samp> load <code>dired</code>, mark everything, then invoke <code>dired-do-search</code>
<br><dt>Write <samp><span class="file">mesh.c</span></samp>
</dt>
</dt>
<dd>
This would run Emacs with the appropriate arguments to invoke Eshell
only.  That way, it could be listed as a login shell.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Use an intangible <code>PS2</code> string for multi-line input prompts
<br><dt>Auto-detect when a command is visual, by checking <code>TERMCAP</code> usage
<br><dt>The first keypress after <kbd>M-x watson</kbd> triggers</dt>

<dd>
<code>eshell-send-input</code>

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Make <kbd>/</kbd> electric</dt>
<dd>
So that it automatically expands and corrects pathnames.  Or make
pathname completion for Pcomplete auto-expand `<samp><span class="samp">/u/i/std&lt;TAB&gt;</span></samp>' to
`<samp><span class="samp">/usr/include/std&lt;TAB&gt;</span></samp>'.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Write the <samp><span class="command">pushd</span></samp> stack to disk along with <code>last-dir-ring</code>
<br><dt>Add options to <code>eshell/cat</code> which would allow it to sort and uniq
<br><dt>Implement <samp><span class="command">wc</span></samp> in Lisp</dt>
</dt>
</dt>
<dd>
Add support for counting sentences, paragraphs, pages, etc.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Once piping is added, implement <samp><span class="command">sort</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">uniq</span></samp> in Lisp
<br><dt>Implement <samp><span class="command">touch</span></samp> in Lisp
<br><dt>Implement <samp><span class="command">comm</span></samp> in Lisp
<br><dt>Implement an <samp><span class="command">epatch</span></samp> command in Lisp</dt>
</dt>
</dt>
</dt>
<dd>
This would call <code>ediff-patch-file</code>, or <code>ediff-patch-buffer</code>,
depending on its argument.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Have an option such that `<samp><span class="samp">ls -l</span></samp>' generates a dired buffer
<br><dt>Write a version of <samp><span class="command">xargs</span></samp> based on command rewriting</dt>
</dt>
<dd>
That is, `<samp><span class="samp">find X | xargs Y</span></samp>' would be indicated using `<samp><span class="samp">Y
${find X}</span></samp>'.  Maybe <code>eshell-do-pipelines</code> could be changed to
perform this on-thy-fly rewriting.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Write an alias for <samp><span class="command">less</span></samp> that brings up a <code>view-mode</code> buffer</dt>
<dd>
Such that the user can press &lt;SPC&gt; and &lt;DEL&gt;, and then &lt;q&gt;
to return to Eshell.  It would be equivalent to:
`<samp><span class="samp">X &gt; #&lt;buffer Y&gt;; view-buffer #&lt;buffer Y&gt;</span></samp>'.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Make <code>eshell-mode</code> as much a full citizen as <code>shell-mode</code>
</dt>
<dd>
Everywhere in Emacs where <code>shell-mode</code> is specially noticed, add
<code>eshell-mode</code> there.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>Permit the umask to be selectively set on a <samp><span class="command">cp</span></samp> target
<br><dt>Problem using <kbd>M-x eshell</kbd> after using <code>eshell-command</code>
</dt>
</dt>
<dd>
If the first thing that I do after entering Emacs is to run
<code>eshell-command</code> and invoke <samp><span class="command">ls</span></samp>, and then use <kbd>M-x
eshell</kbd>, it doesn't display anything.

     <br>

<dt>
<kbd>M-RET</kbd> during a long command (using smart display) doesn't work</dt>

Since it keeps the cursor up where the command was invoked.

<!-- The GNU Free Documentation License. -->

<pre class="display">     Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <a href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a>
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>
     <ol type="1" start="0">
<li>PREAMBLE

     <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <dfn>free</dfn> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. 
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

     </p>
<p>This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

     </p>
<p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

     </p>
</li>
<li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     <p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The “Document”, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as “you”.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

     </p>
<p>A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

     </p>
<p>A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

     </p>
<p>The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

     </p>
<p>The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

     </p>
<p>A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. 
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

     </p>
<p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, SGML or XML using a publicly available
DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and
JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

     </p>
<p>The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title Page” means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     </p>
<p>The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.

     </p>
<p>A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as “Acknowledgements”,
“Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)  To “Preserve the Title”
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section “Entitled XYZ” according to this definition.

     </p>
<p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

     </p>
</li>
<li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     </p>
<p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     </p>
</li>
<li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     </p>
<p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     </p>
<p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. 
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

     </p>
<p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     </p>
</li>
<li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

          </p>
<ol type="A" start="1">
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

          </li>
<li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

          </li>
<li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

          </li>
<li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

          </li>
<li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

          </li>
<li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

          </li>
<li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

          </li>
<li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

          </li>
<li>Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled “History” in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

          </li>
<li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the “History” section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

          </li>
<li>For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

          </li>
<li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

          </li>
<li>Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

          </li>
<li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled “Endorsements” or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

          </li>
<li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          </li>
</ol>

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     </p>
<p>You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     </p>
<p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     </p>
<p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     </p>
</li>
<li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

     </p>
<p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     </p>
<p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled “History”
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
“History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You must delete all
sections Entitled “Endorsements.”

     </p>
</li>
<li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     </p>
<p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     </p>
</li>
<li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. 
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

     </p>
<p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. 
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

     </p>
</li>
<li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     </p>
<p>If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
“Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

     </p>
</li>
<li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     </p>
<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

     </p>
<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

     </p>
<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

     </p>
</li>
<li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

     </p>
<p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

     </p>
</li>
<li>RELICENSING

     <p>“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.

     </p>
<p>“CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

     </p>
<p>“Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.

     </p>
<p>An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

     </p>
<p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

        </p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="heading">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">       Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the “with<small class="dots">...</small>Texts.” line with this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">         with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being <var>list</var>.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   </p>
<p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
