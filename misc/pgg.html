<h2 class="chapter">1 Overview</h2>

<p>PGG is an interface library between Emacs and various tools for secure
communication.  Even though Mailcrypt has similar feature, it does not
deal with detached PGP messages, normally used in PGP/MIME
infrastructure.  This was the main reason why I wrote the new library.

   </p>
<p>Note that the PGG library is now obsolete, replaced by EasyPG. 
See <a href="epa.html#Top">EasyPG</a>.

   </p>
<p>PGP/MIME is an application of MIME Object Security Services (RFC1848). 
The standard is documented in RFC2015.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Prerequisites"></a></div>

<h2 class="chapter">2 Prerequisites</h2>

<p>PGG requires at least one implementation of privacy guard system. 
This document assumes that you have already obtained and installed them
and that you are familiar with its basic functions.

   </p>
<p>By default, PGG uses GnuPG.  If you are new to such a system, I
recommend that you should look over the GNU Privacy Handbook (GPH)
which is available at <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/documentation/">http://www.gnupg.org/documentation/</a>.

   </p>
<p>When using GnuPG, we recommend the use of the <code>gpg-agent</code>
program, which is distributed with versions 2.0 and later of GnuPG. 
This is a daemon to manage private keys independently from any
protocol, and provides the most secure way to input and cache your
passphrases (see <a href="#Caching-passphrase">Caching passphrase</a>).  By default, PGG will
attempt to use <code>gpg-agent</code> if it is running.  See <a href="gnupg.html#Invoking-GPG_002dAGENT">Invoking GPG-AGENT</a>.

   </p>
<p>PGG also supports Pretty Good Privacy version 2 or version 5.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="How-to-use"></a></div>

<h2 class="chapter">3 How to use</h2>

<p>The toplevel interface of this library is quite simple, and only
intended to use with public-key cryptographic operation.

   </p>
<p>To use PGG, evaluate following expression at the beginning of your
application program.

</p>
<pre class="lisp">     (require 'pgg)
</pre>
   <p>If you want to check existence of pgg.el at runtime, instead you can
list autoload setting for desired functions as follows.

</p>
<pre class="lisp">     (autoload 'pgg-encrypt-region "pgg"
       "Encrypt the current region." t)
     (autoload 'pgg-encrypt-symmetric-region "pgg"
       "Encrypt the current region with symmetric algorithm." t)
     (autoload 'pgg-decrypt-region "pgg"
       "Decrypt the current region." t)
     (autoload 'pgg-sign-region "pgg"
       "Sign the current region." t)
     (autoload 'pgg-verify-region "pgg"
       "Verify the current region." t)
     (autoload 'pgg-insert-key "pgg"
       "Insert the ASCII armored public key." t)
     (autoload 'pgg-snarf-keys-region "pgg"
       "Import public keys in the current region." t)

<h3 class="section">3.1 User Commands</h3>

<p>At this time you can use some cryptographic commands.  The behavior of
these commands relies on a fashion of invocation because they are also
intended to be used as library functions.  In case you don't have the
signer's public key, for example, the function <code>pgg-verify-region</code>
fails immediately, but if the function had been called interactively, it
would ask you to retrieve the signer's public key from the server.

</p>
<div class="defun">

        </p>
<p>If encryption is successful, it replaces the current region contents (in
the accessible portion) with the resulting data.

        </p>
<p>If optional argument <var>sign</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, the function is
request to do a combined sign and encrypt.  This currently is
confirmed to work with GnuPG, but might not work with PGP or PGP5.

<div class="node"><a name="Selecting-an-implementation"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">3.2 Selecting an implementation</h3>

<p>Since PGP has a long history and there are a number of PGP
implementations available today, the function which each one has differs
considerably.  For example, if you are using GnuPG, you know you can
select cipher algorithm from 3DES, CAST5, BLOWFISH, and so on, but on
the other hand the version 2 of PGP only supports IDEA.

   </p>
<p>Which implementation is used is controlled by the <code>pgg-scheme</code>
variable.  If it is <code>nil</code> (the default), the value of the
<code>pgg-default-scheme</code> variable will be used instead.

</p>
<div class="defun">
— Variable: <b>pgg-scheme</b><var><a name="index-pgg_002dscheme-8"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Force specify the scheme of PGP implementation.  The value can be set to
<code>gpg</code>, <code>pgp</code>, and <code>pgp5</code>.  The default is <code>nil</code>. 
</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div class="defun">
— Variable: <b>pgg-default-scheme</b><var><a name="index-pgg_002ddefault_002dscheme-9"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The default scheme of PGP implementation.  The value should be one of
<code>gpg</code>, <code>pgp</code>, and <code>pgp5</code>.  The default is <code>gpg</code>. 
</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div class="node"><a name="Caching-passphrase"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">3.3 Caching passphrase</h3>

<p>When using GnuPG (gpg) as the PGP scheme, we recommend using a program
called <code>gpg-agent</code> for entering and caching
passphrases<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.

</p>
<div class="defun">
— Variable: <b>pgg-gpg-use-agent</b><var><a name="index-pgg_002dgpg_002duse_002dagent-10"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If non-<code>nil</code>, attempt to use <code>gpg-agent</code> whenever possible. 
The default is <code>t</code>.  If <code>gpg-agent</code> is not running, or GnuPG
is not the current PGP scheme, PGG's own passphrase-caching mechanism
is used (see below). 
</p></blockquote>
</div>

   <p>To use <code>gpg-agent</code> with PGG, you must first ensure that
<code>gpg-agent</code> is running.  For example, if you are running in the X
Window System, you can do this by putting the following line in your
<samp><span class="file">.xsession</span></samp> file:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     eval "$(gpg-agent --daemon)"
</pre>
   <p>For more details on invoking <code>gpg-agent</code>, See <a href="gnupg.html#Invoking-GPG_002dAGENT">Invoking GPG-AGENT</a>.

   </p>
<p>Whenever you perform a PGG operation that requires a GnuPG passphrase,
GnuPG will contact <code>gpg-agent</code>, which prompts you for the
passphrase.  Furthermore, <code>gpg-agent</code> “caches” the result, so
that subsequent uses will not require you to enter the passphrase
again.  (This cache usually expires after a certain time has passed;
you can change this using the <code>--default-cache-ttl</code> option when
invoking <code>gpg-agent</code>.)

   </p>
<p>If you are running in a X Window System environment, <code>gpg-agent</code>
prompts for a passphrase by opening a graphical window.  However, if
you are running Emacs on a text terminal, <code>gpg-agent</code> has trouble
receiving input from the terminal, since it is being sent to Emacs. 
One workaround for this problem is to run <code>gpg-agent</code> on a
different terminal from Emacs, with the <code>--keep-tty</code> option; this
tells <code>gpg-agent</code> use its own terminal to prompt for passphrases.

   </p>
<p>When <code>gpg-agent</code> is not being used, PGG prompts for a passphrase
through Emacs.  It also has its own passphrase caching mechanism,
which is controlled by the variable <code>pgg-cache-passphrase</code> (see
below).

   </p>
<p>There is a security risk in handling passphrases through PGG rather
than <code>gpg-agent</code>.  When you enter your passphrase into an Emacs
prompt, it is temporarily stored as a cleartext string in the memory
of the Emacs executable.  If the executable memory is swapped to disk,
the root user can, in theory, extract the passphrase from the
swapfile.  Furthermore, the swapfile containing the cleartext
passphrase might remain on the disk after the system is discarded or
stolen.  <code>gpg-agent</code> avoids this problem by using certain tricks,
such as memory locking, which have not been implemented in Emacs.

</p>
<div class="defun">
— Variable: <b>pgg-cache-passphrase</b><var><a name="index-pgg_002dcache_002dpassphrase-11"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If non-<code>nil</code>, store passphrases.  The default value of this
variable is <code>t</code>.  If you are worried about security issues,
however, you could stop the caching of passphrases by setting this
variable to <code>nil</code>. 
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Elapsed time for expiration in seconds. 
</p></blockquote>
</div>

   <p>If your passphrase contains non-ASCII characters, you might need to
specify the coding system to be used to encode your passphrases, since
GnuPG treats them as a byte sequence, not as a character sequence.

</p>

<div class="node"><a name="Architecture"></a></div>

<h2 class="chapter">4 Architecture</h2>

<p>PGG introduces the notion of a "scheme of PGP implementation" (used
interchangeably with "scheme" in this document).  This term refers to a
singleton object wrapped with the luna object system.

   </p>
<p>Since PGG was designed for accessing and developing PGP functionality,
the architecture had to be designed not just for interoperability but
also for extensibility.  In this chapter we explore the architecture
while finding out how to write the PGG back end.

</li>
</ul>

<div class="node"><a name="Initializing"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">4.1 Initializing</h3>

<p>A scheme must be initialized before it is used. 
It had better guarantee to keep only one instance of a scheme.

   </p>
<p>The following code is snipped out of <samp><span class="file">pgg-gpg.el</span></samp>.  Once an
instance of <code>pgg-gpg</code> scheme is initialized, it's stored to the
variable <code>pgg-scheme-gpg-instance</code> and will be reused from now on.

</p>
<pre class="lisp">     (defvar pgg-scheme-gpg-instance nil)
     
     (defun pgg-make-scheme-gpg ()
       (or pgg-scheme-gpg-instance
           (setq pgg-scheme-gpg-instance
                 (luna-make-entity 'pgg-scheme-gpg))))

<pre class="display">     Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <a href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a>
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>
     <ol type="1" start="0">
<li>PREAMBLE

     <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <dfn>free</dfn> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. 
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

     </p>
<p>This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

     </p>
<p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

     </p>
</li>
<li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     <p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The “Document”, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as “you”.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

     </p>
<p>A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

     </p>
<p>A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

     </p>
<p>The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

     </p>
<p>The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

     </p>
<p>A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. 
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

     </p>
<p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, SGML or XML using a publicly available
DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and
JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

     </p>
<p>The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title Page” means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     </p>
<p>The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.

     </p>
<p>A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as “Acknowledgements”,
“Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)  To “Preserve the Title”
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section “Entitled XYZ” according to this definition.

     </p>
<p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

     </p>
</li>
<li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     </p>
<p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     </p>
</li>
<li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     </p>
<p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     </p>
<p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. 
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

     </p>
<p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     </p>
</li>
<li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

          </p>
<ol type="A" start="1">
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

          </li>
<li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

          </li>
<li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

          </li>
<li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

          </li>
<li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

          </li>
<li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

          </li>
<li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

          </li>
<li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

          </li>
<li>Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled “History” in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

          </li>
<li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the “History” section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

          </li>
<li>For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

          </li>
<li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

          </li>
<li>Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

          </li>
<li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled “Endorsements” or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

          </li>
<li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          </li>
</ol>

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     </p>
<p>You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     </p>
<p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     </p>
<p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     </p>
</li>
<li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

     </p>
<p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     </p>
<p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled “History”
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
“History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You must delete all
sections Entitled “Endorsements.”

     </p>
</li>
<li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     </p>
<p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     </p>
</li>
<li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. 
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

     </p>
<p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. 
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

     </p>
</li>
<li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     </p>
<p>If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
“Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

     </p>
</li>
<li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     </p>
<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

     </p>
<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

     </p>
<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

     </p>
</li>
<li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

     </p>
<p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

     </p>
</li>
<li>RELICENSING

     <p>“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.

     </p>
<p>“CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

     </p>
<p>“Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.

     </p>
<p>An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

     </p>
<p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

        </p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="heading">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">       Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the “with<small class="dots">...</small>Texts.” line with this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">         with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being <var>list</var>.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   </p>
<p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
