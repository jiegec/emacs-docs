<h2 class="unnumbered">SRecoder Manual</h2>

<p><i>SRecode</i> is the <i>Semantic Recoder</i>.  Where <i>Semantic</i> will parse
source files into lists of tags, the <i>Semantic Recoder</i> will aid in
converting <i>Semantic</i> tags and various other information back into
various types of code.

   </p>
<p>While the <i>SRecode</i> tool provides a template language, templates for
several languages, and even a sequence of heuristics that aid the user
in choosing a template to insert, this is not the main goal of
<i>SRecode</i>.

   </p>
<p>The goal of <i>SRecode</i> is to provide an application framework where
someone can write a complex code generator, and the underlying
template commonality allows it to work in multiple languages with
ease.

<h2 class="chapter">1 Quick Start</h2>

<p>When you install CEDET and enable <i>SRecode</i>, an <code>SRecoder</code> menu
item should appear.

   </p>
<p>To toggle <i>SRecode</i> minor mode on and off use:

</p>
<pre class="example">     M-x srecode-minor-mode RET
</pre>
   <p>or
</p>
<pre class="example">     M-x global-srecode-minor-mode RET
</pre>
   <p>or add

</p>
<pre class="example">     (srecode-minor-mode 1)
</pre>
   <p>into a language hook function to force it on (which is the default) or
pass in <code>-1</code> to force it off.

   </p>
<p>See <a href="#SRecode-Minor-Mode">SRecode Minor Mode</a> for more on using the minor mode.

   </p>
<p>Use the menu to insert templates into the current file.

   </p>
<p>You can add your own templates in <samp><span class="file">~/.srecode</span></samp>, or update the
template map path:

</p>
<div class="defun">
— Option: <b>srecode-map-load-path</b><var><a name="index-srecode_002dmap_002dload_002dpath-1"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="srecode_002dmap_002dload_002dpath"></a>
Global load path for SRecode template files. 
</p></blockquote>
</div>

   <p>Once installed, you can start inserting templates using the menu, or
the command:

</p>
<div class="defun">
— Command: <b>srecode-insert</b><var> template-name &amp;rest dict-entries<a name="index-srecode_002dinsert-2"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="srecode_002dinsert"></a>
Insert the template <var>template-name</var> into the current buffer at point. 
<var>dict-entries</var> are additional dictionary values to add. 
</p></blockquote>
</div>

   <p>SRecode Insert will prompt for a template name.  Template names are
specific to each major mode.  A typical name is of the form:
<code>CONTEXT:NAME</code> where a <var>CONTEXT</var> might be something like
<code>file</code> or <code>declaration</code>.  The same <var>NAME</var> can occur in
multiple contexts.

</p>
<pagebreak></pagebreak><div class="node"><a name="User-Templates"></a></div>

<h2 class="chapter">2 User Templates</h2>

<p><i>SRecode</i> builds and maintains a map of all template files.  The root
template files resides in the <i>SRecode</i> distribution.  User written
templates files are saved in <samp><span class="file">~/.srecode</span></samp>, along with the
<i>SRecode</i> map file.

</p>
<div class="defun">
— Variable: <b>srecode-map-save-file</b><var><a name="index-srecode_002dmap_002dsave_002dfile-3"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="srecode_002dmap_002dsave_002dfile"></a>
The save location for SRecode's map file. 
</p></blockquote>
</div>

   <p>Template files end with a <samp><span class="file">.srt</span></samp> extension.  Details on how to
write templates are in <a href="#Template-Writing">Template Writing</a>.

   </p>
<p>Each template file you write is dedicated to a single major mode.  In
it, you can write templates within the same context and with the same
name as core templates.  You can force your templates to override the
core templates for a particular major mode by setting the
priority.  See <a href="#Special-Variables">Special Variables</a>.

   </p>
<p>To get going quickly, open a new <samp><span class="file">.srt</span></samp> file.  It will start in
the <i>SRecode</i> template writing mode.  Use the <i>SRecode</i> minor mode
menu to insert the <code>empty</code> file template.

   </p>
<p>When using templates in other modes (such as C++ or Emacs Lisp
templates), use the “Edit Template” menu to find a template you
would like to update.  Copy it into your user template file, and
change it.

   </p>
<p>If you were to update <code>declaration:function</code> in your user
template file, then you would get this new template instead of the one
that comes with <i>SRecode</i>.  Higher level applications should always
use <code>declaration:function</code> when generating their own code, so
higher level templates will then adopt your changes to
<code>declaration:function</code> into themselves.

   </p>
<p>You can also override variables.  Core variables are stored in the
<i>SRecode</i> root template file <samp><span class="file">default.srt</span></samp>, and that contains
the copyright usually used, and some basic file setup formats. 
Override variables like this by specifying a <code>mode</code> of
<code>default</code> like this:

</p>
<pre class="example">     set mode "default"
</pre>
   <pagebreak></pagebreak><div class="node"><a name="Parts-of-SRecode"></a></div>

<h2 class="chapter">3 Parts of SRecode</h2>

<p>The <i>SRecode</i> system is made up of several layers which work together
to generate code.

</p>
<h3 class="section">3.1 Template Layer</h3>

<p>The template layer provides a way to write, and compile templates.  The
template layer is the scheme used to insert text into an Emacs buffer.

   </p>
<p>The <i>SRecode</i> template layer is more advanced than other modes like the
Emacs packages <code>skeleton</code> or <code>tempo</code> in that it allows
multiple layers of templates to be created with the same names.  This
means that <i>SRecode</i> can provide a wide range of templates, and users
can override only the small sections they want, instead of either
accepting someone else's template, or writing large new templates of
their own.

   </p>
<p>Templates are written in <samp><span class="file">.srt</span></samp> files.  You can learn how to
author new <samp><span class="file">.srt</span></samp> files <a href="#Template-Writing">Template Writing</a>.

   </p>
<p>While the template system was designed for <i>SRecode</i> based
applications it can also be used independently for simple template
insertion during typical coding.

</p>
<h3 class="section">3.2 Template Manager</h3>

<p>Once templates have been written, a scheme for loading and selecting
templates is needed.  The template manager has a loader for finding
template files, and determining which templates are relevant to the
current buffer.  Template files are sorted by priority, with user
templates being found first, and system level default templates last. 
Templates are also sorted by application.  Each application has its
own templates, and are kept separate from the generic templates.

</p>
<h3 class="section">3.3 Dictionary</h3>

<p>Dictionaries contain values associated with variable.  Variables are
used in macros in a template.  Variables are what allows a generic
template such as a function to be made specific, such as a function
named foo.  The value of a variable can be one of three things; a
string, a list of more dictionaries, or a special
<code>srecode-dictionary-compound-value</code> object subclass.  See
<a href="#Variables">Variables</a> for more.

</p>
<h3 class="section">3.4 Template Insertion</h3>

<p>The template insertion layer involves extensions to the basic template
layer.  A wide range of custom variables are available for mixing derived
data as macros into the plain text of a template.

   </p>
<p>In addition, templates can be declared with arguments.  These
arguments represent predetermined sets of dictionary values, such as
features of the current file name, user name, time, etc.

   </p>
<p>Some arguments are major-mode specific, such as the <code>:el</code> or
<code>:cpp</code> arguments.

</p>
<h3 class="section">3.5 Template Insertion Context</h3>

<p>A context can be provided for templates in a file.  This helps
auto-selection of templates by name, or allows templates in different
contexts to have the same name.  Some standard contexts are
<code>file</code>, <code>declaration</code>, and <code>classdecl</code>.

   </p>
<p>A context can be automatically derived as well based on the parsing
state from <i>Semantic</i>.  see <a href="semantic.html#Top">Semantic Manual</a>.

</p>
<h3 class="section">3.6 Applications</h3>

<p>Commands that do a particular user task which involves also writing
Emacs Lisp code.  Applications are at the top layer.  These
applications have their own template files and logic needed to fill in
dictionaries or position a cursor.  SRecode comes with an example
<code>srecode-document</code> application for creating comments for Semantic
tags.  The CEDET application <i>EDE</i> has a project type that is an
<i>SRecode</i> application.

</p>
<h3 class="section">3.7 Field Editing</h3>

<p>If the variable <code>srecode-insert-ask-variable-method</code> is set to
'field, then variables that would normally ask a question, will
instead create “fields” in the buffer.  A field-editing layer
provides simple interaction through the fields.  Typing in a field
will cause all variable locations that are the same to edit at the
same time.  Pressing TAB on a field will move you to the next field.

</p>
<pagebreak></pagebreak><div class="node"><a name="SRecode-Minor-Mode"></a></div>

<h2 class="chapter">4 SRecode Minor Mode</h2>

<p>The Semantic Recode minor mode enables a keymap and menu that provides
simple access to different templates or template applications.

   </p>
<p>The key prefix is &lt;C-c /&gt;.

   </p>
<p>If the variable <code>srecode-takeover-INS-key</code> is set, then the key
&lt;&lt;insert&gt;&gt; can also be used.

   </p>
<p>The most important key is bound to <code>srecode-insert</code> which is
&lt;C-c / /&gt;, or &lt;insert insert&gt;.  <a href="#Quick-Start">Quick Start</a>.

   </p>
<p>Major keybindings are:

     </p>
<dl>
<dt>&lt;C-c / /&gt;</dt>
<dd>Insert a template whose name is typed into the minibuffer. 
<br>
</dd>
<dt>&lt;C-c / &lt;lower case letter&gt;&gt;</dt>
<dd>Reserved for direct binding of simple templates to keys using a
keybinding command in the template file. 
<br>
</dd>
<dt>&lt;C-c / &lt;upper case letter&gt;&gt;</dt>
<dd>Reserved for template applications (Such as comment or get/set inserter.) 
<br>
</dd>
<dt>&lt;C-c / E&gt;</dt>
<dd>Edit the code of a template. 
<br>
</dd>
<dt>&lt;C-c / .&gt;</dt>
<dd>Insert template again.  This will cause the previously inserted
template to be inserted again. 
</dd>
</dl>

<h3 class="section">4.1 Field Editing</h3>

<p>By default, when inserting a template, if the user needs to enter text
to fill in a part of the template, then the minibuffer is used to
query for that information.  SRecode also supports a field-editing mode
that can be used instead.  To enable it set:

</p>
<div class="defun">
— Function: <b>srecode-insert-ask-variable-method</b><var><a name="index-srecode_002dinsert_002dask_002dvariable_002dmethod-4"></a></var><br>
<blockquote>
<p><a name="srecode_002dinsert_002dask_002dvariable_002dmethod"></a>
Determine how to ask for a dictionary value when inserting a template. 
Only the <var>ASK</var> style inserter will query the user for a value. 
Dictionary value references that ask begin with the ? character. 
Possible values are:
          </p>
<dl>
<dt><code>ask</code></dt>
<dd>Prompt in the minibuffer as the value is inserted. 
<br>
</dd>
<dt><code>field</code></dt>
<dd>Use the dictionary macro name as the inserted value,
and place a field there.  Matched fields change together. 
</dd>
</dl>

        <p><b>NOTE</b>: The field feature does not yet work with XEmacs. 
</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

   <p>Field editing mode is supported in newer versions of Emacs.  You
will not be prompted to fill in values while the template is
inserted.  Instead, short regions will be highlighted, and the cursor
placed in a field.  Typing in the field will then fill in the value. 
Several fields might be linked together.  In that case, typing in one
area will modify the other linked areas.  Pressing TAB will move
between editable fields in the template.

   </p>
<p>Once the cursor moves out of the are inserted by the template, all the
fields are canceled.

   </p>
<p><b>NOTE</b>: Some conveniences in templates, such as completion, or
character restrictions are lost when using field editing mode.

</p>

<h2 class="chapter">5 Template Writing</h2>

<p><a name="g_t_0040code_007bSRecode_002dtemplate_002dmode_007d"></a>

   </p>
<p><code>srecode-template-mode</code> is the major mode used for designing new
templates.  <i>SRecode</i> files (Extension <samp><span class="file">.srt</span></samp>) are made up of
variable settings and template declarations.

   </p>
<p>Here is an overview of the terminology you will need for the next few
sections:

     </p>
<dl>
<dt>template file</dt>
<dd>A file with a <samp><span class="file">.srt</span></samp> extension which contains settings,
variables, and templates. 
<br>
</dd>
<dt>template</dt>
<dd>One named entity which represents a block of text that will be
inserted.  The text is compiled into a sequence of insertable
entities.  The entities are string constants, and macros. 
<br>
</dd>
<dt>macro</dt>
<dd>A macro is a text sequence within template text that is replaced with
some other value. 
<br>
</dd>
<dt>dictionary</dt>
<dd>A table of variable names and values. 
<br>
</dd>
<dt>subdictionary</dt>
<dd>A dictionary that is subordinate under another dictionary as a value
to some variable. 
<br>
</dd>
<dt>variable</dt>
<dd>A variable is an entry in a dictionary which has a value.

<h3 class="section">5.1 Variables</h3>

<p>Variables can be set up and used in templates.  Many variables you may
use are set up via template arguments, but some may be preferences a
user can set up that are used in system templates.

   </p>
<p>When expanding a template, variables are stored in a <dfn>dictionary</dfn>. 
Dictionary entries are variables.  Variables defined in templates can
have string like values.

   </p>
<p>A variable can be set like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">     set VARNAME "some value"
</pre>
   <p>Note that a VARIABLE is a name in a dictionary that can be used in a
MACRO in a template.  The macro references some variable by name.

</ul>

<pagebreak></pagebreak><div class="node"><a name="String-Values"></a></div>

<h4 class="subsection">5.1.1 String Values</h4>

<p>Variables can be set to strings.  Strings may contain newlines or any
other characters.  Strings are interpreted by the Emacs Lisp reader so
<code>\n</code>, <code>\t</code>, and <code>\"</code> work.

   </p>
<p>When a string is inserted as part of a template, nothing within the
string is interpreted, such as template escape characters.

</p>
<pagebreak></pagebreak><div class="node">
<a name="Multi-string-Values"></a><a name="Multi_002dstring-Values"></a>
</div>

<h4 class="subsection">5.1.2 Multi-string Values</h4>

<p>A variable can be set to multiple strings.  A compound value is
usually used when you want to use dictionary entries as part of a
variable later on.

   </p>
<p>Multi-string variable values are set like string values except there
are more than one.  For example

</p>
<pre class="example">     set NAME "this" "-mode"
</pre>
   <p>These two strings will be concatenated together.

   </p>
<p>A more useful thing is to include dictionary variables and concatenate
those into the string.  Use the “macro” keyword to include the name
of a variable.  This is like macros in a template.  For example:

</p>
<pre class="example">     set NAME macro "MODE" "-mode"
</pre>
   <p>will extract the value of the dictionary variable MODE and append
“-mode” to the end.

</p>
<pagebreak></pagebreak><div class="node"><a name="Section-Show"></a></div>

<h4 class="subsection">5.1.3 Section Show</h4>

<p>To set a variable to show a template section, use the <code>show</code>
command.  Sections are blocks of a template wrapped in section macros. 
If there is a section macro using <var>NAME</var> it will be shown for each
dictionary associated with the <var>NAME</var> macro.

</p>
<pre class="example">     show NAME
</pre>
   <p>This will enable that section.

   </p>
<p>NOTE: May 11, 2008: I haven't used this yet, so I don't know if it works.

</p>
<pagebreak></pagebreak><div class="node"><a name="Special-Variables"></a></div>

<h4 class="subsection">5.1.4 Special Variables</h4>

<p>Some variables have special meaning that changes attributes when
templates are compiled, including:

     </p>
<dl>
<dt><code>escape-start</code></dt>
<dd>This is the character sequence that escapes from raw text to template
macro names.  The ability to change the escape characters are key for
enabling <i>SRecode</i> templates to work across many kinds of languages. 
<br>
</dd>
<dt><code>escape-end</code></dt>
<dd>This is the character sequence that escapes the end of a template
macro name.

     <p>Example:
     </p>
<pre class="example">          set escape_start "$"
          set escape_end "$"
     </pre>
     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>mode</code></dt>
<dd>This is the major mode, as a string with the full Emacs Lisp symbol in
it.  All templates in this file will be installed into the template
table for this major mode.

     <p>Multiple template files can use the same mode, and all those templates
will be available in buffers of that mode.

     </p>
<p>Example:
     </p>
<pre class="example">          set mode "emacs-lisp-mode"
     </pre>
     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>priority</code></dt>
<dd>The priority of a file is a number in a string constant that
indicates where it lies in the template search order.  System
templates default to low priority numbers.  User templates default to
high priority numbers.  You can specify the priority of your template
to insert it anywhere in the template search list.

     <p>If there are multiple templates with the same context and name, the
template with the highest priority number will be used.

     </p>
<p>If multiple files have the same priority, then then sort order is
unpredictable.  If no template names match, then it doesn't matter.

     </p>
<p>Example:
     </p>
<pre class="example">          set priority "35"
     </pre>
     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>application</code></dt>
<dd>If a template file contains templates only needed for a particular
application, then specify an application.  Template files for an
application are stored in the template repository, but are not used in
the generic template insertion case.

     <p>The application with a particular name will access these templates
from Lisp code.

     </p>
<p>Example:
     </p>
<pre class="example">          set application "document"
     </pre>
     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>project</code></dt>
<dd>If a template file contains templates, or template overrides specific
to a set of files under a particular directory, then that template
file can specify a “project” that it belongs to.

     <p>Set the “project” special variable to a directory name.  Only files
under that directory will be able to access the templates in that
file.

     </p>
<p>Any template file that has a project specified will get have a
priority that is set between SRecode base templates, and user defined
templates.

     </p>
<p>Templates can be compiled via a project system, such as EDE.  EDE
loaded templates will get a <var>project</var> set automatically.

     </p>
<p>Example:
     </p>
<pre class="example">          set project "/tmp/testproject"
     </pre>
     </dd>

   <p>If you need to insert the characters that belong to the variables

<h3 class="section">5.2 Templates</h3>

<p>A template represents a text pattern that can be inserted into
a buffer.

   </p>
<p>A basic template is declared like this:

</p>
<pre class="example">     template TEMPLATENAME :arg1 :arg2
     "Optional documentation string"
     ----
     The text to your template goes here.
     ----
     bind "a"
</pre>
   <p>Templates are stored in a template table by name, and are inserted by
the <var>templatename</var> provided.

   </p>
<p>The documentation string is optional.  This documentation string will
be used to aid users in selecting which template they want to use.

   </p>
<p>The code that makes up the raw template occurs between the lines that
contain the text "——".

</p>

</li>
</ul>

<pagebreak></pagebreak><div class="node"><a name="Template-Section-Dictionaries"></a></div>

<h4 class="subsection">5.2.1 Template Section Dictionaries</h4>

<p>To add variable values to section dictionaries used within a specific
template, you can add them to the beginning of the template
declaration like this:

</p>
<pre class="example">     template TEMPLATENAME :arg1 :arg2
     "Optional documentation string"
     sectiondictionary "A"
     set NAME "foo"
     ----
     A beginning line {{NAME}}
     {{#A}}Optional string {{NAME}} here{{/A}}
     An end line
     ----
</pre>
   <p>In this example, the <var>NAME</var> variable gets the value “foo”, but
only while it is inside section macro A.  The outer scoped NAME will
be empty.

   </p>
<p>This is particularly useful while using an include macro to pull in a
second template.  In this way, you can pass values known from one
template to a subordinate template where some value is not known.

   </p>
<p>From the Emacs Lisp default template file, a syntax table is just a
variable with a specialized value.

   </p>
<p>If a variable is declared like this (where $ is the escape character):

</p>
<pre class="example">     template variable :el
     "Insert a variable.
     DOC is optional."
     ----
     (defvar $?NAME$ $^$
       "$DOC$")
     ----
</pre>
   <p>then you can see that there is a NAME and DOC that is needed. 
The <code>^</code> point inserter is also a handy key here.

   </p>
<p>The syntax table wants a variable, but knows the values of some of
these variables, and can recast the problem like this by using
template specific <code>sectiondictionary</code> macro declarations.

</p>
<pre class="example">     template syntax-table
     "Create a syntax table."
     sectiondictionary "A"
     set NAME macro "?MODESYM" "-mode-syntax-table"
     set DOC "Syntax table used in " macro "?MODESYM" " buffers."
     ----
     $&lt;A:variable$
       (let ((table (make-syntax-table (standard-syntax-table))))
         (modify-syntax-entry ?\; ". 12"  table) ;; SEMI, Comment start ;;
         ;; ...
         table)
     $/A$
     ----
</pre>
   <p>In this way, <var>NAME</var> can be set as a user posed question for
<var>MODESYM</var> with “-mode-syntax-table” appended.  A simplified doc
string will also be inserted.

   </p>
<p>Lastly, the <var>A</var> section contains more macro text which is inserted
at the <code>^</code> point marker.

   </p>
<p>By creating useful base templates for things like function or variable
declarations, and recycling them in higher-order templates, an end
user can override the basic declarator, and the higher order templates
will then obey the new format, or perhaps even work in more than one
major mode.

</p>
<pagebreak></pagebreak><div class="node"><a name="Template-Macros"></a></div>

<h4 class="subsection">5.2.2 Template Macros</h4>

<p>Template macros occur in the template text.  The default escape
characters are “{{“ and “}}”, though they can be changed
in the top-level variables.  See <a href="#Variables">Variables</a>.

   </p>
<p>Thus, if you have the template code that looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="example">     ;; Author: {{AUTHOR}}
</pre>
   <p>Then the text between {{ and }} are a macro, and substituted by
the value of the variable <var>AUTHOR</var>.

   </p>
<p>Macros can be specialized to be more than just a text string.  For
example, the macro above could be augmented with an Emacs Lisp
function.

</p>
<pre class="example">     ;; Author: {{AUTHOR:upcase}}
</pre>
   <p>In this case, the Emacs Lisp function <code>upcase</code> will be called on
the text value of the <var>AUTHOR</var> variable.

   </p>
<p>Macros can also be specialized to have different behaviors by using a
prefix, non-alpha character or symbol.  For example:

</p>
<pre class="example">     {{! This is a comment inside macro escape characters }}
</pre>
   <p>shows that the “!” symbol is for comments.

   </p>
<p>Alternately, a macro could query the user during insertion:

</p>
<pre class="example">     (defun {{?NAME}} ()
        {{^}}
        ) ;; End of {{NAME}}
</pre>
   <p>the “?” symbol indicates that if the symbol <var>NAME</var> isn't in the
dictionary, then the user should be queried for the <var>NAME</var>
variable.  If <var>NAME</var> appears again in the template, the original
value specified by the user will be inserted again.

   </p>
<p>If the text from a dictionary value is to be placed in column format,
you can use the “|” symbol to indicate you want column control.  For
example:

</p>
<pre class="example">        | this | that |{{#A}}
        | {{|THIS:4}} | {{|THAT:4}} |{{/A}}
</pre>
   <p>For each repeated section “#A” the dictionary values for <var>THIS</var>
and <var>THAT</var> will be inserted and either trimmed to, or expanded to
4 characters in width.

   </p>
<p>Macros that are prefixed with the “#” symbol denote a section.  A
macro of the same name with a “/” prefix denotes the end of that
section.

</p>
<pre class="example">     {{#MOOSE}}
     Here is some text describing moose.
     {{/MOOSE}}
</pre>
   <p>In this example if the section MOOSE was “shown” in the active
dictionary, then the text between the # and / macros will also be
inserted.

   </p>
<p>All the text and macros within a section are either not shown at all
(if that section is not 'visible') or the section is shown one time
for each dictionary added to that symbol. 
See <a href="#Developing-Template-Functions">Developing Template Functions</a>.

   </p>
<p>Macros prefixed with “&gt;” will include another template.  Include
macros would look like this:

</p>
<pre class="example">     {{&gt;FOO:defun}}
</pre>
   <p>where <code>FOO</code> is the dictionary variable for the sub-dictionary used for
expanding the template <code>defun</code>.  The <code>defun</code> template will
be looked up in the template repository for the current mode, or in
any inherited modes.

   </p>
<p>Another way to include another template is with an include macro that
will also wrap section text.  The includewrap insertion method looks
like this:

</p>
<pre class="example">     {{&lt;FOO:defun}}Handy Text goes here{{/FOO}}
</pre>
   <p>In this case, <code>defun</code> is included just as above.  If the
<code>defun</code> template has a {{^}} macro in it, then the
section text “Handy Text goes here” will be inserted at that point,
and that location will not be saved as the cursor location.

   </p>
<p>If there is no {{^}}, then the text will not be inserted.

   </p>
<p>For both kinds of include macros, you may need to include a template
from a different context.  You can use <code>:</code> separate the context
from the name, like this:

</p>
<pre class="example">     {{&gt;FOO:declaration:function}}
</pre>
   <pagebreak></pagebreak><div class="node"><a name="Contexts"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">5.3 Context</h3>

<p>Each template belongs to a context.  When prompting for a template by
name, such as with <kbd>C-c / /</kbd>, the name is prefixed by the current
context.  If there is no context, it defaults to <code>declaration</code>.

   </p>
<p>You can change context like this:

</p>
<pre class="example">     context NAME
</pre>
   <p>where <var>name</var> is some symbol that represents any context.

   </p>
<p>A context resides over all templates that come after it until the next
context statement.  Thus:

</p>
<pre class="example">     context C1
     
     template foo
     "Foo template in C1"
     ----
     ----
     
     context C2
     
     template foo
     "Foo template in C2"
     ----
     ----
</pre>
   <p>creates two <code>foo</code> templates.  The first one is when in context
C1.  The second is available in context C2.

   </p>
<p>This is useful if there are multiple ways to declare something like a
function or variable that differ only by where it is in the syntax of
the language.  The name <code>foo</code> is not ambiguous because each is in
a different context.

</p>
<pagebreak></pagebreak><div class="node"><a name="Prompts"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">5.4 Prompt</h3>

<p>Some templates use prompting macro insertion.  A macro that needs a
prompt looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="example">     {{?NAME}}
</pre>
   <p>where ? comes after the first escape character.

   </p>
<p>by default, it will use a prompt like this when it is encountered:

</p>
<pre class="example">     Specify NAME:
</pre>
   <p>For such macros, you can pre-define prompts for any dictionary entry. 
When that dictionary entry is first encountered, the user is prompted,
and subsequent occurrences of that dictionary entry use the same value.

   </p>
<p>To get a different prompt, use a prompt command like this:

</p>
<pre class="example">     prompt VARNAME "Nice Way to ask for VARNAME: "
</pre>
   <p>Now, if you put this in a template:

</p>
<pre class="example">     template variable
     ----
     (defvar {{?VARNAME}} nil
        "")
     ----
</pre>
   <p>when VARNAME is encountered, it will use the nice prompt.

   </p>
<p>Prompts can be extended as well.  For example:

</p>
<pre class="example">     prompt VARNAME "VARNAME: " default "srecode" read y-or-n-p
</pre>
   <p>In this case, the <code>default</code> keyword indicates that
<code>"srecode"</code> is the default string to use, and <code>y-or-n-p</code> is
the function to use to ask the question.

   </p>
<p>For <code>y-or-n-p</code> if you type “y” it inserts the default string,
otherwise it inserts empty.

   </p>
<p>For any other symbol that occurs after the <code>read</code> token, it is
expected to take the same argument list as <code>read-string</code>.  As
such, you can create your own prompts that do completing reads on
deterministic values.

   </p>
<p>To have the default be calculated later from a dictionary entry, you
need to use the <code>defaultmacro</code> keyword instead.

</p>
<pre class="example">     prompt VARNAME "Varname: " defaultmacro "PREFIX"
</pre>
   <p>now, when it attempts to read in VARNAME, it will pre-populate the text
editing section with whatever the value of PREFIX is.

   </p>
<p>Some language arguments may supply possible prefixes for prompts. 
Look for these when creating your prompts.

<h2 class="chapter">6 Dictionaries</h2>

<p>Dictionaries are a set of variables.  The values associated with the

<h3 class="section">6.2 Setting Dictionary Values</h3>

<p>When building an <i>SRecode</i> based application, you will need to setup
your dictionary values yourself.  There are several utility functions
for this.

   </p>
<p>In the simplest form, you can associate a string with a variable.

</p>
<div class="defun">
— Function: <b>srecode-dictionary-set-value</b><var> dict name value<a name="index-srecode_002ddictionary_002dset_002dvalue-6"></a></var><br>

In dictionary <var>dict</var>, set <var>name</var> to have <var>value</var>. 
</p></blockquote>
</div>

   <p>For section macros, you can have alternate values.  A section can
either be toggled as visible, or it can act as a loop.

</p>
<div class="defun">
— Function: <b>srecode-dictionary-show-section</b><var> dict name<a name="index-srecode_002ddictionary_002dshow_002dsection-7"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="srecode_002ddictionary_002dshow_002dsection"></a>
In dictionary <var>dict</var>, indicate that the section <var>name</var> should be exposed. 
</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div class="defun">

<blockquote>
<p><a name="srecode_002ddictionary_002dadd_002dsection_002ddictionary"></a>
In dictionary <var>DICT</var>, add a section dictionary for section macro <var>NAME</var>. 
Return the new dictionary.

        </p>
<p>You can add several dictionaries to the same section entry. 
For each dictionary added to a variable, the block of codes in
the template will be repeated.

        </p>
<p>If optional argument <var>SHOW-ONLY</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, then don't add
a new dictionary if there is already one in place.  Also, don't add
<var>FIRST</var>/<var>LAST</var> entries. 
These entries are not needed when we are just showing a section.

        </p>
<p>Each dictionary added will automatically get values for positional macros
which will enable <var>SECTIONS</var> to be enabled.

          </p>
<dl>
<dt><var>first</var></dt>
<dd>The first entry in the table. 
<br>
</dd>

<br>
</dd>
<dt><var>notlast</var></dt>
<dd>Not the last entry in the table. 
</dd>
</dl>

        <p>Adding a new dictionary will alter these values in previously
inserted dictionaries. 
</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<pagebreak></pagebreak><div class="node"><a name="Compound-Dictionary-Values"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">6.3 Compound Dictionary Values</h3>

<p>If you want to associate a non-string value with a dictionary
variable, then you will need to use a compound value.  Compound
dictionary values are derived using <i>EIEIO</i> from a base class for
handling arbitrary data in a macro.

</p>
<div class="defun">
— Type: <b>srecode-dictionary-compound-value</b><var><a name="index-srecode_002ddictionary_002dcompound_002dvalue-9"></a></var><br>
<blockquote>
<p><a name="srecode_002ddictionary_002dcompound_002dvalue"></a>
A compound dictionary value. 
Values stored in a dictionary must be a <var>string</var>,
a dictionary for showing sections, or an instance of a subclass
of this class.

        </p>
<p>Compound dictionary values derive from this class, and must
provide a sequence of method implementations to convert into
a string. 
</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

   <p>Your new subclass of the compound value needs to implement these
methods:

</p>
<div class="defun">
— Function: <b>srecode-compound-toString</b><var> cp function dictionary<a name="index-srecode_002dcompound_002dtoString-10"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="srecode_002dcompound_002dtoString"></a>
Convert the compound dictionary value <var>cp</var> to a string. 
If <var>function</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, then <var>function</var> is somehow applied to an aspect
of the compound value.  The <var>function</var> could be a fraction
of some function symbol with a logical prefix excluded. 
</p></blockquote>
</div>

   <p>The next method is for dumping out tables during debugging.

</p>
<div class="defun">
— Function: <b>srecode-dump</b><var> cp &amp;optional indent<a name="index-srecode_002ddump-11"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="srecode_002ddump"></a>
Display information about this compound value. 
</p></blockquote>
</div>

   <p>Here is an example of wrapping a semantic tag in a compound value:

</p>
<pre class="example">     (defclass srecode-semantic-tag (srecode-dictionary-compound-value)
       ((prime :initarg :prime
               :type semantic-tag
               :documentation
               "This is the primary insertion tag.")
        )
       "Wrap up a collection of semantic tag information.
     This class will be used to derive dictionary values.")
     
     (defmethod srecode-compound-toString((cp srecode-semantic-tag)

                                          dictionary)
       "Convert the compound dictionary value CP to a string.
     If FUNCTION is non-nil, then FUNCTION is somehow applied to an
     aspect of the compound value."
       (if (not function)
           ;; Just format it in some handy dandy way.
           (semantic-format-tag-prototype (oref cp :prime))
         ;; Otherwise, apply the function to the tag itself.
         (funcall function (oref cp :prime))
         ))
</pre>
   <pagebreak></pagebreak><div class="node"><a name="Argument-Resolution"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">6.4 Argument Resolution</h3>

<p>Some dictionary entries can be set via template arguments in the
template declaration.  For examples of template arguments, see
<a href="#Template-Argument-Dictionary-Entries">Template Argument Dictionary Entries</a>.

   </p>
<p>You can resolve an argument list into a dictionary with:

</p>
<div class="defun">
— Function: <b>srecode-resolve-arguments</b><var> temp dict<a name="index-srecode_002dresolve_002darguments-12"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="srecode_002dresolve_002darguments"></a>
Resolve all the arguments needed by the template <var>temp</var>. 
Apply anything learned to the dictionary <var>dict</var>. 
</p></blockquote>
</div>

<pagebreak></pagebreak><div class="node"><a name="Creating-new-Arguments"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">6.5 Creating new Arguments</h3>

<p>You can create new arguments for use in template files by writing new
Emacs Lisp functions.  Doing so is easy.  Here is an example for the
<code>:user</code> argument:

</p>
<pre class="example">     (defun srecode-semantic-handle-:user (dict)
       "Add macros into the dictionary DICT based on the current :user."
       (srecode-dictionary-set-value dict "AUTHOR" (user-full-name))
       (srecode-dictionary-set-value dict "LOGIN" (user-login-name))
        ;; ...
       )
</pre>
   <p>In this case, a function with the name prefix
<code>srecode-semantic-handle-</code> that ends in <code>:user</code> creates a
new argument <code>:user</code> that can be used in a template.

   </p>
<p>Your argument handler must take one argument <var>dict</var>, which is the
dictionary to fill in.  Inside your function, you can do whatever you
want, but adding dictionary values is the right thing.

</p>
<pagebreak></pagebreak><div class="node"><a name="Querying-a-Dictionary"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">6.6 Querying a Dictionary</h3>

<p>When creating a new argument, it may be useful to ask the dictionary
what entries are already set there, and conditionally create new
entries based on those.

   </p>
<p>In this way, a template author can get additional logic through more
advanced arguments.

</p>
<div class="defun">

<h3 class="section">6.7 Template Argument Dictionary Entries</h3>

<p>When a dictionary is initialized for a template, then the dictionary

<h4 class="subsection">6.7.1 Base Arguments</h4>

<h5 class="subsubsection">6.7.1.1 Argument :indent</h5>

<p>Supplies the <code>INDENT</code> macro.  When <code>INDENT</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, then
each line is individually indented with
<code>indent-according-to-mode</code> during macro processing.

</p>
<h5 class="subsubsection">6.7.1.2 Argument :blank</h5>

<p>Specifying this argument adds a special <code>:blank</code> handler at the
beginning and end of the template.  This handler will insert <code>\n</code>
if the insertion point is not on a line by itself.

</p>
<h5 class="subsubsection">6.7.1.3 Argument :region</h5>

<p>If there is an active region via <code>transient-mark-mode</code>, or
<code>mouse-drag-region</code>, then the <code>REGION</code> section will be
enabled.

   </p>
<p>In addition, <code>REGIONTEXT</code> will be set to the text in the region,
and that region of text will be “killed” from the current buffer.

   </p>
<p>If standard-output is NOT the current buffer, then the region will not
be deleted.  In this way, you can safely use <code>:region</code> using
templates in arbitrary output streams.

</p>
<h5 class="subsubsection">6.7.1.4 Argument :user</h5>

<p>Sets up variables about the current user.

<h5 class="subsubsection">6.7.2.1 Argument :tag</h5>

<p>The :tag argument is filled in with information from Semantic. 
The tag in question is queried from the senator tag ring, or passed
in from <i>SRecode</i> utilities that use tags in templates.

     </p>
<dl>
<dt><code>TAG</code></dt>
<dd>This is a compound value for the tag in the current senator kill ring,
or something handled via the variable
<code>srecode-semantic-selected-tag</code>.

<dt><code>NAME</code></dt>
<dd>The name of the tag as a string. 
<br>
</dd>
<dt><code>TYPE</code></dt>
<dd>The data type of the tag as a string. 
</dd>
</dl>

   <p>If <var>tag</var> is a function, you will get these additional dictionary
entries.

     </p>
<dl>
<dt><code>ARGS</code></dt>
<dd>A Loop macro value.  Each argument is inserted in ARGS.  To create a
comma separated list of arguments, you might do this:

     <pre class="example">          {{#ARGS}}{{TYPE}} {{NAME}}{{#NOTLAST}},{{/NOTLAST}}{{/ARGS}}
     </pre>
     <p>Within the section dictionaries for each argument, you will find both
<var>NAME</var> and <var>TYPE</var>, in addition to the automatic section values
for <var>FIRST</var>, <var>LAST</var>, <var>NOTFIRST</var>, and <var>NOTLAST</var>. 
<br></p>
</dd>
<dt><code>PARENT</code></dt>

     </p>
<dl>
<dt><code>DEFAULTVALUE</code></dt>
<dd>Enabled if there is a <var>VALUE</var>. 
<br>
</dd>
<dt><code>VALUE</code></dt>
<dd>An entry in the <var>HAVEDEFAULT</var> subdictionary that represents the

     </p>
<dl>
<dt><code>PARENTS</code></dt>
<dd>Section dictionaries for the parents of this class.  Each parent will
have a <var>NAME</var>. 
<br>
</dd>
<dt><code>INTERFACES</code></dt>
<dd>Section dictionaries for all the implemented interfaces of this
class.  Each interface will have a <var>NAME</var>. 
</dd>
</dl>

   <p>Note that data type templates should always have a <code>{{^}}</code>
macro in it where the core contents of that type will go.  This is why
data types don't have subdictionaries full of the slots in the classes
or structs.

<h2 class="chapter">7 Developing Template Functions</h2>

<p>You can develop your own custom template insertion functions. 
Doing so is relatively simple, and requires that you write an Emacs
Lisp command.

   </p>
<p>If the built in commands don't provide enough options, you will need
to write your own function in order to provide your dictionaries with
the values needed for custom templates.

   </p>
<p>In this way, you can build your own code generator for any language
based on a set of predefined macros whos values you need to derive
from Emacs Lisp code yourself.

   </p>
<p>For example:

</p>
<pre class="example">     (defun my-srecode-insert (template-name)
       "Insert the template TEMPLATE-NAME into the current buffer at point."
     
       ;; Read in a template name.
       (interactive (list (srecode-read-template-name "Template Name: ")))
       (if (not (srecode-table))
           (error "No template table found for mode %s" major-mode))
       (let ((temp (srecode-template-get-table (srecode-table) template-name))
     
            ;; Create a new dictionary
     	(newdict (srecode-create-dictionary)))
     
         (if (not temp)
             (error "No Template named %s" template-name))
     
         ;; Add some values into the dictionary!
         (srecode-dictionary-set-value newdict "FOO" (my-get-value-of-foo))
         ;; Optionally show a section
         (srecode-dictionary-show-section newdict "BLARG")
     
         ;; Add in several items over a loop
         (let ((my-stuff (get-my-stuff-list)))
            (while my-stuff
               (let ((subdict (srecode-dictionary-add-section-dictionary
                                  newdict "LOOP")))
                  (srecode-dictionary-set-value subdict "NAME" (nth 0 my-stuff))
                  (srecode-dictionary-set-value subdict "ARG" (nth 1 my-stuff))
                  (srecode-dictionary-set-value subdict "MOOSE" (nth 2 my-stuff))
                  )
               (setq my-stuff (cdr my-stuff)))
     
         ;; Some templates have arguments that need to be resolved.
         (srecode-resolve-arguments temp newdict)
     
         ;; Do the expansion
         (srecode-insert-fcn temp newdict)
         ))
</pre>
   <p>Lets look at the key functions involved above:

</p>
<h3 class="section">7.1 Interactive Completion:</h3>

<div class="defun">
— Function: <b>srecode-read-template-name</b><var> prompt<a name="index-srecode_002dread_002dtemplate_002dname-15"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="srecode_002dread_002dtemplate_002dname"></a>
Completing read for Semantic Recoder template names. 
<var>prompt</var> is used to query for the name of the template desired. 
</p></blockquote>
</div>

<h3 class="section">7.2 Template Lookup</h3>

<p>Even if your program does not query the user for a template name, you
will need to locate a template.  First, you need to locate the table
to look the template up in.

</p>
<div class="defun">
— Function: <b>srecode-table</b><var> &amp;optional mode<a name="index-srecode_002dtable-16"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="srecode_002dtable"></a>
Return the currently active Semantic Recoder table for this buffer. 
Optional argument <var>MODE</var> specifies the mode table to use. 
</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div class="defun">
— Function: <b>srecode-template-get-table</b><var> tab template-name &amp;optional context application<a name="index-srecode_002dtemplate_002dget_002dtable-17"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="srecode_002dtemplate_002dget_002dtable"></a>
Find in the template in mode table <var>TAB</var>, the template with <var>TEMPLATE-NAME</var>. 
Optional argument <var>CONTEXT</var> specifies a context a particular template
would belong to. 
Optional argument <var>APPLICATION</var> restricts searches to only template tables
belonging to a specific application.  If <var>APPLICATION</var> is <code>nil</code>, then only
tables that do not belong to an application will be searched. 
</p></blockquote>
</div>

   <p>For purposes of an <i>SRecode</i> application, it is important to decide
what to call your application, and use that with this method call.

</p>
<h3 class="section">7.3 Creating dictionaries</h3>

<p>Several dictionary calls are made in this example, including:
     </p>
<dl>
<dt>
<code>srecode-create-dictionary</code><br><dt>
<code>srecode-dictionary-set-value</code><br><dt>
<code>srecode-dictionary-show-section</code><br><dt><code>srecode-dictionary-add-section-dictionary</code></dt>
</dt>

<p>Also used is <code>srecode-resolve-arguments</code>.  To learn more about
that, see <a href="#Argument-Resolution">Argument Resolution</a>.

</p>
<h3 class="section">7.4 Template Insertion Commands</h3>

<p>There are several ways to insert a template.  It is easiest to just
start with the main entry point.

</div>

<pagebreak></pagebreak><div class="node"><a name="Template-Naming-Conventions"></a></div>

<h2 class="chapter">8 Template Naming Conventions</h2>

<p>For <i>SRecode</i> to work across languages reliably, templates need to
follow a predictable pattern.  For every language of similar nature
(OO, functional, doc based) if they all provide the same base
templates, then an application can be written against the base
templates, and it will work in each of the supported language.

   </p>
<p>Having consistent templates also makes it easy to use those templates
from a user perspective during basic interactive insertion via
<code>srecode-minor-mode</code>.

   </p>
<p>NOTES ON THIS CHAPTER:

   </p>
<p>These conventions are being worked on.  Check w/ CEDET-DEVEL mailing
list if you want to support a language, or write an application and
provide your opinions on this topic.  Any help is appreciated.

</p>
<h3 class="section">8.1 Context: File</h3>

<p>Each language should support the <code>file:empty</code> template.  This
will generally use the default copyright insertion mechanism.

</p>
<h3 class="section">8.2 Context: Declaration</h3>

<p>Functional languages should attempt to support the following:

     </p>
<dl>
<dt><code>function</code></dt>
<dd>A standalone function.  Not a method, external method, or other. 
<br>
</dd>
<dt><code>method</code></dt>
<dd>A method belonging to some class declared outside the textual bounds
of that class' declaration. 
<br>
</dd>
<dt><code>variable</code></dt>
<dd>A global variable. 
<br>
</dd>
<dt><code>type</code></dt>
<dd>A data type.  If the language supports several types of datatypes
then do not use this, use more specific ones instead. 
<br>
</dd>
<dt><code>class</code></dt>
<dd>For OO languages, use this instead of <code>type</code>. 
<br>
</dd>
<dt><code>include</code></dt>
<dd>Include files. 
</dd>
</dl>

   <p>For any <i>Semantic</i> tag class in your language, you will likely want
to have a corresponding template.

   </p>
<p>In order for the <i>SRecode</i> function
<code>srecode-semantic-insert-tag</code> to work, you can create templates
similar to those mentioned above, except with <code>-tag</code> appended to
the end.  This lets a template like <code>function</code> have user
conveniences when referencing <code>function-tag</code>, while also
allowing the tag inserter to do its job with a simpler template.

</p>
<h3 class="section">8.3 Context: Classdef</h3>

<p>Inside a class definition.  These are to be inserted inside the
textual bounds of a class declaration.

     </p>
<dl>
<dt><code>function</code></dt>
<dd>This would be a method of the class being inserted into. 
<br>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>constructor</code><dt><code>destructor</code></dt>
</dt>
<dd>Like <code>function</code> but specific to alloc/delete of an object. 
<br>
</dd>
<dt><code>variable</code></dt>
<dd>This would be a field of the class being inserted into. 
</dd>
</dl>

<h3 class="section">8.4 Context: Code</h3>

<p>Inside a body of code, such as a function or method body.

   </p>
<p>—no conventions yet.

</p>
<h3 class="section">8.5 Standard Dictionary Values</h3>

<p>For these variables to be useful, standard names should be used. 
These values could be provided directly from a Semantic tag, or by an
application.

     </p>
<dl>
<dt><var>NAME</var></dt>
<dd>The name of the declaration being created. 
<br>
</dd>
<dt><var>PARENT</var></dt>
<dd>If the item belongs to some parent type, it would be the full name of
that type, including namespaces. 
<br>
</dd>
<dt><var>TYPE</var></dt>
<dd>A datatype name for a variable, or the return value of a function. 
<br>
</dd>
<dt><var>DOC</var></dt>
<dd>If there is some documentation associated with the item, then DOC
should contain the value.  (Optional)
<br>
</dd>
<dt><var>ARGS</var></dt>
<dd>The ARGS variable defines a section for 0 or more arguments to a function
or method.  Each entry in ARGS will follow the rest of these naming
conventions, such as for NAME and TYPE. 
</dd>
</dl>

   <p>For templates used by <code>srecode-semantic-insert-tag</code>, there is
also the following useful dictionary values.

     </p>
<dl>
<dt><var>TAG</var></dt>
<dd>A special insertion value TAG.  You can use semantic functions to turn
the tag into a string. 
<br>
</dd>
<dt>
<var>HAVEDEFAULT</var><dt><var>DEFAULT</var></dt>
</dt>
<dd>Default value for a variable. 
</dd>
</dl>

<pagebreak></pagebreak><div class="node"><a name="Inserting-Tag-Lists"></a></div>

<h2 class="chapter">9 Inserting Tag Lists</h2>

<p>Since <i>SRecode</i> is the <i>Semantic Recoder</i>, the ultimate goal for
<i>SRecode</i> is to convert lists of tags, as produced by <i>Semantic</i>
back into code.

   </p>
<p>A single function provides the interface for programs to do this, but
it requires any particular language to have provided the correct
templates to make it work.

</p>
<div class="defun">
— Function: <b>srecode-semantic-insert-tag</b><var> tag &amp;optional style-option point-insert-fcn &amp;rest dict-entries<a name="index-srecode_002dsemantic_002dinsert_002dtag-19"></a></var><br>
<blockquote>
<p><a name="srecode_002dsemantic_002dinsert_002dtag"></a>
Insert <var>tag</var> into a buffer using srecode templates at point.

        </p>
<p>Optional <var>style-option</var> is a list of minor configuration of styles,
such as the symbol <code>'prototype</code> for prototype functions, or
<code>'system</code> for system includes, and <code>'doxygen</code>, for a doxygen style
comment.

        </p>
<p>Optional third argument <var>point-insert-fcn</var> is a hook that is run after
<var>tag</var> is inserted that allows an opportunity to fill in the body of
some thing.  This hook function is called with one argument, the <var>tag</var>
being inserted.

        </p>
<p>The rest of the arguments are <var>dict-entries</var>.  <var>dict-entries</var>
is of the form ( <var>name1</var> <var>value1</var> <var>name2</var> <var>value2</var> <small class="dots">...</small> NAMEn VALUEn).

        </p>
<p>The exact template used is based on the current context. 
The template used is found within the toplevel context as calculated
by <dfn>srecode-calculate-context</dfn>, such as <code>declaration</code>, <code>classdecl</code>,
or <code>code</code>.

        </p>
<p>For various conditions, this function looks for a template with
the name <var>class</var>-tag, where <var>class</var> is the tag class.  If it cannot
find that, it will look for that template in the
<code>declaration</code>context (if the current context was not <code>declaration</code>).

        </p>
<p>If <var>prototype</var> is specified, it will first look for templates with
the name <var>class</var>-tag-prototype, or <var>class</var>-prototype as above.

        </p>
<p>See <dfn>srecode-semantic-apply-tag-to-dict</dfn> for details on what is in
the dictionary when the templates are called.

        </p>
<p>This function returns to location in the buffer where the
inserted tag <var>ends</var>, and will leave point inside the inserted
text based on any occurrence of a point-inserter.  Templates such
as <dfn>function</dfn> will leave point where code might be inserted.

<h2 class="chapter">10 Application Writing</h2>

<p>The main goal of <i>SRecode</i> is to provide a strong platform for
writing code generating applications.

   </p>
<p>Any templates that are application specific should make an application
declaration for each template file they use.  This prevents those
templates from being used outside of that application.

   </p>
<p>For example, add this to a file:
</p>
<pre class="example">     set application "getset"
</pre>
   <p>In your application Emacs Lisp code, you would then load those
templates.  A typical initialization would look like this:

</p>
<pre class="example">       (srecode-load-tables-for-mode major-mode)
       (srecode-load-tables-for-mode major-mode 'getset)
</pre>
   <p>These two lines will load in the base templates for the major mode,
and then the application specific templates.

</p>
<div class="defun">
— Function: <b>srecode-load-tables-for-mode</b><var> mmode &amp;optional appname<a name="index-srecode_002dload_002dtables_002dfor_002dmode-20"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="srecode_002dload_002dtables_002dfor_002dmode"></a>
Load all the template files for <var>mmode</var>. 
Templates are found in the SRecode Template Map. 
See <dfn>srecode-get-maps</dfn> for more. 
<var>appname</var> is the name of an application.  In this case,
all template files for that application will be loaded. 
</p></blockquote>

   <p>todo: Add examples.  Most core stuff is already described above.

<pre class="display">     Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <a href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a>
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>
     <ol type="1" start="0">
<li>PREAMBLE

     <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <dfn>free</dfn> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. 
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

     </p>
<p>This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

     </p>
<p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

     </p>
</li>
<li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     <p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The “Document”, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as “you”.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

     </p>
<p>A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

     </p>
<p>A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

     </p>
<p>The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

     </p>
<p>The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

     </p>
<p>A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. 
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

     </p>
<p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, SGML or XML using a publicly available
DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and
JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

     </p>
<p>The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title Page” means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     </p>
<p>The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.

     </p>
<p>A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as “Acknowledgements”,
“Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)  To “Preserve the Title”
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section “Entitled XYZ” according to this definition.

     </p>
<p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

     </p>
</li>
<li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     </p>
<p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     </p>
</li>
<li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     </p>
<p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     </p>
<p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. 
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

     </p>
<p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     </p>
</li>
<li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

          </p>
<ol type="A" start="1">
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

          </li>
<li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

          </li>
<li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

          </li>
<li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

          </li>
<li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

          </li>
<li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

          </li>
<li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

          </li>
<li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

          </li>
<li>Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled “History” in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

          </li>
<li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the “History” section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

          </li>
<li>For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

          </li>
<li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

          </li>
<li>Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

          </li>
<li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled “Endorsements” or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

          </li>
<li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          </li>
</ol>

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     </p>
<p>You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     </p>
<p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     </p>
<p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     </p>
</li>
<li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

     </p>
<p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     </p>
<p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled “History”
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
“History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You must delete all
sections Entitled “Endorsements.”

     </p>
</li>
<li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     </p>
<p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     </p>
</li>
<li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. 
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

     </p>
<p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. 
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

     </p>
</li>
<li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     </p>
<p>If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
“Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

     </p>
</li>
<li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     </p>
<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

     </p>
<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

     </p>
<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

     </p>
</li>
<li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

     </p>
<p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

     </p>
</li>
<li>RELICENSING

     <p>“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.

     </p>
<p>“CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

     </p>
<p>“Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.

     </p>
<p>An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

     </p>
<p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

        </p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="heading">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">       Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the “with<small class="dots">...</small>Texts.” line with this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">         with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being <var>list</var>.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   </p>
<p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
