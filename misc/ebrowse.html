<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction</h2>

<p>When working in software projects using C++, I frequently missed
software support for two things:

     <ul>
<li>When you get a new class library, or you have to work on source code you
haven't written yourself (or written sufficiently long ago), you need a
tool to let you navigate class hierarchies and investigate
features of the software.  Without such a tool you often end up
<samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp>ing through dozens or even hundreds of files.

     <li>Once you are productive, it would be nice to have a tool that knows your
sources and can help you while you are editing source code.  Imagine to
be able to jump to the definition of an identifier while you are
editing, or something that can complete long identifier names because it
knows what identifiers are defined in your program<small class="dots">...</small>. 
</ul>

   <p>The design of Ebrowse reflects these two needs.

   <p>How does it work?

   <p><a name="index-parser-for-C_002b_002b-sources-1"></a>A fast parser written in C is used to process C++ source files. 
The parser generates a data base containing information about classes,
members, global functions, defines, types etc. found in the sources.

   <p>The second part of Ebrowse is a Lisp program.  This program reads
the data base generated by the parser.  It displays its contents in
various forms and allows you to perform operations on it, or do
something with the help of the knowledge contained in the data base.

   <p><a name="index-major-modes_002c-of-Ebrowse-buffers-2"></a><dfn>Navigational</dfn> use of Ebrowse is centered around two
types of buffers which define their own major modes:

   <p><a name="index-tree-buffer-3"></a><dfn>Tree buffers</dfn> are used to view class hierarchies in tree form. 
They allow you to quickly find classes, find or view class declarations,
perform operations like query replace on sets of your source files, and
finally tree buffers are used to produce the second buffer form&mdash;member
buffers.  See <a href="#Tree-Buffers">Tree Buffers</a>.

   <p><a name="index-member-buffer-4"></a>Members are displayed in <dfn>member buffers</dfn>.  Ebrowse
distinguishes between six different types of members; each type is
displayed as a member list of its own:

     <ul>
<li>Instance member variables;

     <li>Instance member functions;

     <li>Static member variables;

     <li>Static member functions;

     <li>Friends/Defines.  The list of defines is contained in the friends
list of the pseudo-class `<samp><span class="samp">*Globals*</span></samp>';

     <li>Types (<code>enum</code>s, and <code>typedef</code>s defined with class
scope). 
</ul>

   <p>You can switch member buffers from one list to another, or to another
class.  You can include inherited members in the display, you can set
filters that remove categories of members from the display, and most
importantly you can find or view member declarations and definitions
with a keystroke.  See <a href="#Member-Buffers">Member Buffers</a>.

   <p>These two buffer types and the commands they provide support the
navigational use of the browser.  The second form resembles Emacs's Tags
package for C and other procedural languages.  Ebrowse's commands of
this type are not confined to special buffers; they are most often used
while you are editing your source code.

   <p>To list just a subset of what you can use the Tags part of Ebrowse for:

     <ul>
<li>Jump to the definition or declaration of an identifier in your source
code, with an electric position stack that lets you easily navigate
back and forth.

     <li>Complete identifiers in your source with a completion list containing
identifiers from your source code only.

     <li>Perform search and query replace operations over some or all of your
source files.

     <li>Show all identifiers matching a regular expression&mdash;and jump to one of
them, if you like. 
</ul>

<h2 class="chapter">2 Processing Source Files</h2>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040command_007bebrowse_007d_002c-the-program-5"></a><a name="index-class-data-base-creation-6"></a>Before you can start browsing a class hierarchy, you must run the parser
<samp><span class="command">ebrowse</span></samp> on your source files in order to generate a Lisp data
base describing your program.

   <p><a name="index-command-line-for-_0040command_007bebrowse_007d-7"></a>The operation of <samp><span class="command">ebrowse</span></samp> can be tailored with command line
options.  Under normal circumstances it suffices to let the parser use
its default settings.  If you want to do that, call it with a command
line like:

<pre class="example">     ebrowse *.h *.cc
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">or, if your shell doesn't allow all the file names to be specified on
the command line,

<pre class="example">     ebrowse --files=<var>file</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where <var>file</var> contains the names of the files to be parsed, one
per line.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dhelp-8"></a>When invoked with option `<samp><span class="samp">--help</span></samp>', <samp><span class="command">ebrowse</span></samp> prints a list of
available command line options.

<h3 class="section">2.1 Specifying Input Files</h3>

<dl><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">file</span></samp>'<dd>Each file name on the command line tells <samp><span class="command">ebrowse</span></samp> to parse
that file.

     <p><a name="index-response-files-10"></a><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dfiles-11"></a><br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--files=</span><var>file</var></samp>'<dd>This command line switch specifies that <var>file</var> contains a list of
file names to parse.  Each line in <var>file</var> must contain one file
name.  More than one option of this kind is allowed.  You might, for
instance, want to use one file for header files, and another for source
files.

     <p><a name="index-standard-input_002c-specifying-input-files-12"></a><br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">standard input</span></samp>'<dd>When <samp><span class="command">ebrowse</span></samp> finds no file names on the command line, and no
`<samp><span class="samp">--file</span></samp>' option is specified, it reads file names from standard
input.  This is sometimes convenient when <samp><span class="command">ebrowse</span></samp> is used as part
of a command pipe.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dsearch_002dpath-13"></a><br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--search-path=</span><var>paths</var></samp>'<dd>This option lets you specify search paths for your input files. 
<var>paths</var> is a list of directory names, separated from each other by a
either a colon or a semicolon, depending on the operating system. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-header-files-14"></a><a name="index-friend-functions-15"></a>It is generally a good idea to specify input files so that header files
are parsed before source files.  This facilitates the parser's work of
properly identifying friend functions of a class.

<h3 class="section">2.4 Regular Expressions</h3>

<p><a name="index-regular-expressions_002c-recording-24"></a>The parser <samp><span class="command">ebrowse</span></samp> normally writes regular expressions to its
output file that help the Lisp part of Ebrowse to find functions,
variables etc. in their source files.

   <p>You can instruct <samp><span class="command">ebrowse</span></samp> to omit these regular expressions by
calling it with the command line switch `<samp><span class="samp">--no-regexps</span></samp>'.

   <p>When you do this, the Lisp part of Ebrowse tries to guess, from member
or class names, suitable regular expressions to locate that class or
member in source files.  This works fine in most cases, but the
automatic generation of regular expressions can be too weak if unusual
coding styles are used.

     
<a name="index-g_t_002d_002dno_002dregexps-25"></a>
<dl><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--no-regexps</span></samp>'<dd>This option turns off regular expression recording.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dmin_002dregexp_002dlength-26"></a><a name="index-minimum-regexp-length-for-recording-27"></a><br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--min-regexp-length=</span><var>n</var></samp>'<dd>The number <var>n</var> following this option specifies the minimum length of
the regular expressions recorded to match class and member declarations
and definitions.  The default value is set at compilation time of
<samp><span class="command">ebrowse</span></samp>.

     <p>The smaller the minimum length, the higher the probability that
Ebrowse will find a wrong match.  The larger the value, the
larger the output file and therefore the memory consumption once the
file is read from Emacs.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dmax_002dregexp_002dlength-28"></a><a name="index-maximum-regexp-length-for-recording-29"></a><br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--max-regexp-length=</span><var>n</var></samp>'<dd>The number following this option specifies the maximum length of the
regular expressions used to match class and member declarations and
definitions.  The default value is set at compilation time of

     <p>The larger the maximum length, the higher the probability that the
browser will find a correct match, but the larger the value the larger
the output file and therefore the memory consumption once the data is
read.  As a second effect, the larger the regular expression, the higher
the probability that it will no longer match after editing the file.

<h2 class="chapter">3 Starting to Browse</h2>

<p><a name="index-loading-33"></a><a name="index-browsing-34"></a>
You start browsing a class hierarchy parsed by <samp><span class="command">ebrowse</span></samp> by just
finding the <samp><span class="file">BROWSE</span></samp> file with <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>.

   <p>An example of a tree buffer display is shown below.

<pre class="example">     |  Collection
     |    IndexedCollection
     |      Array
     |        FixedArray
     |    Set
     |    Dictionary
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-mouse-highlight-in-tree-buffers-35"></a>When you run Emacs on a display which supports colors and the mouse, you
will notice that certain areas in the tree buffer are highlighted
when you move the mouse over them.  This highlight marks mouse-sensitive
regions in the buffer.  Please notice the help strings in the echo area
when the mouse moves over a sensitive region.

   <p><a name="index-context-menu-36"></a>A click with <kbd>Mouse-3</kbd> on a mouse-sensitive region opens a context
menu.  In addition to this, each buffer also has a buffer-specific menu
that is opened with a click with <kbd>Mouse-3</kbd> somewhere in the buffer
where no highlight is displayed.

major mode.  Most Emacs keys work in tree buffers in the usual way,
e.g., you can move around in the buffer with the usual <kbd>C-f</kbd>,
<kbd>C-v</kbd> etc., or you can search with <kbd>C-s</kbd>.

   <p>Tree-specific commands are bound to simple keystrokes, similar to
<code>Gnus</code>.  You can take a look at the key bindings by entering
<kbd>?</kbd> which calls <code>M-x describe-mode</code> in both tree and member
buffers.

<p><a name="index-viewing_002c-class-39"></a><a name="index-finding-a-class-40"></a><a name="index-class-declaration-41"></a>
You can view or find a class declaration when the cursor is on a class
name.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd><dd>This command views the class declaration if the database
contains information about it.  If you don't parse the entire source
you are working on, some classes will only be known to exist but the
location of their declarations and definitions will not be known.

     <br><dt><kbd>&lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Works like <kbd>SPC</kbd>, except that it finds the class
declaration rather than viewing it, so that it is ready for
editing. 
</dl>

   <p>The same functionality is available from the menu opened with
<kbd>Mouse-3</kbd> on the class name.

Ebrowse distinguishes six different kinds of members, each of
which is displayed as a separate <dfn>member list</dfn>: instance variables,
instance functions, static variables, static functions, friend
functions, and types.

   <p>Each of these lists can be displayed in a member buffer with a command
starting with <kbd>L</kbd> when the cursor is on a class name.  By default,
there is only one member buffer named <dfn>*Members*</dfn> that is reused
each time you display a member list&mdash;this has proven to be more
practical than to clutter up the buffer list with dozens of member
buffers.

   <p>If you want to display more than one member list at a time you can
<dfn>freeze</dfn> its member buffer. Freezing a member buffer prevents it
from being overwritten the next time you display a member list. You can
toggle this buffer status at any time.

   <p>Every member list display command in the tree buffer can be used with a
prefix argument (<kbd>C-u</kbd>).  Without a prefix argument, the command will
pop to a member buffer displaying the member list.  With prefix argument,
the member buffer will additionally be <dfn>frozen</dfn>.

     
<a name="index-instance-member-variables_002c-list-46"></a>
<dl><dt><kbd>L v</kbd><dd>This command displays the list of instance member variables.

     <p><a name="index-static-variables_002c-list-47"></a><br><dt><kbd>L V</kbd><dd>Display the list of static variables.

     <p><a name="index-friend-functions_002c-list-48"></a><br><dt><kbd>L d</kbd><dd>Display the list of friend functions.  This list is used for defines if
you are viewing the class `<samp><span class="samp">*Globals*</span></samp>' which is a place holder for
global symbols.

     <p><a name="index-member-functions_002c-list-49"></a><br><dt><kbd>L f</kbd><dd>Display the list of member functions.

     <p><a name="index-static-member-functions_002c-list-50"></a><br><dt><kbd>L F</kbd><dd>Display the list of static member functions.

     <p><a name="index-types_002c-list-51"></a><br><dt><kbd>L t</kbd><dd>Display a list of types.

<a name="index-class-members_002c-types-78"></a><a name="index-types-of-class-members-79"></a><dfn>Member buffers</dfn> are used to operate on lists of members of a class. 
Ebrowse distinguishes six kinds of lists:

     <ul>
<li>Instance variables (normal member variables);
<li>Instance functions (normal member functions);
<li>Static variables;
<li>Static member functions;
<li>Friend functions;
<li>Types (<code>enum</code>s and <code>typedef</code>s defined with class scope. 
Nested classes will be shown in the class tree like normal classes. 
</ul>

   <p>Like tree buffers, member buffers install their own major mode.  Also
like in tree buffers, menus are provided for certain areas in the
buffer: members, classes, and the buffer itself.

<h3 class="section">6.2 The Position Stack</h3>

<p><a name="index-position-stack-140"></a>
When jumping to a member declaration or definition with one of
Ebrowse's commands, the position from where you performed the
jump and the position where you jumped to are recorded in a
<dfn>position stack</dfn>.  There are several ways in which you can quickly
move to positions in the stack:

     
<a name="index-return-to-original-position-141"></a>
<dl><dt><kbd>C-c C-m -</kbd><dd>This command sets point to the previous position in the position stack. 
Directly after you performed a jump, this will put you back to the
position where you came from.

     <p>The stack is not popped, i.e., you can always switch back and forth
between positions in the stack.  To avoid letting the stack grow to
infinite size there is a maximum number of positions defined.  When this
number is reached, older positions are discarded when new positions are
pushed on the stack.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-m +</kbd><dd>This command moves forward in the position stack, setting point to
the next position stored in the position stack.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-m p</kbd><dd>Displays an electric buffer showing all positions saved in the stack. 
You can select a position by pressing <kbd>SPC</kbd> in a line.  You can
view a position with <kbd>v</kbd>.

Ebrowse allows you to perform operations on all or a subset of the files
mentioned in a class tree.  When you invoke one of the following
functions and more than one class tree is loaded, you must choose a
class tree to use from an electric tree menu.  If the selected tree
contains marked classes, the following commands operate on the files
mentioned in the marked classes only.  Otherwise all files in the class
tree are used.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-c C-m s</kbd><dd>This function performs a regular expression search in the chosen set of
files.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-m u</kbd><dd>This command performs a search for calls of a given member which is

given regular expression.  This command can be very useful if you
remember only part of a member name, and not its beginning.

   <p>A special buffer is popped up containing all identifiers matching the
regular expression, and what kind of symbol it is (e.g., a member
function, or a type).  You can then switch to this buffer, and use the
command <kbd>C-c C-m f</kbd>, for example, to jump to a specific member.

     <p>A &ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

     <p>A &ldquo;Secondary Section&rdquo; is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

     <p>The &ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

     <p>The &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

     <p>A &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. 
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.

     <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, SGML or XML using a publicly available
DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and
JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

     <p>The &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     <p>The &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.

     <p>A section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;.)  To &ldquo;Preserve the Title&rdquo;
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; according to this definition.

     <p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

     <li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     <li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. 
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

     <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     <li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

          <ol type=A start=1>
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

          <li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

          <li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

          <li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

          <li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

          <li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

          <li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

          <li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

          <li>Preserve the section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

          <li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

          <li>For any section Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

          <li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

          <li>Delete any section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

          <li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo; or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

          <li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          </ol>

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     <p>You may add a section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties&mdash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     <li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

     <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
and any sections Entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.  You must delete all
sections Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements.&rdquo;

     <li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     <li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. 
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

     <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. 
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

     <li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     <p>If a section in the Document is Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

     <li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

     <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

     <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

     <li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

     <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

     <li>RELICENSING

     <p>&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC Site&rdquo;) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC&rdquo;) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.

     <p>&ldquo;CC-BY-SA&rdquo; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

     <p>&ldquo;Incorporate&rdquo; means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.

     <p>An MMC is &ldquo;eligible for relicensing&rdquo; if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

     <p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

        </ol>

<h3 class="heading">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

<pre class="smallexample">       Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the &ldquo;with<small class="dots">...</small>Texts.&rdquo; line with this:

<pre class="smallexample">         with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being <var>list</var>.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   <p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
