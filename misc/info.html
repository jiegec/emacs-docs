<h2 class="unnumbered">Info: An Introduction</h2>

<p>The GNU Project distributes most of its manuals in the
<dfn>Info format</dfn>, which you read using an <dfn>Info reader</dfn>.  You are
probably using an Info reader to read this now.

   </p>
<p>There are two primary Info readers: <code>info</code>, a stand-alone program
designed just to read Info files (see <a href="info-stnd.html#Top">What is Info?</a>), and the <code>info</code> package in GNU Emacs, a
general-purpose editor.  At present, only the Emacs reader supports
using a mouse.

   </p>
<p>This file describes how to use Info, the menu-driven GNU
documentation system.

<h2 class="chapter">1 Getting Started</h2>

<p>This first part of this Info manual describes how to get around inside
of Info.  The second part of the manual describes various advanced
Info commands.  The third part contains references to other sources,
which explain how to generate Info files from Texinfo files.

   </p>
<p>This manual is primarily designed for browsing with an Info reader
program on a computer, so that you can try Info commands while reading
about them.  Reading it on paper or with an HTML browser is less
effective, since you must take it on faith that the commands described
really do what the manual says.  By all means go through this manual
now that you have it; but please try going through the Info version
as well.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-Info-reader_002c-how-to-invoke-1"></a><a name="index-entering-Info-2"></a>There are two ways of looking at the online version of this manual:

     </p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Type <code>info</code> at your shell's command line.  This approach uses a
stand-alone program designed just to read Info files.

     </li>
<li>Type <code>emacs</code> at the command line; then type <kbd>C-h i</kbd>
(<kbd>Control-h</kbd>, followed by <kbd>i</kbd>).  This approach uses the Info
mode of the Emacs editor.
        </li>
</ol>

   <p>In either case, then type <kbd>mInfo</kbd> (just the letters), followed by
&lt;RET&gt;—the “Return” or “Enter” key.  At this point, you should
be ready to follow the instructions in this manual as you read them on
the screen. 
<!-- FIXME! (pesch@cygnus.com, 14 dec 1992) -->
<!-- Is it worth worrying about what-if the beginner goes to somebody -->
<!-- else's Emacs session, which already has an Info running in the middle -->
<!-- of something-in which case these simple instructions won't work? -->

</div>

<h3 class="section">1.1 Starting Info on a Small Screen</h3>

<p>(In Info, you only see this section if your terminal has a small
number of lines; most readers pass by it without seeing it.)

</p>
<p><a name="index-small-screen_002c-moving-around-3"></a>Since your terminal has a relatively small number of lines on its
screen, it is necessary to give you special advice at the beginning.

   </p>
<p>If the entire text you are looking at fits on the screen, the text
`<samp><span class="samp">All</span></samp>' will be displayed near the bottom of the screen, on the
mode line (usually, the line in inverse video).  If you see the text
`<samp><span class="samp">Top</span></samp>' instead, it means that there is more text below that does
not fit.  To move forward through the text and see another screenful,
press &lt;SPC&gt;, the Space bar.  To move back up, press the key
labeled `<samp><span class="samp">Backspace</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">DEL</span></samp>' (on some keyboards, this key
might be labeled `<samp><span class="samp">Delete</span></samp>').  In a graphical Emacs, you can also use
<kbd>S-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> (press and hold the &lt;Shift&gt; key and then press
&lt;SPC&gt;) to move backwards, but this does not work in the
stand-alone Info reader (nor in Emacs, if you are using it in a
text-mode terminal).

</p>
<mbp:pagebreak></mbp:pagebreak><div class="node"><a name="Help"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">1.2 How to use Info</h3>

<p>You are talking to the program Info, for reading documentation.

   </p>
<p>There are two ways to use Info: from within Emacs or as a
stand-alone reader that you can invoke from a shell using the command
<samp><span class="command">info</span></samp>.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-node_002c-in-Info-documents-4"></a>  Right now you are looking at one <dfn>Node</dfn> of Information. 
A node contains text describing a specific topic at a specific
level of detail.  This node's topic is “how to use Info”.  The mode
line says that this is node `<samp><span class="samp">Help</span></samp>' in the file <samp><span class="file">info</span></samp>.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-header-of-Info-node-5"></a>  The top line of a node is its <dfn>header</dfn>.  This node's header
(look at it now) says that the `<samp><span class="samp">Next</span></samp>' node after this one is the
node called `<samp><span class="samp">Help-P</span></samp>'.  An advanced Info command lets you go to
any node whose name you know.  In the stand-alone Info reader program,
the header line shows the names of this node and the Info file as
well.  In Emacs, the header line is displayed with a special typeface,
and remains at the top of the window all the time even if you scroll
through the node.

   </p>
<p>Besides a `<samp><span class="samp">Next</span></samp>', a node can have a `<samp><span class="samp">Previous</span></samp>' link, or an
`<samp><span class="samp">Up</span></samp>' link, or both.  As you can see, this node has all of these
links.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-n-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-6"></a>  Now it is time to move on to the `<samp><span class="samp">Next</span></samp>' node, named `<samp><span class="samp">Help-P</span></samp>'.

</p>
<pre class="format">&gt;&gt; Type <kbd>n</kbd> to move there.  Type just one character;
   do not type the quotes and do not type a &lt;RET&gt; afterward.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">`<samp><span class="samp">&gt;&gt;</span></samp>' in the margin means it is really time to try a command.

</p>
<pre class="format">&gt;&gt; If you are in Emacs and have a mouse, and if you already practiced
   typing <kbd>n</kbd> to get to the next node, click now with the left
   mouse button on the `<samp><span class="samp">Next</span></samp>' link to do the same “the mouse way”.
</pre>
   <mbp:pagebreak></mbp:pagebreak><div class="node">
<a name="Help-P"></a><a name="Help_002dP"></a>
</div>

<h3 class="section">1.3 Returning to the Previous node</h3>

<p><a name="index-p-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-7"></a>This node is called `<samp><span class="samp">Help-P</span></samp>'.  The `<samp><span class="samp">Previous</span></samp>' node, as you see,
is `<samp><span class="samp">Help</span></samp>', which is the one you just came from using the <kbd>n</kbd>
command.  Another <kbd>n</kbd> command now would take you to the next
node, `<samp><span class="samp">Help-^L</span></samp>'.

</p>
<pre class="format">&gt;&gt; But do not type <kbd>n</kbd> yet.  First, try the <kbd>p</kbd> command, or
   (in Emacs) click on the `<samp><span class="samp">Prev</span></samp>' link.  That takes you to
   the `<samp><span class="samp">Previous</span></samp>' node.  Then use <kbd>n</kbd> to return here.
</pre>
   <p>If you read this in Emacs, you will see an `<samp><span class="samp">Info</span></samp>' item in the
menu bar, close to its right edge.  Clicking the mouse on the
`<samp><span class="samp">Info</span></samp>' menu-bar item opens a menu of commands which include
`<samp><span class="samp">Next</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">Previous</span></samp>' (and also some others which you didn't yet
learn about).

   </p>
<p>This all probably seems insultingly simple so far, but <em>please
don't</em> start skimming.  Things will get complicated soon enough! 
Also, please do not try a new command until you are told it is time
to.  You could make Info skip past an important warning that was
coming up.

</p>
<pre class="format">&gt;&gt; Now do an <kbd>n</kbd>, or (in Emacs) click the middle mouse button on
   the `<samp><span class="samp">Next</span></samp>' link, to get to the node `<samp><span class="samp">Help-^L</span></samp>' and learn more.
</pre>
   <mbp:pagebreak></mbp:pagebreak><div class="node">
<a name="Help-%5eL"></a><a name="Help_002d_005eL"></a>
</div>

<h3 class="section">1.4 The Space, DEL, B and ^L commands</h3>

<p>This node's mode line tells you that you are now at node
`<samp><span class="samp">Help-^L</span></samp>', and the header line tells you that <kbd>p</kbd> would get
you back to `<samp><span class="samp">Help-P</span></samp>'.  The node's title is highlighted and may be
underlined as well; it says what the node is about.

   </p>
<p>This is a big node and it does not all fit on your display screen. 
You can tell that there is more that is not visible because you
can see the text `<samp><span class="samp">Top</span></samp>' rather than `<samp><span class="samp">All</span></samp>' near the bottom of
the screen.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-SPC-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-8"></a><a name="index-DEL-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-9"></a><a name="index-BACKSPACE-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-10"></a><a name="index-Info_002dscroll_002dup-11"></a><a name="index-Info_002dscroll_002ddown-12"></a>  The &lt;SPC&gt;, &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; (or &lt;DEL&gt;)<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a> and <kbd>b</kbd> commands exist to
allow you to “move around” in a node that does not all fit on the
screen at once.  &lt;SPC&gt; moves forward, to show what was below the
bottom of the screen.  &lt;DEL&gt; or &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; moves backward, to
show what was above the top of the screen (there is not anything above
the top until you have typed some spaces).

</p>
<pre class="format">&gt;&gt; Now try typing a &lt;SPC&gt; (afterward, type a &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; to
   return here).
</pre>
   <p>When you type the &lt;SPC&gt;, the two lines that were at the bottom of
the screen appear at the top, followed by more lines.  &lt;DEL&gt; or
&lt;BACKSPACE&gt; takes the two lines from the top and moves them to the
bottom, <em>usually</em>, but if there are not a full screen's worth of
lines above them they may not make it all the way to the bottom.

   </p>
<p>If you are reading this in Emacs, note that the header line is
always visible, never scrolling off the display.  That way, you can
always see the `<samp><span class="samp">Next</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">Prev</span></samp>', and `<samp><span class="samp">Up</span></samp>' links, and you
can conveniently go to one of these links at any time by
clicking the middle mouse button on the link.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-reading-Info-documents-top-to-bottom-13"></a><a name="index-Info-documents-as-tutorials-14"></a>  &lt;SPC&gt; and &lt;DEL&gt; not only move forward and backward through
the current node.  They also move between nodes.  &lt;SPC&gt; at the end
of a node moves to the next node; &lt;DEL&gt; (or &lt;BACKSPACE&gt;) at
the beginning of a node moves to the previous node.  In effect, these
commands scroll through all the nodes in an Info file as a single
logical sequence.  You can read an entire manual top to bottom by just
typing &lt;SPC&gt;, and move backward through the entire manual from
bottom to top by typing &lt;DEL&gt; (or &lt;BACKSPACE&gt;).

   </p>
<p>In this sequence, a node's subnodes appear following their parent. 
If a node has a menu, &lt;SPC&gt; takes you into the subnodes listed in
the menu, one by one.  Once you reach the end of a node, and have seen
all of its subnodes, &lt;SPC&gt; takes you to the next node or to the
parent's next node.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-PAGEUP-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-15"></a><a name="index-PAGEDOWN-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-16"></a>  Many keyboards nowadays have two scroll keys labeled `<samp><span class="samp">PageUp</span></samp>'
and `<samp><span class="samp">PageDown</span></samp>' (or maybe `<samp><span class="samp">Prior</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">Next</span></samp>').  If your
keyboard has these keys, you can use them to move forward and backward
through the text of one node, like &lt;SPC&gt; and &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; (or
&lt;DEL&gt;).  However, &lt;PAGEUP&gt; and &lt;PAGEDOWN&gt; keys never
scroll beyond the beginning or the end of the current node.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-C_002dl-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-17"></a>  If your screen is ever garbaged, you can tell Info to display it
again by typing <kbd>C-l</kbd> (<kbd>Control-L</kbd>—that is, hold down
&lt;CTRL&gt; and type <kbd>L</kbd> or <kbd>l</kbd>).

</p>
<pre class="format">&gt;&gt; Type <kbd>C-l</kbd> now.
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-b-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-18"></a>  To move back to the beginning of the node you are on, you can type
the &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; key (or &lt;DEL&gt;) many times.  You can also type
<kbd>b</kbd> just once.  <kbd>b</kbd> stands for “beginning.”

</p>
<pre class="format">&gt;&gt; Try that now.  (We have put in enough verbiage to push this past
   the first screenful, but screens are so big nowadays that perhaps it
   isn't enough.  You may need to shrink your Emacs or Info window.)
   Then come back, by typing &lt;SPC&gt; one or more times.
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-g_t_003f-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-19"></a><a name="index-Info_002dsummary-20"></a>  You have just learned a considerable number of commands.  If you
want to use one but have trouble remembering which, you should type
<kbd>?</kbd>, which displays a brief list of commands.  When you are
finished looking at the list, make it go away by typing &lt;SPC&gt;
repeatedly.

</p>
<pre class="format">&gt;&gt; Type a &lt;?&gt; now.  Press &lt;SPC&gt; to see consecutive screenfuls of
   the list until finished.  Then type &lt;SPC&gt; several times.  If
   you are using Emacs, the help will then go away automatically.
   If you are using the stand-alone Info reader, type <kbd>x</kbd> to
   return here.
</pre>
   <p>From now on, you will encounter large nodes without warning, and
will be expected to know how to use &lt;SPC&gt; and &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; to
move around in them without being told.  Since not all terminals have
the same size screen, it would be impossible to warn you anyway.

</p>
<pre class="format">&gt;&gt; Now type <kbd>n</kbd>, or click the middle mouse button on the `<samp><span class="samp">Next</span></samp>' link,
   to visit the next node.
</pre>
   <mbp:pagebreak></mbp:pagebreak><div class="node">

<h3 class="section">1.5 Invisible text in Emacs Info</h3>

<p>Before discussing menus, we need to make some remarks that are only
relevant to users reading Info using Emacs.  Users of the stand-alone
version can skip this node by typing <kbd>]</kbd> now.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-invisible-text-in-Emacs-21"></a>  In Emacs, certain text that appears in the stand-alone version is
normally hidden, technically because it has the `<samp><span class="samp">invisibility</span></samp>'
property.  Invisible text is really a part of the text.  It becomes
visible (by default) after killing and yanking, it appears in printed
output, it gets saved to file just like any other text, and so on. 
Thus it is useful to know it is there.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-visible_002dmode-22"></a>You can make invisible text visible by using the command <kbd>M-x
visible-mode</kbd>.  Visible mode is a minor mode, so using the command a
second time will make the text invisible again.  Watch the effects of
the command on the “menu” below and the top line of this node.

   </p>
<p>If you prefer to <em>always</em> see the invisible text, you can set
<code>Info-hide-note-references</code> to <code>nil</code>.  Enabling Visible mode
permanently is not a real alternative, because Emacs Info also uses
(although less extensively) another text property that can change the
text being displayed, the `<samp><span class="samp">display</span></samp>' property.  Only the
invisibility property is affected by Visible mode.  When, in this
tutorial, we refer to the `<samp><span class="samp">Emacs</span></samp>' behavior, we mean the
<em>default</em> Emacs behavior.

<h4 class="subsection">1.5.1 The <kbd>]</kbd> and <kbd>[</kbd> commands</h4>

<p>If you type <kbd>n</kbd> now, you get an error message saying that this
node has no next node.  Similarly, if you type <kbd>p</kbd>, the error
message tells you that there is no previous node.  (The exact message
depends on the Info reader you use.)  This is because <kbd>n</kbd> and
<kbd>p</kbd> carry you to the next and previous node <em>at the same
level</em>.  The present node is contained in a menu (see next) of the
node you came from, and hence is considered to be at a lower level. 
It is the only node in the previous node's menu (even though it was
listed three times). Hence it has no next or previous node that
<kbd>n</kbd> or <kbd>p</kbd> could move to.

   </p>
<p>If you systematically move through a manual by typing <kbd>n</kbd>, you run
the risk of skipping many nodes.  You do not run this risk if you
systematically use <kbd>&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>, because, when you scroll to the
bottom of a node and type another <kbd>&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>, then this carries
you to the following node in the manual <em>regardless of level</em>. 
If you immediately want to go to that node, without having to scroll
to the bottom of the screen first, you can type <kbd>]</kbd>.

   </p>
<p>Similarly, <kbd>&lt;BACKSPACE&gt;</kbd> carries you to the preceding node
regardless of level, after you scrolled to the beginning of the
present node.  If you want to go to the preceding node immediately,
you can type <kbd>[</kbd>.

   </p>
<p>For instance, typing this sequence will come back here in three steps:
<kbd>[ n [</kbd>.  To do the same backward, type <kbd>] p ]</kbd>.

   </p>
<p>Now type <kbd>]</kbd> to go to the next node and learn about menus.

<h3 class="section">1.6 Menus and the <kbd>m</kbd> command</h3>

<p><a name="index-menus-in-an-Info-document-23"></a><a name="index-Info-menus-24"></a>  With only the <kbd>n</kbd> (next), <kbd>p</kbd> (previous), <kbd>&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>,
<kbd>&lt;BACKSPACE&gt;</kbd>, <kbd>]</kbd> and <kbd>[</kbd> commands for moving between
nodes, nodes are restricted to a linear sequence.  Menus allow a
branching structure.  A menu is a list of other nodes you can move to. 
It is actually just part of the text of the node formatted specially
so that Info can interpret it.  The beginning of a menu is always
identified by a line which starts with `<samp><span class="samp">* Menu:</span></samp>'<!-- /@w -->.  A node
contains a menu if and only if it has a line in it which starts that
way.  The only menu you can use at any moment is the one in the node
you are in.  To use a menu in any other node, you must move to that
node first.

   </p>
<p>After the start of the menu, each line that starts with a `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>'
identifies one subtopic.  The line usually contains a brief name for
the subtopic (followed by a `<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>', normally hidden in Emacs), the
name of the node that talks about that subtopic (again, normally
hidden in Emacs), and optionally some further description of the
subtopic.  Lines in the menu that do not start with a `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' have no
special meaning—they are only for the human reader's benefit and do
not define additional subtopics.  Here is an example:

</p>
<pre class="example">     * Foo:  Node about FOO.      This tells about FOO.
</pre>
   <p>The subtopic name is Foo, and the node describing it is `<samp><span class="samp">Node
about FOO</span></samp>'.  The rest of the line is just for the reader's
Information.  [[ But this line is not a real menu item, simply because
there is no line above it which starts with `<samp><span class="samp">* Menu:</span></samp>'<!-- /@w -->.  Also,
in a real menu item, the `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' would appear at the very start of
the line.  This is why the “normally hidden” text in Emacs, namely
`<samp><span class="samp">: Node about FOO.</span></samp>', is actually visible in this example, even
when Visible mode is off.]]

   </p>
<p>When you use a menu to go to another node (in a way that will be
described soon), what you specify is the subtopic name, the first
thing in the menu line.  Info uses it to find the menu line, extracts
the node name from it, and goes to that node.  The reason that there
is both a subtopic name and a node name is that the node name must be
meaningful to the computer and may therefore have to be ugly looking. 
The subtopic name can be chosen just to be convenient for the user to
specify.  Often the node name is convenient for the user to specify
and so both it and the subtopic name are the same.  There is an
abbreviation for this:

</p>
<pre class="example">     * Foo::   This tells about FOO.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This means that the subtopic name and node name are the same; they are
both `<samp><span class="samp">Foo</span></samp>'.  (The `<samp><span class="samp">::</span></samp>' is normally hidden in Emacs.)

</p>
<pre class="format">&gt;&gt; Now use &lt;SPC&gt; to find the menu in this node, then come back to
   the front with a <kbd>b</kbd> and some &lt;SPC&gt;s.  As you see, a menu is
   actually visible in its node.  If you cannot find a menu in a node
   by looking at it, then the node does not have a menu and the
   <kbd>m</kbd> command is not available.
</pre>
   <p>If you keep typing &lt;SPC&gt; once the menu appears on the screen, it
will move to another node (the first one in the menu).  If that
happens, type &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; to come back.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-m-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-25"></a>  The command to go to one of the subnodes is <kbd>m</kbd>.  This is very
different from the commands you have used: it is a command that
prompts you for more input.

   </p>
<p>The Info commands you know do not need additional input; when you
type one of them, Info processes it instantly and then is ready for
another command.  The <kbd>m</kbd> command is different: it needs to know
the <dfn>name of the subtopic</dfn>.  Once you have typed <kbd>m</kbd>, Info
tries to read the subtopic name.

   </p>
<p>Now, in the stand-alone Info, look for the line containing many
dashes near the bottom of the screen.  (This is the stand-alone
equivalent for the mode line in Emacs.)  There is one more line
beneath that one, but usually it is blank.  (In Emacs, this is the
echo area.)  When it is blank, Info is ready for a command, such as
<kbd>n</kbd> or <kbd>b</kbd> or &lt;SPC&gt; or <kbd>m</kbd>.  If that line contains
text ending in a colon, it means Info is reading more input for the
last command.  You can't type an Info command then, because Info is
trying to read input, not commands.  You must either give the input
and finish the command you started, or type <kbd>Control-g</kbd> to cancel
the command.  When you have done one of those things, the input entry
line becomes blank again.  Then you can type Info commands again.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-Info_002dmenu-26"></a>  The command to go to a subnode via a menu is <kbd>m</kbd>.  After you type
the <kbd>m</kbd>, the line at the bottom of the screen says `<samp><span class="samp">Menu item: </span></samp>'. 
You must then type the name of the subtopic you want, and end it with
a &lt;RET&gt;.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-abbreviating-Info-subnodes-27"></a>  You can abbreviate the subtopic name.  If the abbreviation is not
unique, the first matching subtopic is chosen.  Some menus put
the shortest possible abbreviation for each subtopic name in capital
letters, so you can see how much you need to type.  It does not
matter whether you use upper case or lower case when you type the
subtopic.  You should not put any spaces at the end, or inside of the
item name, except for one space where a space appears in the item in
the menu.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-completion-of-Info-node-names-28"></a>  You can also use the <dfn>completion</dfn> feature to help enter the
subtopic name.  If you type the &lt;TAB&gt; key after entering part of a
name, it will fill in more of the name—as much as Info can deduce
from the part you have entered.

   </p>
<p>If you move the cursor to one of the menu subtopic lines, then you do
not need to type the argument: you just type a &lt;RET&gt;, and it
stands for the subtopic of the line you are on.  You can also click
the middle mouse button directly on the subtopic line to go there.

   </p>
<p>Here is a menu to give you a chance to practice.  This menu gives you
three ways of going to one place, Help-FOO:

</p>
<ul class="menu">
<li>
<a accesskey="1" href="#Help_002dFOO">Foo</a>:        A node you can visit for fun. 
</li>
<li>
<a accesskey="2" href="#Help_002dFOO">Bar</a>:        We have made two ways to get to the same place. 
</li>
<li>
<a accesskey="3" href="#Help_002dFOO">Help-FOO</a>:             And yet another! 
</li>
</ul>

   <p>(Turn Visible mode on if you are using Emacs.)

</p>
<pre class="format">&gt;&gt;  Now type just an <kbd>m</kbd> and see what happens:
</pre>
   <p>Now you are “inside” an <kbd>m</kbd> command.  Commands cannot be used
now; the next thing you will type must be the name of a subtopic.

   </p>
<p>You can change your mind about doing the <kbd>m</kbd> by typing
<kbd>Control-g</kbd>.

</p>
<pre class="format">&gt;&gt; Try that now;  notice the bottom line clear.
</pre>
   <pre class="format">&gt;&gt; Then type another <kbd>m</kbd>.
</pre>
   <pre class="format">&gt;&gt; Now type <kbd>BAR</kbd>, the item name.  Do not type &lt;RET&gt; yet.
</pre>
   <p>While you are typing the item name, you can use the &lt;DEL&gt; (or
&lt;BACKSPACE&gt;) key to cancel one character at a time if you make a
mistake.

</p>
<pre class="format">&gt;&gt; Press &lt;DEL&gt; to cancel the `<samp><span class="samp">R</span></samp>'.  You could type another <kbd>R</kbd>
   to replace it.  But you do not have to, since `<samp><span class="samp">BA</span></samp>' is a valid
   abbreviation.
</pre>
   <pre class="format">&gt;&gt; Now you are ready to go.  Type a &lt;RET&gt;.
</pre>
   <p>After visiting `<samp><span class="samp">Help-FOO</span></samp>', you should return here.

   </p>
<p>Another way to move to the menu subtopic lines and between them is
to type &lt;TAB&gt;.  Each time you type a &lt;TAB&gt;, you move to the
next subtopic line.  To move to a previous subtopic line in the
stand-alone reader, type <kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>—that is, press and hold
the &lt;META&gt; key and then press &lt;TAB&gt;.  (On some keyboards, the
&lt;META&gt; key might be labeled `<samp><span class="samp">Alt</span></samp>'.)  In Emacs Info, type
<kbd>S-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> to move to a previous subtopic line (press and hold
the &lt;Shift&gt; key and then press &lt;TAB&gt;).

   </p>
<p>Once you move cursor to a subtopic line, press &lt;RET&gt; to go to
that subtopic's node.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-mouse-support-in-Info-mode-29"></a><a name="index-mouse_002d2-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-30"></a>  If your terminal supports a mouse, you have yet another way of going
to a subtopic.  Move your mouse pointer to the subtopic line,
somewhere between the beginning `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' and the colon `<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>' which
ends the subtopic's brief name.  You will see the subtopic's name
change its appearance (usually, its background color will change), and
the shape of the mouse pointer will change if your platform supports
that.  After a while, if you leave the mouse on that spot, a small
window will pop up, saying “mouse-2: go to that node,” or the same
message may appear at the bottom of the screen.

   </p>
<p><kbd>mouse-2</kbd> is the second button of your mouse counting from the
left—the middle button on a 3-button mouse.  (On a 2-button mouse,
you may have to press both buttons together to “press the middle
button”.)  The message tells you pressing <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> with the
current position of the mouse pointer (on subtopic in the menu) will
go to that subtopic.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-Info_002dmouse_002dfollow_002dnearest_002dnode-31"></a>  More generally, <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> in an Info buffer finds the nearest
link to another node and goes there.  For example, near a cross
reference it acts like <kbd>f</kbd>, in a menu it acts like <kbd>m</kbd>, on the
node's header line it acts like <kbd>n</kbd>, <kbd>p</kbd>, or <kbd>u</kbd>, etc.  At
end of the node's text <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> moves to the next node, or up if
there's no next node.

<h4 class="subsection">1.6.1 The <kbd>u</kbd> command</h4>

<p>Congratulations!  This is the node `<samp><span class="samp">Help-FOO</span></samp>'.  It has an `<samp><span class="samp">Up</span></samp>'
pointer `<samp><span class="samp">Help-M</span></samp>', the node you just came from via the <kbd>m</kbd>
command.  This is the usual convention—the nodes you reach from a menu
have `<samp><span class="samp">Up</span></samp>' nodes that lead back to the menu.  Menus move Down in the
tree, and `<samp><span class="samp">Up</span></samp>' moves Up.  `<samp><span class="samp">Previous</span></samp>', on the other hand, is
usually used to “stay on the same level but go backwards”.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-u-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-32"></a><a name="index-Info_002dup-33"></a>  You can go back to the node `<samp><span class="samp">Help-M</span></samp>' by typing the command
<kbd>u</kbd> for “Up”.  This puts you at the menu subtopic line pointing
to the subnode that the <kbd>u</kbd> command brought you from.  (Some Info
readers may put you at the <em>front</em> of the node instead—to get
back to where you were reading, you have to type some &lt;SPC&gt;s.)

   </p>
<p>Another way to go Up is to click <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> on the `<samp><span class="samp">Up</span></samp>'
pointer shown in the header line (provided that you have a mouse).

</p>

<h3 class="section">1.7 Following Cross-References</h3>

<p><a name="index-cross-references-in-Info-documents-34"></a>  In Info documentation, you will see many <dfn>cross references</dfn>. 
Cross references look like this: See <a href="#Help_002dCross">Cross</a>.  That text
is a real, live cross reference, whose name is `<samp><span class="samp">Cross</span></samp>' and which
points to the node named `<samp><span class="samp">Help-Cross</span></samp>'.  (The node name is hidden
in Emacs.  Do <kbd>M-x visible-mode</kbd> to show or hide it.)

   </p>
<p><a name="index-f-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-35"></a><a name="index-Info_002dfollow_002dreference-36"></a>  You can follow a cross reference by moving the cursor to it and
press &lt;RET&gt;, just as in a menu.  In Emacs, you can also click
<kbd>mouse-1</kbd> on a cross reference to follow it; you can see that the
cross reference is mouse-sensitive by moving the mouse pointer to the
reference and watching how the underlying text and the mouse pointer
change in response.

   </p>
<p>Another way to follow a cross reference is to type <kbd>f</kbd> and then
specify the name of the cross reference (in this case, `<samp><span class="samp">Cross</span></samp>')
as an argument.  For this command, it does not matter where the cursor
was.  If the cursor is on or near a cross reference, <kbd>f</kbd> suggests
that reference name in parentheses as the default; typing &lt;RET&gt;
will follow that reference.  However, if you type a different
reference name, <kbd>f</kbd> will follow the other reference which has that
name.

</p>
<pre class="format">&gt;&gt; Type <kbd>f</kbd>, followed by <kbd>Cross</kbd>, and then &lt;RET&gt;.
</pre>
   <p>As you enter the reference name, you can use the &lt;DEL&gt; (or
&lt;BACKSPACE&gt;) key to edit your input.  If you change your mind
about following any reference, you can use <kbd>Control-g</kbd> to cancel
the command.  Completion is available in the <kbd>f</kbd> command; you can
complete among all the cross reference names in the current node by
typing a &lt;TAB&gt;.

   </p>
<p>To get a list of all the cross references in the current node, you
can type <kbd>?</kbd> after an <kbd>f</kbd>.  The <kbd>f</kbd> continues to await a
cross reference name even after displaying the list, so if you don't
actually want to follow a reference, you should type a <kbd>Control-g</kbd>
to cancel the <kbd>f</kbd>.

</p>
<pre class="format">&gt;&gt; Type <kbd>f?</kbd> to get a list of the cross references in this node.  Then
   type a <kbd>Control-g</kbd> and see how the `<samp><span class="samp">f</span></samp>' gives up.
</pre>
   <p>The &lt;TAB&gt;, <kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> and <kbd>S-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> keys,
which move between menu items in a menu, also move between cross
references outside of menus.

   </p>
<p>Sometimes a cross reference (or a node) can lead to another file (in
other words another “manual”), or, on occasion, even a file on a
remote machine (although Info files distributed with Emacs or the
stand-alone Info avoid using remote links).  Such a cross reference
looks like this: See <a href="texinfo.html#Top">Overview of Texinfo</a>.  (After following this link, type
<kbd>l</kbd> to get back to this node.)  Here the name `<samp><span class="samp">texinfo</span></samp>'
between parentheses refers to the file name.  This file name appears
in cross references and node names if it differs from the current
file, so you can always know that you are going to be switching to
another manual and which one.

   </p>
<p>However, Emacs normally hides some other text in cross-references. 
If you put your mouse over the cross reference, then the information
appearing in a separate box (tool tip) or in the echo area will show
the full cross-reference including the file name and the node name of
the cross reference.  If you have a mouse, just leave it over the
cross reference See <a href="texinfo.html#Top">Overview of Texinfo</a>, and watch what happens.  If you
always like to have that information visible without having to move
your mouse over the cross reference, use <kbd>M-x visible-mode</kbd>, or
set <code>Info-hide-note-references</code> to a value other than <code>t</code>
(see <a href="#Emacs-Info-Variables">Emacs Info Variables</a>).

<p>While this node is specifically intended to be reached by a cross
reference, most cross references lead to nodes that “belong”
someplace else far away in the structure of an Info document.  So you
cannot expect this node to have a `<samp><span class="samp">Next</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">Previous</span></samp>' or

<h3 class="section">1.8 Some intermediate Info commands</h3>

<p>The introductory course is almost over; please continue
a little longer to learn some intermediate-level commands.

   </p>
<p>Most Info files have an index, which is actually a large node
containing little but a menu.  The menu has one menu item for each
topic listed in the index.  (As a special feature, menus for indices
may also include the line number within the node of the index entry. 
This allows Info readers to go to the exact line of an entry, not just
the start of the containing node.)

   </p>
<p>You can get to the index from the main menu of the file with the
<kbd>m</kbd> command and the name of the index node; then you can use the
<kbd>m</kbd> command again in the index node to go to the node that
describes the topic you want.

   </p>
<p>There is also a short-cut Info command, <kbd>i</kbd>, which does all of
that for you.  It searches the index for a given topic (a string) and
goes to the node which is listed in the index for that topic. 
See <a href="#Search-Index">Search Index</a>, for a full explanation.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-l-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-37"></a><a name="index-Info_002dhistory_002dback-38"></a><a name="index-going-back-in-Info-history-39"></a>  If you have been moving around to different nodes and wish to
retrace your steps, the <kbd>l</kbd> command (<kbd>l</kbd> for <dfn>last</dfn>) will
do that, one node-step at a time.  As you move from node to node, Info
records the nodes where you have been in a special history list.  The
<kbd>l</kbd> command revisits nodes in the history list; each successive
<kbd>l</kbd> command moves one step back through the history.

</p>
<pre class="format">&gt;&gt; Try typing <kbd>p p n</kbd> and then three <kbd>l</kbd>'s, pausing in between
to see what each <kbd>l</kbd> does.  You should wind up right back here.
</pre>
   <p>Note the difference between <kbd>l</kbd> and <kbd>p</kbd>: <kbd>l</kbd> moves to
where <em>you</em> last were, whereas <kbd>p</kbd> always moves to the node
which the header says is the `<samp><span class="samp">Previous</span></samp>' node (from this node, the
`<samp><span class="samp">Prev</span></samp>' link leads to `<samp><span class="samp">Help-Xref</span></samp>').

   </p>
<p><a name="index-r-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-40"></a><a name="index-Info_002dhistory_002dforward-41"></a><a name="index-going-forward-in-Info-history-42"></a>  You can use the <kbd>r</kbd> command (<code>Info-history-forward</code> in Emacs)
to revisit nodes in the history list in the forward direction, so that
<kbd>r</kbd> will return you to the node you came from by typing <kbd>l</kbd>.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-L-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-43"></a><a name="index-Info_002dhistory-44"></a><a name="index-history-list-of-visited-nodes-45"></a>  The <kbd>L</kbd> command (<code>Info-history</code> in Emacs) creates a virtual
node that contains a list of all nodes you visited.  You can select
a previously visited node from this menu to revisit it.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-d-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-46"></a><a name="index-Info_002ddirectory-47"></a><a name="index-go-to-Directory-node-48"></a>  The <kbd>d</kbd> command (<code>Info-directory</code> in Emacs) gets you
instantly to the Directory node.  This node, which is the first one
you saw when you entered Info, has a menu which leads (directly or
indirectly, through other menus), to all the nodes that exist.  The
Directory node lists all the manuals and other Info documents that
are, or could be, installed on your system.

</p>
<pre class="format">&gt;&gt; Try doing a <kbd>d</kbd>, then do an <kbd>l</kbd> to return here (yes,

<p>This is the end of the basic course on using Info.  You have learned
how to move in an Info document, and how to follow menus and cross

   </p>
<p>Another set of Info commands is useful when you need to find
something quickly in a manual—that is, when you need to use a manual

these search commands as well.  If you want to do that now, follow this
cross reference to <a href="#Advanced">Advanced</a>.

   </p>
<p>Yet another set of commands are meant for experienced users; you can
find them by looking in the Directory node for documentation on Info. 
Finding them will be a good exercise in using Info in the usual

<h2 class="chapter">2 Advanced Info Commands</h2>

<p>This chapter describes various advanced Info commands.  (If you
are using a stand-alone Info reader, there are additional commands
specific to it, which are documented in several chapters of <a href="info-stnd.html#Top">GNU Info</a>.)

   </p>
<p><a name="index-C_002dq-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-55"></a>  One advanced command useful with most of the others described here
is <kbd>C-q</kbd>, which “quotes” the next character so that it is
entered literally (see <a href="emacs.html#Inserting-Text">Inserting Text</a>).  For example, pressing <kbd>?</kbd> ordinarily brings up a list
of completion possibilities.  If you want to (for example) search for
an actual `<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>' character, the simplest way is to insert it using
<kbd>C-q ?</kbd>.  This works the same in Emacs and stand-alone Info.

<h3 class="section">2.1 <kbd>s</kbd> searches Info documents</h3>

<p><a name="index-searching-Info-documents-56"></a><a name="index-Info-document-as-a-reference-57"></a>  The commands which move between and inside nodes allow you to read
the entire manual or its large portions.  But what if you need to find
some information in the manual as fast as you can, and you don't know
or don't remember in what node to look for it?  This need arises when
you use a manual as a <dfn>reference</dfn>, or when it is impractical to
read the entire manual before you start using the programs it
describes.

   </p>
<p>Info has powerful searching facilities that let you find things
quickly.  You can search either the manual text or its indices.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-s-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-58"></a><a name="index-Info_002dsearch-59"></a>  The <kbd>s</kbd> command allows you to search a whole Info file for a string. 
It switches to the next node if and when that is necessary.  You
type <kbd>s</kbd> followed by the string to search for, terminated by
&lt;RET&gt;.  To search for the same string again, just <kbd>s</kbd> followed
by &lt;RET&gt; will do.  The file's nodes are scanned in the order
they are in the file, which has no necessary relationship to the
order that they may be in the tree structure of menus and `<samp><span class="samp">next</span></samp>'
pointers.  But normally the two orders are not very different.  In any
case, you can always look at the mode line to find out what node you have
reached, if the header is not visible (this can happen, because <kbd>s</kbd>
puts your cursor at the occurrence of the string, not at the beginning
of the node).

   </p>
<p><a name="index-C_002ds-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-60"></a><a name="index-C_002dr-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-61"></a><a name="index-isearch-62"></a>  Instead of using <kbd>s</kbd> in Emacs Info and in the stand-alone Info,
you can use an incremental search started with <kbd>C-s</kbd> or <kbd>C-r</kbd>. 
It can search through multiple Info nodes.  See <a href="emacs.html#Incremental-Search">Incremental Search</a>.  In Emacs, you can disable this behavior
by setting the variable <code>Info-isearch-search</code> to <code>nil</code>
(see <a href="#Emacs-Info-Variables">Emacs Info Variables</a>).

</p>
<mbp:pagebreak></mbp:pagebreak><div class="node"><a name="Search-Index"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">2.2 <kbd>i</kbd> searches the indices for specific subjects</h3>

<p><a name="index-searching-Info-indices-63"></a><a name="index-i-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-64"></a><a name="index-Info_002dindex-65"></a>  Since most topics in the manual should be indexed, you should try
the index search first before the text search.  The <kbd>i</kbd> command
prompts you for a subject and then looks up that subject in the
indices.  If it finds an index entry with the subject you typed, it
goes to the node to which that index entry points.  You should browse
through that node to see whether the issue you are looking for is
described there.  If it isn't, type <kbd>,</kbd> one or more times to go
through additional index entries which match your subject.

   </p>
<p>The <kbd>i</kbd> command and subsequent <kbd>,</kbd> commands find all index
entries which include the string you typed <em>as a substring</em>. 
For each match, Info shows in the echo area the full index entry it
found.  Often, the text of the full index entry already gives you
enough information to decide whether it is relevant to what you are
looking for, so we recommend that you read what Info shows in the echo
area before looking at the node it displays.

   </p>
<p>Since <kbd>i</kbd> looks for a substring, you can search for subjects even
if you are not sure how they are spelled in the index.  For example,
suppose you want to find something that is pertinent to commands which
complete partial input (e.g., when you type &lt;TAB&gt;).  If you want
to catch index entries that refer to “complete,” “completion,” and
“completing,” you could type <kbd>icomplet&lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.

   </p>
<p>Info documents which describe programs should index the commands,
options, and key sequences that the program provides.  If you are
looking for a description of a command, an option, or a key, just type
their names when <kbd>i</kbd> prompts you for a topic.  For example, if you
want to read the description of what the <kbd>C-l</kbd> key does, type
<kbd>iC-l&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> literally.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-Info_002dvirtual_002dindex-66"></a><a name="index-I-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-67"></a>Emacs provides the command <code>Info-virtual-index</code>, bound to the
<kbd>I</kbd> key.  This behaves like <kbd>i</kbd>, but constructs a virtual
info node displaying the results of an index search, making it easier
to select the one you want.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-info_002dapropos-68"></a><a name="index-index_002dapropos-69"></a>If you aren't sure which manual documents the topic you are looking
for, try the <kbd>M-x info-apropos</kbd> command in Emacs, or the <kbd>M-x
index-apropos</kbd> command in the stand-alone reader.  It prompts for
a string and then looks up that string in all the indices of all the
Info documents installed on your system.

</p>
<mbp:pagebreak></mbp:pagebreak><div class="node"><a name="Go-to-node"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">2.3 <kbd>g</kbd> goes to a node by name</h3>

<p><a name="index-g-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-70"></a><a name="index-Info_002dgoto_002dnode-71"></a><a name="index-go-to-a-node-by-name-72"></a>  If you know a node's name, you can go there by typing <kbd>g</kbd>, the
name, and &lt;RET&gt;.  Thus, <kbd>gTop&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> would go to the node
called `<samp><span class="samp">Top</span></samp>' in this file.  (This is equivalent to <kbd>t</kbd>, see
<a href="#Help_002dInt">Help-Int</a>.)  <kbd>gGo to node&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> would come back here.

   </p>
<p>Unlike <kbd>m</kbd>, <kbd>g</kbd> does not allow the use of abbreviations. 
But it does allow completion, so you can type &lt;TAB&gt; to complete a
partial node name.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-go-to-another-Info-file-73"></a>  To go to a node in another file, you can include the file name in the
node name by putting it at the front, in parentheses.  Thus,
<kbd>g(dir)Top&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> would go to the Info Directory node, which is
the node `<samp><span class="samp">Top</span></samp>' in the Info file <samp><span class="file">dir</span></samp>.  Likewise,
<kbd>g(emacs)Top&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> (or just <kbd>g(emacs)&lt;RET&gt;</kbd>) goes to the
top node of the Emacs manual.

   </p>
<p>The node name `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' specifies the whole file.  So you can look at
all of the current file by typing <kbd>g*&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> or all of any
other file with <kbd>g(</kbd><var>filename</var><kbd>)*&lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.

</p>
<mbp:pagebreak></mbp:pagebreak><div class="node"><a name="Choose-menu-subtopic"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">2.4 <kbd>1</kbd>–<kbd>9</kbd> choose a menu subtopic by its number</h3>

<p><a name="index-g_t1-_0040r_007bthrough_007d-9-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-74"></a><a name="index-Info_002dnth_002dmenu_002ditem-75"></a><a name="index-select-_0040var_007bn_007d_0027th-menu-item-76"></a>  If you begrudge each character of type-in which your system requires,
you might like to use the commands <kbd>1</kbd>, <kbd>2</kbd>, <kbd>3</kbd>, <kbd>4</kbd>,
<small class="dots">...</small>, <kbd>9</kbd>.  They are short for the <kbd>m</kbd> command together
with a name of a menu subtopic.  <kbd>1</kbd> goes through the first item
in the current node's menu; <kbd>2</kbd> goes through the second item, etc. 
In the stand-alone reader, <kbd>0</kbd> goes through the last menu item;
this is so you need not count how many entries are there.

   </p>
<p>If your display supports multiple fonts, colors or underlining, and
you are using Emacs's Info mode to read Info files, the third, sixth
and ninth menu items have a `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' that stands out, either in color
or in some other attribute, such as underline; this makes it easy to
see at a glance which number to use for an item.

   </p>
<p>Some terminals don't support either multiple fonts, colors or
underlining.  If you need to actually count items, it is better to use
<kbd>m</kbd> instead, and specify the name, or use &lt;TAB&gt; to quickly
move between menu items.

</p>
<mbp:pagebreak></mbp:pagebreak><div class="node"><a name="Create-Info-buffer"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">2.5 <kbd>M-n</kbd> creates a new independent Info buffer in Emacs</h3>

<p><a name="index-M_002dn-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-77"></a><a name="index-clone_002dbuffer-78"></a><a name="index-multiple-Info-buffers-79"></a>  If you are reading Info in Emacs, you can select a new independent
Info buffer in a new Emacs window by typing <kbd>M-n</kbd>.  The new buffer
starts out as an exact copy of the old one, but you will be able to
move independently between nodes in the two buffers.  (In Info mode,
<kbd>M-n</kbd> runs the Emacs command <code>clone-buffer</code>.)

   </p>
<p>In Emacs Info, you can also produce new Info buffers by giving a
numeric prefix argument to the <kbd>m</kbd> and <kbd>g</kbd> commands.  <kbd>C-u
m</kbd> and <kbd>C-u g</kbd> go to a new node in exactly the same way that
<kbd>m</kbd> and <kbd>g</kbd> do, but they do so in a new Info buffer which they
select in another window.

   </p>
<p>Another way to produce new Info buffers in Emacs is to use a numeric
prefix argument for the <kbd>C-h i</kbd> command (<code>info</code>) which
switches to the Info buffer with that number.  Thus, <kbd>C-u 2 C-h i</kbd>
switches to the buffer <samp><span class="file">*info*&lt;2&gt;</span></samp>, creating it if necessary.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-info_002ddisplay_002dmanual-80"></a>  If you have created many Info buffers in Emacs, you might find it
difficult to remember which buffer is showing which manual.  You can
use the command <kbd>M-x info-display-manual</kbd> to show an Info manual
by name, reusing an existing buffer if there is one.  When given a
prefix argument, this command limits the completion alternatives to
currently visited info files, thus giving a convenient way to switch
between several manuals.

<mbp:pagebreak></mbp:pagebreak><div class="node"><a name="Emacs-Info-Variables"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">2.6 Emacs Info-mode Variables</h3>

<p>The following variables may modify the behavior of Info-mode in Emacs;
you may wish to set one or several of these variables interactively,
or in your init file.  See <a href="emacs.html#Examining">Examining and Setting Variables</a>.  The stand-alone Info reader program has its own set of
variables, described in <a href="info-stnd.html#Variables">Manipulating Variables</a>.

     </p>
<dl>
<dt>
<code>Info-directory-list</code><a name="index-Info_002ddirectory_002dlist-81"></a>
</dt>
<dd>The list of directories to search for Info files.  Each element is a
string (directory name) or <code>nil</code> (try default directory).  If not
initialized Info uses the environment variable <samp><span class="env">INFOPATH</span></samp> to
initialize it, or <code>Info-default-directory-list</code> if there is no
<samp><span class="env">INFOPATH</span></samp> variable in the environment.

     <p>If you wish to customize the Info directory search list for both Emacs
Info and stand-alone Info, it is best to set the <samp><span class="env">INFOPATH</span></samp>
environment variable, since that applies to both programs.

     <br></p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>Info-additional-directory-list</code><a name="index-Info_002dadditional_002ddirectory_002dlist-82"></a>
</dt>
<dd>A list of additional directories to search for Info documentation files. 
These directories are not searched for merging the <samp><span class="file">dir</span></samp> file.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>Info-mode-hook</code><a name="index-Info_002dmode_002dhook-83"></a>
</dt>
<dd>Hooks run when <code>Info-mode</code> is called.  By default, it contains
the hook <code>turn-on-font-lock</code> which enables highlighting of Info
files.  You can change how the highlighting looks by customizing the
faces <code>info-node</code>, <code>info-xref</code>, <code>info-xref-visited</code>,
<code>info-header-xref</code>, <code>info-header-node</code>, <code>info-menu-header</code>,
<code>info-menu-star</code>, and <code>info-title-</code><var>n</var> (where <var>n</var>
is the level of the section, a number between 1 and 4).  To customize
a face, type <kbd>M-x customize-face &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>face</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>,
where <var>face</var> is one of the face names listed here.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>Info-fontify-maximum-menu-size</code><a name="index-Info_002dfontify_002dmaximum_002dmenu_002dsize-84"></a>
</dt>
<dd>Maximum size of menu to fontify if <code>font-lock-mode</code> is non-<code>nil</code>.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>Info-fontify-visited-nodes</code><a name="index-Info_002dfontify_002dvisited_002dnodes-85"></a>
</dt>
<dd>If non-<code>nil</code>, menu items and cross-references pointing to visited
nodes are displayed in the <code>info-xref-visited</code> face.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>Info-use-header-line</code><a name="index-Info_002duse_002dheader_002dline-86"></a>
</dt>
<dd>If non-<code>nil</code>, Emacs puts in the Info buffer a header line showing
the `<samp><span class="samp">Next</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">Prev</span></samp>', and `<samp><span class="samp">Up</span></samp>' links.  A header line does
not scroll with the rest of the buffer, making these links always
visible.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>Info-hide-note-references</code><a name="index-Info_002dhide_002dnote_002dreferences-87"></a>
</dt>
<dd>As explained in earlier nodes, the Emacs version of Info normally
hides some text in menus and cross-references.  You can completely
disable this feature, by setting this option to <code>nil</code>.  Setting
it to a value that is neither <code>nil</code> nor <code>t</code> produces an
intermediate behavior, hiding a limited amount of text, but showing
all text that could potentially be useful.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>Info-scroll-prefer-subnodes</code><a name="index-Info_002dscroll_002dprefer_002dsubnodes-88"></a>
</dt>
<dd>If set to a non-<code>nil</code> value, &lt;SPC&gt; and &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; (or
&lt;DEL&gt;, or <kbd>S-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>) keys in a menu visit subnodes of the
current node before scrolling to its end or beginning, respectively. 
For example, if the node's menu appears on the screen, the next
&lt;SPC&gt; moves to a subnode indicated by the following menu item. 
Setting this option to <code>nil</code> results in behavior similar to the
stand-alone Info reader program, which visits the first subnode from
the menu only when you hit the end of the current node.  The default
is <code>nil</code>.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>Info-isearch-search</code><a name="index-Info_002disearch_002dsearch-89"></a>
</dt>
<dd>If non-<code>nil</code>, isearch in Info searches through multiple nodes.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>Info-enable-active-nodes</code><a name="index-Info_002denable_002dactive_002dnodes-90"></a>
</dt>
<dd>When set to a non-<code>nil</code> value, allows Info to execute Lisp code
associated with nodes.  The Lisp code is executed when the node is
selected.  The Lisp code to be executed should follow the node
delimiter (the `<samp><span class="samp">DEL</span></samp>' character) and an `<samp><span class="samp">execute: </span></samp>' tag, like
this:

     <pre class="example">          ^_execute: (message "This is an active node!")

Sections then there are none.

     </p>
<p>The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

     </p>
<p>A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. 
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

     </p>
<p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, SGML or XML using a publicly available
DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and
JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

     </p>
<p>The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title Page” means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     </p>
<p>The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.

     </p>
<p>A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as “Acknowledgements”,
“Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)  To “Preserve the Title”
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section “Entitled XYZ” according to this definition.

     </p>
<p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

     </p>
</li>
<li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     </p>
<p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     </p>
</li>
<li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     </p>
<p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     </p>
<p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. 
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

     </p>
<p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     </p>
</li>
<li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

          </p>
<ol type="A" start="1">
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

          </li>
<li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

          </li>
<li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

          </li>
<li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

          </li>
<li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

          </li>
<li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

          </li>
<li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

          </li>
<li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

          </li>
<li>Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled “History” in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

          </li>
<li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the “History” section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

          </li>
<li>For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

          </li>
<li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

          </li>
<li>Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

          </li>
<li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled “Endorsements” or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

          </li>
<li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          </li>
</ol>

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     </p>
<p>You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     </p>
<p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     </p>
<p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     </p>
</li>
<li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

     </p>
<p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     </p>
<p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled “History”
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
“History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You must delete all
sections Entitled “Endorsements.”

     </p>
</li>
<li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     </p>
<p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     </p>
</li>
<li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. 
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

     </p>
<p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. 
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

     </p>
</li>
<li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     </p>
<p>If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
“Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

     </p>
</li>
<li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     </p>
<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

     </p>
<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

     </p>
<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

     </p>
</li>
<li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

     </p>
<p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

     </p>
</li>
<li>RELICENSING

     <p>“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.

     </p>
<p>“CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

     </p>
<p>“Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.

     </p>
<p>An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

     </p>
<p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

        </p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="heading">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">       Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the “with<small class="dots">...</small>Texts.” line with this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">         with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being <var>list</var>.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   </p>
<p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.

<p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> The key which
we call “Backspace or DEL” in this manual is labeled differently on
different keyboards.  Look for a key which is a little ways above the
&lt;ENTER&gt; or &lt;RET&gt; key and which you normally use outside Emacs
to erase the character before the cursor, i.e., the character you
typed last.  It might be labeled `<samp><span class="samp">Backspace</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">&lt;-</span></samp>' or
`<samp><span class="samp">DEL</span></samp>', or sometimes `<samp><span class="samp">Delete</span></samp>'.</p>
