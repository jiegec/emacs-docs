<h2 class="chapter">1 Overview of the EDT Package</h2>

<p>This manual describes version 4.0 of the EDT Emulation for Emacs.
It comes with special functions which replicate nearly all of
EDT’s keypad mode behavior.  It sets up default keypad and function key
bindings which closely match those found in EDT.  Support is provided so
that users may reconfigure most keypad and function key bindings to
their own liking.
</p>
<p>Version 4.0 contains several enhancements (see <a href="#Changes">Changes</a>).

<h3 class="section">1.1 How to Begin Using EDT</h3>

<p>To start the EDT Emulation, first start Emacs and then enter <kbd>M-x
edt-emulation-on</kbd> to begin the emulation.  After initialization is
complete, the following message will appear below the status line
informing you that the emulation has been enabled: “Default EDT keymap
active”.
</p>
<p>You can have the EDT Emulation start up automatically, each time you
initiate an Emacs session, by adding the following line to your
<samp>.emacs</samp> file:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook 'edt-emulation-on)
</pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Be sure to read the rest of this manual.
It contains very useful information on how the EDT Emulation behaves and
how to customize it to your liking.
</p>
<p>The EDT emulation consists of the following files:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <samp>edt.texi</samp>—This manual.

</li>
<li> <samp>edt-user.el</samp>—An example customization file (located in the
Emacs distribution etc directory).

</li>
<li> <samp>edt.el</samp>—EDT emulation functions and default configuration.

</li>
<li> <samp>edt-lk201.el</samp>—Built-in support for DEC LK-201 keyboards.

</li>
<li> <samp>edt-vt100.el</samp>—Built-in support for DEC VT-100 (and above) terminals.

</li>
<li> <samp>edt-pc.el</samp>—Built-in support for PC 101 Keyboards under MS-DOS.

</li>
<li> <samp>edt-mapper.el</samp>—Create an EDT LK-201 map file for keyboards
without built-in support.

</li>
</ul>

<a name="What_0027s-New-in-Version-4_002e0"></a>
<h3 class="section">1.2 What’s New in Version 4.0</h3>

<p>Version 4.0 contains the following enhancements:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Scroll margins at the top and bottom of the window are now supported.
(The design was copied from <samp>tpu-extras.el</samp>.)  By default, this
feature is enabled with the top margin set to 10% of the window and the
bottom margin set to 15% of the window.  To change these settings, you
can invoke the function <code>edt-set-scroll-margins</code> in your
<samp>.emacs</samp> file.  For example, the following line

<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(edt-set-scroll-margins "20%" "25%")
</pre>
</div>

<p>sets the top margin to 20% of the window and the bottom margin
to 25% of the window.  To disable this feature, set each margin to 0%.
You can also invoke <code>edt-set-scroll-margins</code> interactively while
EDT Emulation is active to change the settings for that session.
</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Another way to set the scroll margins is to use
the Emacs customization feature to set the following two variables
directly: <code>edt-top-scroll-margin</code> and <code>edt-bottom-scroll-margin</code>.
</p>
<p>Enter the Emacs <code>customize</code> command.  First select the
‘<samp>Editing</samp>’ group and then select the ‘<samp>Emulations</samp>’ group.
Finally, select the ‘<samp>Edt</samp>’ group and follow the directions.
</p>
</li>
<li> The ‘<samp>SUBS</samp>’ command is now supported and bound to <kbd>GOLD-Enter</kbd>
by default.  (This design was copied from <samp>tpu-edt.el</samp>.)  Note, in
earlier versions of EDT Emulation, <kbd>GOLD-Enter</kbd> was assigned to the
Emacs function <code>query-replace</code>.  The binding of
<code>query-replace</code> has been moved to <kbd>GOLD-/</kbd>.  If you prefer to
restore <code>query-replace</code> to <kbd>GOLD-Enter</kbd>, then use an EDT user
customization file, <samp>edt-user.el</samp>, to do this
(see <a href="#Customizing">Customizing</a>).

</li>
<li> EDT Emulation now also works in XEmacs, including the highlighting of
selected text.

</li>
<li> If you access a workstation using an X Server, observe that the
initialization file generated by <samp>edt-mapper.el</samp> will now contain
the name of the X Server vendor.  This is a convenience for those who
have access to their Unix account from more than one type of X Server.
Since different X Servers typically require different EDT emulation
initialization files, <samp>edt-mapper.el</samp> will now generate these
different initialization files and save them with different names.
Then, the correct initialization file for the particular X server in use
is loaded correctly automatically.

</li>
<li> Also, <samp>edt-mapper.el</samp> is now capable of binding an <acronym>ASCII</acronym>
key sequence, providing the <acronym>ASCII</acronym> key sequence prefix is
already known by Emacs to be a prefix.  As a result of providing this
support, some terminal/keyboard/window system configurations, which
don’t have a complete set of sensible function key bindings built into
Emacs in <code>function-key-map</code>, can still be configured for use with
EDT Emulation.  (Note: In a few rare circumstances this does not work
properly.  In particular, it does not work if a subset of the leading
<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters in a key sequence are recognized by Emacs as
having an existing binding.  For example, if the keypad 7 (<tt class="key">KP7</tt>)
key generates the sequence ‘<samp>&lt;ESC&gt;Ow</samp>’ and ‘<samp>&lt;ESC&gt;O</samp>’ is already
bound to a function, pressing <tt class="key">KP7</tt> when told to do so by
<samp>edt-mapper.el</samp> will result in <samp>edt-mapper.el</samp> incorrectly
mapping ‘<samp>&lt;ESC&gt;O</samp>’ to <tt class="key">KP7</tt> and ‘<samp>w</samp>’ to <tt class="key">KP8</tt>.  If
something like this happens to you, it is probably a bug in the support
for your keyboard within Emacs <strong>or</strong> a bug in the Unix
termcap/terminfo support for your terminal <strong>or</strong> a bug in the
terminal emulation software you are using.)

</li>
<li> The <code>edt-quit</code> function (bound to <kbd>GOLD-q</kbd> by default) has been
modified to warn the user when file-related buffer modifications exist.
It now cautions the user that those modifications will be lost if the
user quits without saving those buffers.

<a name="The-Aims-of-this-Package"></a>
<h3 class="section">1.3 The Aims of this Package</h3>

<ol>
<li> Emulate EDT Keypad Mode commands closely so that current EDT users will
find that it easy and comfortable to use Emacs with a small learning
curve.

</li>
<li> Make it easy for a user to customize EDT emulation key bindings without
knowing much about Emacs Lisp.

</li>
<li> Make it easy to switch between the original EDT default bindings and the
user’s customized EDT bindings, without having to exit Emacs.

</li>
<li> Provide support for some TPU/EVE functions not supported in EDT.

</li>
<li> Provide an easy way to restore <strong>all</strong> original Emacs key bindings,
just as they existed before the EDT emulation was first invoked.

</li>
<li> Support Emacs and XEmacs 19 and higher.

</li>
<li> Supports highlighting of marked text within the EDT emulation on all
platforms on which Emacs supports highlighting of marked text.

</li>
<li> Handle terminal configuration interactively for most terminal
configurations, when the emulation is invoked for the first time.

</li>
<li> Support a PC AT keyboard under MS-DOS.

<h2 class="chapter">2 Terminals/Keyboards that are Supported</h2>

<p>Keyboards used under a Window System are supported via the
<code>edt-mapper</code> function.  The first time you invoke the emulation
under a window system, the <code>edt-mapper</code> function is run
automatically and the user is prompted to identify which keys the
emulation is to use for the standard keypad and function keys EDT
expects (e.g., <tt class="key">PF1</tt>, <tt class="key">PF2</tt>, <tt class="key">KP0</tt>, <tt class="key">KP1</tt>, <tt class="key">F1</tt>,
<tt class="key">F2</tt>, etc.).  This configuration is saved to disk read each time the
emulation is invoked.
</p>
<p>In character oriented connections not running a window manager, built-in
support for the following terminals/keyboards is provided:
</p>
<ol>
<li> DEC VT-100 series and higher.  This includes well behaved VT clones and
emulators.  If you are using a VT series terminal, be sure that the
<code>TERM</code> environment variable is set properly before invoking emacs.

</li>
<li> PC AT keyboard under MS-DOS.

<a name="How-to-Get-Started"></a>
<h2 class="chapter">3 How to Get Started</h2>

<p>Start up Emacs and enter <kbd>M-x edt-emulation-on</kbd> to begin the
emulation.  After initialization is complete, the following message will
appear below the status line informing you that the emulation has been
enabled: “Default EDT keymap active”.
</p>
<p>You can have the EDT Emulation start up automatically, each time you
initiate an Emacs session, by adding the following line to your
<samp>.emacs</samp> file:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook 'edt-emulation-on)
</pre>
</div>

<p>A reference sheet is included (later on) listing the default EDT
Emulation key bindings.  This sheet is also accessible on line from
within Emacs by pressing <tt class="key">PF2</tt>, <kbd>GOLD-H</kbd>, or ‘<samp>HELP</samp>’ (when
in the EDT Default Mode).
</p>
<p>It is easy to customize key bindings in the EDT Emulation
(see <a href="#Customizing">Customizing</a>).  Customizations are placed in a file called
<samp>edt-user.el</samp>.  The Emacs <samp>etc/</samp> directory contains an
example.  If <samp>edt-user.el</samp> is found in your Emacs load path
during EDT Emulation initialization, then the following message will
appear below the status line indicating that the emulation has been
enabled, enhanced by your own customizations: “User EDT custom keymap
active”.
</p>
<p>Once enabled, it is easy to switch back and forth between your
customized EDT Emulation key bindings and the default EDT Emulation key
bindings.  (Look at the binding to <kbd>GOLD-Z</kbd> in the sample
<samp>edt-user.el</samp> file.)  It is also easy to turn off the emulation
(via the command <code>edt-emulation-off</code>).  Doing so completely
restores the original key bindings in effect just prior to invoking the
emulation.
</p>
<p>Emacs binds keys to <acronym>ASCII</acronym> control characters and so does the
real EDT.  Where EDT key bindings and Emacs key bindings conflict,
the default Emacs key bindings are retained by the EDT emulation by
default.  If you are a diehard EDT user you may not like this.  The
<a href="#Control-keys">Control keys</a> section explains how to change this so that the EDT
bindings to <acronym>ASCII</acronym> control characters override the default
Emacs bindings.

<h3 class="section">4.1 Sun Workstations Running X</h3>

<p>Some earlier Sun keyboards do not have arrow keys separate from the
keypad keys.  It is difficult to emulate the full EDT keypad and still
retain use of the arrow keys on such keyboards.
</p>
<p>The Sun Type 5 and other more recent Sun keyboards, however, do have
separate arrow keys.  This makes them candidates for setting up a
reasonable EDT keypad emulation.
</p>
<p>Depending upon the configuration of the version of X installed on your
system, you may find the default X keynames for the keypad keys don’t
permit Emacs to interpret some or all the keypad keys as something other
than arrow keys, numeric keys, <tt class="key">Home</tt>, <tt class="key">PageUp</tt>, etc.  Both Sun
and HP have been particularly guilty of making bizarre keysym
assignments to the keypad keys.
</p>
<p>In most cases, the X Windows command, <code>xmodmap</code>, can be used to
correct the problem.  Here’s a sample <samp>.xmodmaprc</samp> file which
corrects this problem on one Sun workstation configuration using an
older SunOS release configured with a Sun Type 5 keyboard:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">! File:  .xmodmaprc
!
! Set up Sun Type 5 keypad for use with the Emacs EDT Emulation
!
keycode  53 = KP_Divide
keycode  54 = KP_Multiply
keycode  57 = KP_Decimal
keycode  75 = KP_7
keycode  76 = KP_8
keycode  77 = KP_9
keycode  78 = KP_Subtract
keycode  97 = KP_Enter
keycode  98 = KP_4
keycode  99 = KP_5
keycode 100 = KP_6
keycode 101 = KP_0
keycode 105 = F24
keycode 119 = KP_1
keycode 120 = KP_2
keycode 121 = KP_3
keycode 132 = KP_Add
</pre>
</div>

<p>If <samp>edt-mapper.el</samp> does not recognize your keypad keys as unique
keys, use the command ‘<samp>xmodmap -pke</samp>’ to get a listing of the actual
key codes and the keysyms mapped to them and then generate you own
custom <samp>.xmodmaprc</samp> similar to the one above.
</p>
<p>Next, feed <samp>.xmodmaprc</samp> to the <code>xmodmap</code> command and all the
Sun Type 5 keypad keys will now be configurable for the emulation of an
LK-201 keypad (less the <tt class="key">,</tt> key).  In this example, the line
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">keycode 105 = F24
</pre>
</div>

<p>changes the X Windows name of the keypad <tt class="key">NumLock</tt> key to
be known internally as the <tt class="key">F24</tt> key.  Doing so permits it to be
configured to behave as the <tt class="key">PF1</tt> (<tt class="key">GOLD</tt>) key.
</p>
<p>The side effect of this change is that you will no longer have a
<tt class="key">NumLock</tt> key.  If you are using other software under X which
requires a <tt class="key">NumLock</tt> key, then examine your keyboard and look for
one you don’t use and redefine it to be the <tt class="key">NumLock</tt> key.
Basically, you need to clear the <tt class="key">NumLock</tt> key from being assigned
as a modifier, assign it to the key of your choice, and then add it back
as a modifier.  (<a href="#Unix">Unix</a> for further help on how to do this.)

<p>The default X server configuration varies from distribution to
distribution and release to release of GNU/Linux.  If your system fails
to recognize the keypad keys as distinct keys, change the NumLock state,
turning it on or off, as the case may be, then try again.  If this
doesn’t solve your problem, you may have to modify the X keysym mappings
with <code>xmodmap</code>.
</p>
<p>On one distribution on an Intel PC, the following <samp>.xmodmaprc</samp> set
things up nicely.

<div class="example">

<p>In this example, after feeding the file to the <code>xmodmap</code> command,
the PC <tt class="key">NumLock</tt> keypad key will be configurable for the emulation
of the <tt class="key">PF1</tt> key.  The PC keypad can now emulate an LK-201 keypad
(less the comma key), the standard keyboard supplied with DEC terminals
VT-200 and above.  This <samp>.xmodmaprc</samp> file switches the role of the
<tt class="key">F12</tt> and <tt class="key">NumLock</tt> keys.  It has been tested on RedHat
GNU/Linux 5.2.  Other versions of GNU/Linux may require different
keycodes.  (<a href="#Unix">Unix</a> for further help on how to do this.)
</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Remember, it may be necessary to have <tt class="key">NumLock</tt> in

<p>Making the physical <tt class="key">NumLock</tt> key available for use in the EDT Emulation
requires some modification to the default X Window settings.  Since the
keycode assignments vary from system to system, some investigation is
needed to see how to do this on a particular system.
</p>
<p>You will need to look at the output generated by <code>xmodmap</code> invoked
with the "-pm" switch.  For example, on RedHat GNU/Linux 5.2 on a PC, we
get the following output when running ‘<samp>xmodmap -pm</samp>’:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">xmodmap:  up to 2 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):

shift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)
lock        Caps_Lock (0x42)
control     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x6d)
mod1        Alt_L (0x40),  Alt_R (0x71)
mod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)
mod3
mod4
mod5        Scroll_Lock (0x4e)
</pre>
</div>

<p>Note that Num_Lock is assigned to the modifier ‘<samp>mod2</samp>’.  This is
what hides Num_Lock from being seen by Emacs.
</p>
<p>Now, ‘<samp>xmodmap -pke</samp>’ yields:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">   .
   .
   .
keycode  77 = Num_Lock Pointer_EnableKeys
   .
   .
   .
keycode  96 = F12
   .
   .
   .
</pre>
</div>

<p>So, in RedHat GNU/Linux 5.2 on a PC, Num_Lock generates keycode 77.
The following steps are taken:
</p>
<ol>
<li> clear the assignment of Num_Lock to mod2;
</li>
<li> swap the keycodes assigned to F12 and Num_Lock;
</li>
<li> assign Num_Lock back to mod2.
</li>
</ol>

<p>The <samp>.xmodmaprc</samp> file looks like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">! File:  .xmodmaprc
!
! Set up PC keypad under GNU/Linux for the Emacs EDT Emulation
!
clear  mod2
keycode  77 = F12
keycode  96 = Num_Lock Pointer_EnableKeys
add mod2 = Num_Lock
</pre>
</div>

<p>So, after executing ‘<samp>xmodmap .xmodmaprc</samp>’, a press of the physical
<tt class="key">F12</tt> key looks like a Num_Lock keypress to X.  Also, a press of the
physical <tt class="key">NumLock</tt> key looks like a press of the <tt class="key">F12</tt> key to X.
</p>
<p>Now, <samp>edt-mapper.el</samp> will see ‘<samp>f12</samp>’ when the physical
<tt class="key">NumLock</tt> key is pressed, allowing the <tt class="key">NumLock</tt> key to be used
as the EDT <tt class="key">PF1</tt> (<tt class="key">GOLD</tt>) key.

<a name="How-Does-this-EDT-Emulation-Differ-from-Real-EDT_003f"></a>
<h2 class="chapter">5 How Does this EDT Emulation Differ from Real EDT?</h2>

<p>In general, you will find that this emulation of EDT replicates most,
but not all, of EDT’s most used Keypad Mode editing functions and
behavior.  It is not perfect, but most EDT users who have tried the
emulation agree that it is quite good enough to make it easy for
die-hard EDT users to move over to using Emacs.
</p>
<p>Here’s a list of the most important differences between EDT and this GNU
Emacs EDT Emulation.  The list is short but you must be aware of these
differences if you are to use the EDT Emulation effectively.
</p>
<ol>
<li> Entering repeat counts works a little differently than in EDT.

<p>EDT allows users to enter a repeat count before entering a command that
accepts repeat counts.  For example, when using the real EDT, pressing
these three keys in sequence, <kbd>GOLD 5 KP1</kbd>, will move the cursor in
the current direction 5 words.  This does <strong>not</strong> work in Emacs!
</p>
<p>Emacs provides two ways to enter repeat counts and neither involves
using the <tt class="key">GOLD</tt> key.  First, repeat counts can be entered in Emacs
by using the <tt class="key">ESC</tt> key.  For example, pressing these keys in
sequence, <kbd>ESC 1 0 KP1</kbd>, will move the cursor in the current
direction 10 words.  Second, Emacs provides another command called
<code>universal-argument</code> that can be used to do the same thing.
Normally, in Emacs has this bound to <kbd>C-u</kbd>.
</p>
</li>
<li> EDT’s line mode commands and nokeypad mode commands are <strong>not</strong>
supported (with one important exception; see item 8 in
<a href="#Highlights">Highlights</a>).  Although, at first, this may seem like a big
omission, the set of built-in Emacs commands provides a much richer set
of capabilities which more than make up for this omission.

<p>To enter Emacs commands not bound to keys, you can press <kbd>GOLD KP7</kbd>
or the <tt class="key">DO</tt> key.  Emacs will display its own command prompt "M-x".
This stands for the keypress <kbd>Meta-x</kbd>, where <tt class="key">Meta</tt> is a special
shift key.  The <tt class="key">Alt</tt> key is often mapped to behave as a <tt class="key">Meta</tt>
key.  So, you can also invoke this prompt by pressing <kbd>Meta-x</kbd>.
Typing the sequence <kbd>ESC x</kbd> will also invoke the prompt.
</p>
</li>
<li> Selected text is highlighted <strong>only</strong> on systems where Emacs
supports the highlighting of text.

</li>
<li> Just like in TPU/EVE, the <tt class="key">ENTER</tt> key is <strong>not</strong> used to
terminate input when the editor prompts you for input.  The <tt class="key">RETURN</tt>
key is used, instead.  (<tt class="key">KP4</tt> and <tt class="key">KP5</tt> (the direction keys) do
terminate input for the ‘<samp>FIND</samp>’ command, just like in EDT, however.)

</li>
</ol>

<a name="Some-Highlights_002c-and-Comparisons-to-the-Original-Emacs-EDT-Emulation"></a>
<h2 class="chapter">6 Some Highlights, and Comparisons to the Original Emacs EDT Emulation</h2>

<ol>
<li> The EDT define key command is supported (<code>edt-define-key</code>) and is
bound to <kbd>C-k</kbd> in the default EDT mode when EDT control sequence
bindings are enabled, or when the sample <samp>edt-user.el</samp>
customization file is used.  The TPU/EVE learn command is supported but
not bound to a key in the default EDT mode but is bound in the sample
<samp>edt-user.el</samp> file.

<p>Unlike the TPU/EVE learn command, which uses one key to begin the learn
sequence, <kbd>C-l</kbd>, and another command to remember the sequence,
<kbd>C-r</kbd>, this version of the learn command (<code>edt-learn</code>) serves
as a toggle to both begin and to remember the learn sequence.
</p>
<p>Many users who change the meaning of a key with the define key and the
learn commands, would like to be able to restore the original key
binding without having to quit and restart emacs.  So a restore key
command is provided to do just that.  When invoked, it prompts you to
press the key to which you wish the last replaced key definition
restored.  It is bound to <kbd>GOLD C-k</kbd> in the default EDT mode when
EDT control sequence bindings are enabled or the sample
<samp>edt-user.el</samp> customization file is used.
</p>
</li>
<li> Direction support is fully supported.

</li>
<li> All original Emacs bindings are fully restored when EDT emulation is
turned off.  So, if a fellow worker comes over to your terminal to help
you with a software problem, for example, and is completely confused by
your EDT emulation bindings, just enter the command,
<code>edt-emulation-off</code>, at the ‘<samp>M-x</samp>’ prompt and the original
Emacs bindings will be restored.  To resume the EDT emulation, just
enter <code>edt-emulation-on</code>.

</li>
<li> User custom EDT bindings are kept separate from the default EDT
bindings.  One can toggle back and forth between the custom EDT bindings
and default EDT bindings.

</li>
<li> The Emacs functions in <samp>edt.el</samp> attempt to emulate, where
practical, the exact behavior of the corresponding EDT keypad mode
commands.  In a few cases, the emulation is not exact, but we hope you
will agree it is close enough.  In a very few cases, we chose to use the
Emacs way of handling things.  As mentioned earlier, we do not emulate
the EDT ‘<samp>SUBS</samp>’ command.  Instead, we chose to use the Emacs
<code>query-replace</code> function, which we find to be easier to use.

</li>
<li> Emacs uses the regexp assigned to <code>page-delimiter</code> to determine
what marks a page break.  This is normally ‘<samp>^\f</samp>’, which causes the
<code>edt-page</code> command to ignore form feeds not located at the
beginning of a line.  To emulate the EDT ‘<samp>PAGE</samp>’ command exactly,
page-delimiter is set to ‘<samp>\f</samp>’ when EDT emulation is turned on, and
restored to ‘<samp>^\f</samp>’ when EDT emulation is turned off.  But, since
some users prefer the Emacs definition of a page break, or may wish to
preserve a customized definition of page break, one can override the EDT
definition by placing

<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(setq edt-keep-current-page-delimiter t)
</pre>
</div>

<p>in your <samp>.emacs</samp> file.  Or, you can used the Emacs customize
command to change its setting.
</p>
</li>
<li> The EDT definition of a section of a terminal window is hardwired to be
16 lines of its one-and-only 24-line window (the EDT ‘<samp>SECT</samp>’ command
bound to <tt class="key">KP8</tt>).  That’s two-thirds of the window at a time.  Since
Emacs, like TPU/EVE, can handle multiple windows of sizes of other than
24 lines, the definition of section used here has been modified to
two-thirds of the current window.  (There is also an
<code>edt-scroll-window</code> function which you may prefer over the
‘<samp>SECT</samp>’ emulation.)

</li>
<li> Cursor movement and deletion involving word entities is identical to
EDT.  This, above all else, gives the die-hard EDT user a sense of being
at home.  Also, an emulation of EDT’s ‘<samp>SET ENTITY WORD</samp>’ command is
provided, for those users who like to customize movement by a word at a
time to their own liking.

</li>
<li> EDT’s ‘<samp>FIND</samp>’ and ‘<samp>FNDNXT</samp>’ are supported.

</li>
<li> EDT’s ‘<samp>APPEND</samp>’, ‘<samp>REPLACE</samp>’, and ‘<samp>SUBS</samp>’ commands are supported.

</li>
<li> ‘<samp>CHNGCASE</samp>’ is supported.  It works on individual characters or
selected text, if ‘<samp>SELECT</samp>’ is active.  In addition, two new
commands are provided: <code>edt-lowercase</code> and <code>edt-uppercase</code>.
They work on individual <strong>words</strong> or selected text, if
‘<samp>SELECT</samp>’ is active.

</li>
<li> Form feed and tab insert commands are supported.

</li>
<li> A new command, <code>edt-duplicate-word</code>, is provided.  If you
experiment with it, you might find it to be surprisingly useful and may
wonder how you ever got along without it!  It is assigned to <kbd>C-j</kbd>
in the sample <samp>edt-user.el</samp> customization file.

</li>
<li> TPU/EVE’s Rectangular Cut and Paste functions (originally from the
EVE-Plus package) are supported.  But unlike the TPU/EVE versions, these
here support both insert and overwrite modes.  The seven rectangular
functions are bound to <tt class="key">F7</tt>, <tt class="key">F8</tt>, <kbd>GOLD-F8</kbd>, <tt class="key">F9</tt>,
<kbd>GOLD-F9</kbd>, <tt class="key">F10</tt>, and <kbd>GOLD-F10</kbd> in the default EDT mode.

</li>
<li> The original EDT emulation package set up many default regular and GOLD
bindings.  We tried to preserve most (but not all!) of these, so users
of the original emulation package will feel more at home.

<p>Nevertheless, there are still many GOLD key sequences which are not
bound to any functions.  These are prime candidates to use for your own
customizations.
</p>
<p>Also, there are several commands in <samp>edt.el</samp> not bound to any key.
So, you will find it worthwhile to look through <samp>edt.el</samp> for
functions you may wish to add to your personal customized bindings.
</p>
</li>
<li> The VT200/VT300 series terminals steal the function keys <tt class="key">F1</tt> to
<tt class="key">F5</tt> for their own use.  These do not generate signals which are
sent to the host.  So, <samp>edt.el</samp> does not assign any default
bindings to <tt class="key">F1</tt> through <tt class="key">F5</tt>.

<p>In addition, our VT220 terminals generate an interrupt when the <tt class="key">F6</tt>
key is pressed (‘<samp>^C</samp>’ or ‘<samp>^Y</samp>’, can’t remember which) and not
the character sequence documented in the manual.  So, binding Emacs
commands to <tt class="key">F6</tt> will not work if your terminal behaves the same
way.
</p>
</li>
<li> The VT220 terminal has no <tt class="key">ESC</tt>, <tt class="key">BS</tt>, nor <tt class="key">LF</tt> keys, as
does a VT100.  So the default EDT bindings adopt the standard DEC
convention of having the <tt class="key">F11</tt>, <tt class="key">F12</tt>, and <tt class="key">F13</tt> keys, on a
VT200 series (and above) terminal, assigned to the same EDT functions
that are bound to <tt class="key">ESC</tt>, <tt class="key">BS</tt>, and <tt class="key">LF</tt> on a VT100 terminal.

</li>
<li> Each user, through the use of a private <samp>edt-user.el</samp> file, can
customize, very easily, personal EDT emulation bindings.

</li>
<li> The EDT ‘<samp>SELECT</samp>’ and ‘<samp>RESET</samp>’ functions are supported.
However, unlike EDT, pressing ‘<samp>RESET</samp>’ to cancel text selection does
<strong>not</strong> reset the existing setting of the current direction.

<p>We also provide a TPU/EVE like version of the single ‘<samp>SELECT/RESET</samp>’
function, called <code>edt-toggle-select</code>, which makes the EDT
‘<samp>SELECT</samp>’ function into a toggle on/off switch.  That is, if
selection is on, pressing ‘<samp>SELECT</samp>’ again turns selection off
(cancels selection).  This function is used in the sample
<samp>edt-user.el</samp> customization file.
</p>
</li>
<li> EDT scroll margins are supported, but are disabled by default.
(<a href="#Scroll-margins">Scroll margins</a> for instructions on how to enable them.)

<h2 class="chapter">7 Customizing Emulation</h2>

<p>Most EDT users, at one time or another, make some custom key bindings,
or use someone else’s custom key bindings, which they come to depend
upon just as if they were built-in bindings.  This EDT Emulation for GNU
Emacs is designed to make it easy to customize bindings.
</p>
<p>If you wish to customize the EDT Emulation to use some of your own key
bindings, you need to make a private version of <samp>edt-user.el</samp> in
your own private lisp directory.  The Emacs <samp>etc/</samp> directory
contains an example for you to use as a template and for ideas.
</p>
<p>First, you need to have your own private lisp directory, say
<samp>~/lisp</samp>, and you should add it to the Emacs load path.
</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> A few sites have different load-path requirements,
so the above directions may need some modification if your site has such
special needs.

bindings: <code>edt-bind-key</code>, <code>edt-bind-gold-key</code>, and
<code>edt-bind-function-key</code>.
</p>
<p>The first two are for binding functions to keys which are standard
across most keyboards.  This makes them keyboard independent, making it
possible to define these key bindings for all terminals in the file
<samp>edt.el</samp>.
</p>
<p>The first, <code>edt-bind-key</code>, is used typically to bind emacs commands
to control keys, although some people use it to bind commands to other
keys, as well.  (For example, some people use it to bind the VT200
seldom used back-tick key (‘<samp>`</samp>’) to the function ‘<samp>ESC-prefix</samp>’
so it will behave like an <tt class="key">ESC</tt> key.)  The second function,
<code>edt-bind-gold-key</code>, is used to bind emacs commands to gold key
sequences involving alpha-numeric keys, special character keys, and
control keys.
</p>
<p>The third function, <code>edt-bind-function-key</code>, is terminal dependent
and is defined in a terminal specific file (see <samp>edt-vt100.el</samp> for
example).  It is used to bind emacs commands to LK-201 function keys, to
keypad keys, and to gold sequences of those keys.

<h3 class="section">7.2 Specifying Word Entities</h3>

<p>The variable <code>edt-word-entities</code> is used to emulate EDT’s ‘<samp>SET
ENTITY WORD</samp>’ command.  It contains a list of characters to be treated as
words in themselves.  If the user does not define
<code>edt-word-entities</code> in his/her <samp>.emacs</samp> file, then it is set
up with the EDT default containing only <tt class="key">TAB</tt>.
</p>
<p>The characters are stored in the list by their numerical values, not as
strings.  Emacs supports several ways to specify the numerical value of
a character.  One method is to use the question mark: ‘<samp>?A</samp>’ means
the numerical value for ‘<samp>A</samp>’, ‘<samp>?/</samp>’ means the numerical value
for ‘<samp>/</samp>’, and so on.  Several unprintable characters have special
representations:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">?\b  specifies  BS, C-h
?\t  specifies  TAB, C-i
?\n  specifies  LFD, C-j
?\v  specifies  VTAB, C-k
?\f  specifies  FF, C-l
?\r  specifies  CR, C-m
?\e  specifies  ESC, C-[
?\\  specifies  \
</pre>
</div>

<p>Here are some examples:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(setq edt-word-entities '(?\t ?- ?/)) ; specifies TAB, - , and /
(setq edt-word-entities '(?\t)        ; specifies TAB, the default
</pre>
</div>

<p>You can also specify characters by their decimal ascii values:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(setq edt-word-entities '(9 45 47))   ; specifies TAB, - , and /
</pre>

<a name="Enabling-EDT-Control-Key-Sequence-Bindings"></a>
<h3 class="section">7.3 Enabling EDT Control Key Sequence Bindings</h3>

<p>Where EDT key bindings and Emacs key bindings conflict, the default
Emacs key bindings are retained by default.  Some diehard EDT users
may not like this.  So, if the variable
<code>edt-use-EDT-control-key-bindings</code> is set to true in a user’s
<samp>.emacs</samp> file, then the default EDT Emulation mode will enable most
of the original EDT control key sequence bindings.  If you wish to do
this, add the following line to your <samp>.emacs</samp> file:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(setq edt-use-EDT-control-key-bindings t)
</pre>

<a name="Setting-Scroll-Margins"></a>
<h3 class="section">7.4 Setting Scroll Margins</h3>

<p>Scroll margins at the top and bottom of the window are now supported.
(The design was copied from <samp>tpu-extras.el</samp>.)  By default, this
feature is enabled with the top margin set to 10% of the window and the
bottom margin set to 15% of the window.  To change these settings, you
can invoke the function <code>edt-set-scroll-margins</code> in your
<samp>.emacs</samp> file.  For example, the following line
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(edt-set-scroll-margins "20%" "25%")
</pre>
</div>

<p>sets the top margin to 20% of the window and the bottom margin
to 25% of the window.  To disable this feature, set each margin to 0%.
You can also invoke <code>edt-set-scroll-margins</code> interactively while
EDT Emulation is active to change the settings for that session.
</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Another way to set the scroll margins is to use
the Emacs customization feature to set the following two variables
directly: <code>edt-top-scroll-margin</code> and <code>edt-bottom-scroll-margin</code>.
</p>
<p>Enter the Emacs <code>customize</code> command.  First select the
‘<samp>Editing</samp>’ group and then select the ‘<samp>Emulations</samp>’ group.
Finally, select the ‘<samp>Edt</samp>’ group and follow the directions.

<a href="https://fsf.org/">https://fsf.org/</a>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>
</div>

<ol start="0">
<li> PREAMBLE

<p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <em>free</em> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.
</p>
<p>This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.
</p>
<p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
</p>
</li>
<li> APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

<p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The “Document”, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as “you”.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.
</p>
<p>A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.
</p>
<p>A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.
</p>
<p>The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.
</p>
<p>The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
</p>
<p>A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.
</p>
<p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, SGML or XML using a publicly available
DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and
JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.
</p>
<p>The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title Page” means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
</p>
<p>The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.
</p>
<p>A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as “Acknowledgements”,
“Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)  To “Preserve the Title”
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section “Entitled XYZ” according to this definition.
</p>
<p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.
</p>
</li>
<li> VERBATIM COPYING

<p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
</p>
<p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.
</p>
</li>
<li> COPYING IN QUANTITY

<p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.
</p>
<p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.
</p>
<p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.
</p>
<p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
</p>
</li>
<li> MODIFICATIONS

<p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
</p>
<ol type="A" start="1">
<li> Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

</li>
<li> List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

</li>
<li> State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

</li>
<li> Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

</li>
<li> Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

</li>
<li> Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

</li>
<li> Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s license notice.

</li>
<li> Include an unaltered copy of this License.

</li>
<li> Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled “History” in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

</li>
<li> Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the “History” section.
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

</li>
<li> For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

</li>
<li> Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

</li>
<li> Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

</li>
<li> Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled “Endorsements” or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

</li>
<li> Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
</li>
</ol>

<p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
</p>
<p>You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.
</p>
<p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
</p>
<p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
</p>
</li>
<li> COMBINING DOCUMENTS

<p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
</p>
<p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
</p>
<p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled “History”
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
“History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You must delete all
sections Entitled “Endorsements.”
</p>
</li>
<li> COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

<p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
</p>
<p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
</p>
</li>
<li> AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

<p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.
</p>
<p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.
</p>
</li>
<li> TRANSLATION

<p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
</p>
<p>If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
“Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.
</p>
</li>
<li> TERMINATION

<p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
</p>
<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.
</p>
<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.
</p>
<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.
</p>
</li>
<li> FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a>.
</p>
<p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.
</p>
</li>
<li> RELICENSING

<p>“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.
</p>
<p>“CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.
</p>
<p>“Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.
</p>
<p>An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.
</p>
<p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

<a name="ADDENDUM_003a-How-to-use-this-License-for-your-documents"></a>
<h3 class="heading">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">  Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
  Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
  under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
  or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
  with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
  Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
  Free Documentation License''.
</pre>
</div>

<p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the “with…Texts.” line with this:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">    with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
    the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
    being <var>list</var>.
</pre>
</div>

<p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.
</p>
<p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
