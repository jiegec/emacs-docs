<h2 class="chapter">1 Overview</h2>

<p><a name="index-overview-1"></a>
This document describes a set of features that can interactively do
things with buffers and files.  All the features are described here
in detail.

   </p>
<p>The <dfn>Ido</dfn> package can let you switch between buffers and visit
files and directories with a minimum of keystrokes.  It is a superset
of Iswitchb, the interactive buffer switching package by Stephen
Eglen.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-author-of-Ido-2"></a><a name="index-Iswitchb-3"></a>This package was originally written by Kim F. Storm, based on the
 <samp><span class="file">iswitchb.el</span></samp> package by Stephen Eglen.

<h3 class="section">1.1 Activation</h3>

<p><a name="index-activation-4"></a><a name="index-installation-5"></a>
This package is distributed with Emacs, so there is no need to install
any additional files in order to start using it.  To activate, use
<kbd>M-x ido-mode</kbd>.

</p>
<p class="noindent">You may wish to add the following expressions to your initialization
file (see <a href="emacs.html#Init-File">The Emacs Initialization File</a>), if you make frequent use of features from this
package.

<p><a name="index-working-directories-6"></a>
<a name="index-ido_002dwork_002ddirectory_002dlist-7"></a><dfn>Working directories</dfn> are directories where files have most
recently been opened.  The current directory is inserted at the front
of this <code>ido-work-directory-list</code> whenever a file is opened with
<code>ido-find-file</code> and other file-related functions.

<h3 class="section">2.1 Interactive Substring Matching</h3>

<p><a name="index-interactive-substring-matching-11"></a><a name="index-substring_002c-interactive-matching-12"></a><a name="index-matching_002c-using-substring-13"></a>
As you type in a substring, the list of buffers or files currently
matching the substring are displayed as you type.  The list is
ordered so that the most recent buffers or files visited come at
the start of the list.

   </p>
<p>The buffer or file at the start of the list will be the one visited
when you press &lt;RET&gt;.  By typing more of the substring, the list
is narrowed down so that gradually the buffer or file you want will be
at the top of the list.  Alternatively, you can use <kbd>C-s</kbd> and
<kbd>C-r</kbd> (or the right and left arrow keys) to rotate buffer or file
names in the list until the one you want is at the top of the list.

   </p>
<p>Completion is also available so that you can see what is common to
all of the matching buffers or files as you type.

   </p>
<p>For example, if there are two buffers called <samp><span class="file">123456</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">123</span></samp>, with <samp><span class="file">123456</span></samp> the most recent, when using
<code>ido-switch-buffer</code>, you first of all get presented with the list
of all the buffers

</p>
<pre class="example">     Buffer: {123456 | 123}
</pre>
   <p>If you then press <kbd>2</kbd>:

</p>
<pre class="example">     Buffer: 2[3]{123456 | 123}
</pre>
   <p>The list in {...} are the matching buffers, most recent first
(buffers visible in the current frame are put at the end of the list
by default).  At any time you can select the item at the head of the
list by pressing &lt;RET&gt;.  You can also put the first element at the
end of the list by pressing <kbd>C-s</kbd> or <kbd>&lt;right&gt;</kbd>, or bring the
last element to the head of the list by pressing <kbd>C-r</kbd> or
<kbd>&lt;left&gt;</kbd>.

   </p>
<p>The item in [...] indicates what can be added to your input by
pressing &lt;TAB&gt; (<code>ido-complete</code>).  In this case, you will get
"3" added to your input.

   </p>
<p>So, press &lt;TAB&gt;:

</p>
<pre class="example">     Buffer: 23{123456 | 123}
</pre>
   <p>At this point, you still have two matching buffers.  If you want the
first buffer in the list, you can simply press &lt;RET&gt;.  If you want
the second in the list, you can press <kbd>C-s</kbd> to move it to the top
of the list and then press &lt;RET&gt; to select it.

   </p>
<p>However, if you type <kbd>4</kbd>, you'll only have one match left:

</p>
<pre class="example">     Buffer: 234[123456]
</pre>
   <p>Since there is only one matching buffer left, it is given in [] and it
is shown in the <code>ido-only-match</code> face (ForestGreen).  You can now
press &lt;TAB&gt; or &lt;RET&gt; to go to that buffer.

   </p>
<p>If you want to create a new buffer named <samp><span class="file">234</span></samp>, you can press
<kbd>C-j</kbd> (<code>ido-select-text</code>) instead of &lt;TAB&gt; or &lt;RET&gt;.

   </p>
<p>If instead, you type <kbd>a</kbd>:

</p>
<pre class="example">     Buffer: 234a [No match]
</pre>
   <p>There are no matching buffers.  If you press &lt;RET&gt; or &lt;TAB&gt;,
you can be prompted to create a new buffer called <samp><span class="file">234a</span></samp>.

   </p>
<p>Of course, where this function comes in really useful is when you can
specify the buffer using only a few keystrokes.  In the above example,
the quickest way to get to the <samp><span class="file">123456</span></samp> file would be just to
type <kbd>4</kbd> and then &lt;RET&gt; (assuming there isn't any newer buffer
with <kbd>4</kbd> in its name).

   </p>
<p>Likewise, if you use <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> (<code>ido-find-file</code>), the list of
files and directories in the current directory is provided in the same
fashion as the buffers above.  The files and directories are normally
sorted in alphabetical order, but the most recently visited directory
is placed first to speed up navigating to directories that you have
visited recently.

   </p>
<p>In addition to scrolling through the list using <kbd>&lt;right&gt;</kbd> and
<kbd>&lt;left&gt;</kbd>, you can use <kbd>&lt;up&gt;</kbd> and <kbd>&lt;down&gt;</kbd> to quickly
scroll the list to the next or previous subdirectory.

   </p>
<p>To go down into a subdirectory, and continue the file selection on
the files in that directory, simply move the directory to the head
of the list and hit &lt;RET&gt;.

   </p>
<p>To go up to the parent directory, delete any partial file name already
specified (e.g., using &lt;DEL&gt;) and hit &lt;DEL&gt;.

<!-- @deffn Command ido-delete-backward-updir -->
</p>
<p><a name="index-root-directory-14"></a><a name="index-home-directory-15"></a>To go to the root directory (on the current drive), enter two slashes. 
On MS-DOS or Windows, to select the root of another drive, enter
`<samp><span class="samp">X:/</span></samp>' where `<samp><span class="samp">X</span></samp>' is the drive letter.  To go to the home
directory, enter `<samp><span class="samp">~/</span></samp>'.  To enter Dired for this directory, use
<kbd>C-d</kbd>.

<!-- TODO: a new node for ftp hosts -->
</p>
<p><a name="index-ftp-hosts-16"></a>You can also visit files on other hosts using the ange-ftp
notations `<samp><span class="samp">/host:</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">/user@host:</span></samp>'. 
<!-- @defopt ido-record-ftp-work-directories -->
<!-- @defopt ido-merge-ftp-work-directories -->
<!-- @defopt ido-cache-ftp-work-directory-time -->
<!-- @defopt ido-slow-ftp-hosts -->
<!-- @defopt ido-slow-ftp-host-regexps -->

   </p>
<p>You can type <kbd>M-p</kbd> and <kbd>M-n</kbd> to change to previous/next
directories from the history, <kbd>M-s</kbd> to search for a file matching
your input, and <kbd>M-k</kbd> to remove the current directory from the history.

   </p>
<p>If for some reason you cannot specify the proper file using
<code>ido-find-file</code>, you can press <kbd>C-f</kbd> to enter the normal
<code>find-file</code>.  You can also press <kbd>C-b</kbd> to drop into
<code>ido-switch-buffer</code>.

<!-- @kindex C-x b -->
<!-- @deffn Command ido-switch-buffer -->
<!-- This command switch to another buffer interactively. -->
<!-- @end deffn -->
<!-- @kindex C-x C-f -->
<!-- @deffn Command ido-find-file -->
<!-- Edit file with name obtained via minibuffer. -->
<!-- @end deffn -->
<!-- @kindex C-x d -->
<!-- @findex ido-dired -->
<!-- @deffn Command ido-dired -->
<!-- Call Dired the Ido way. -->
<!-- @end deffn -->

<h3 class="section">2.2 Prefix Matching</h3>

<p><a name="index-prefix-matching-17"></a><a name="index-matching_002c-using-prefix-18"></a><a name="index-standard-way-of-completion-19"></a>
The standard way of completion with *nix shells and Emacs is to insert
a <dfn>prefix</dfn> and then hitting &lt;TAB&gt; (or another completion key). 
Cause of this behavior has become second nature to a lot of Emacs
users Ido offers in addition to the default substring matching method
(look above) also the prefix matching method.  The kind of matching is
the only difference to the description of the substring matching
above.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-toggle-prefix-matching-20"></a>You can toggle prefix matching with <kbd>C-p</kbd>
(<code>ido-toggle-prefix</code>).

   </p>
<p>For example, if you have two buffers <samp><span class="file">123456</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">123</span></samp> then
hitting <kbd>2</kbd> does not match because <kbd>2</kbd> is not a prefix in any
of the buffer names.

</p>
<mbp:pagebreak></mbp:pagebreak><div class="node"><a name="Flexible-Matching"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">2.3 Flexible Matching</h3>

<p><a name="index-flexible-matching-21"></a>

</p>
<div class="defun">
— User Option: <b>ido-enable-flex-matching</b><var><a name="index-ido_002denable_002dflex_002dmatching-22"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If non-<code>nil</code>, Ido will do flexible string matching.  Flexible
matching means that if the entered string does not match any item, any
item containing the entered characters in the given sequence will
match. 
</p></blockquote>
</div>

<p class="noindent">If <code>ido-enable-flex-matching</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, Ido will do a
more flexible matching (unless regexp matching is active) to find
possible matches among the available buffer or file names if no
matches are found using the normal prefix or substring matching.

   </p>
<p>The flexible matching implies that any item which simply contains all
of the entered characters in the specified sequence will match.

   </p>
<p>For example, if you have four files <samp><span class="file">alpha</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">beta</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="file">gamma</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="file">delta</span></samp>, entering `<samp><span class="samp">aa</span></samp>' will match
<samp><span class="file">alpha</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">gamma</span></samp>, while `<samp><span class="samp">ea</span></samp>' matches <samp><span class="file">beta</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">delta</span></samp>.  If prefix matching is also active, `<samp><span class="samp">aa</span></samp>' only
matches <samp><span class="file">alpha</span></samp>, while `<samp><span class="samp">ea</span></samp>' does not match any files.

</p>
<mbp:pagebreak></mbp:pagebreak><div class="node"><a name="Regexp-Matching"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">2.4 Regular Expression Matching</h3>

<p><a name="index-regexp-matching-23"></a><a name="index-matching_002c-using-regular-expression-24"></a>
There is limited provision for regexp matching within Ido, enabled
through <code>ido-enable-regexp</code> (toggle with <kbd>C-t</kbd>).  This allows
you to type `<samp><span class="samp">[ch]$</span></samp>' for example and see all file names ending in
`<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">h</span></samp>'.

</p>
<div class="defun">
— User Option: <b>ido-enable-regexp</b><var><a name="index-ido_002denable_002dregexp-25"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If the value of this user option is non-<code>nil</code>, Ido will do regexp
matching.  The value of this user option can be toggled within
ido-mode using <code>ido-toggle-regexp</code>. 
</p></blockquote>
</div>

   <p><strong>Please notice:</strong> Ido-style completion is inhibited when you
enable regexp matching.

</p>
<mbp:pagebreak></mbp:pagebreak><div class="node"><a name="Highlighting"></a></div>

<h2 class="chapter">3 Highlighting</h2>

<p><a name="index-highlighting-26"></a>
The highlighting of matching items is controlled via
<code>ido-use-faces</code>.  The faces used are <code>ido-first-match</code>,
<code>ido-only-match</code> and <code>ido-subdir</code>.

   </p>
<p>Coloring of the matching item was suggested by Carsten Dominik.

</p>
<mbp:pagebreak></mbp:pagebreak><div class="node"><a name="Hidden-Buffers-and-Files"></a></div>

<h2 class="chapter">4 Hidden Buffers and Files</h2>

<p><a name="index-hidden-buffers-and-files-27"></a>
Normally, Ido does not include hidden buffers (whose name starts with
a space) and hidden files and directories (whose name starts with
`<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>') in the list of possible completions.  However, if the
substring you enter does not match any of the visible buffers or
files, Ido will automatically look for completions among the hidden

You can customize the <code>ido</code> group to change Ido functionality:

</p>
<pre class="example">     M-x customize-group RET ido RET

   <p class="noindent">or customize a certain variable:

</p>
<pre class="example">     M-x customize-variable RET ido-xxxxx

   <p>To modify the keybindings, use the <code>ido-setup-hook</code>.  For example:

<h3 class="section">5.1 Changing List Order</h3>

<p><a name="index-changing-order-of-the-list-29"></a>
By default, the list of current files is most recent first,
oldest last, with the exception that the files visible in the
current frame are put at the end of the list.  A hook exists to
allow other functions to order the list.  For example, if you add:

</p>
<pre class="example">     (add-hook 'ido-make-buffer-list-hook 'ido-summary-buffers-to-end)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">then all files matching "Summary" are moved to the end of the list. 
(I find this handy for keeping the INBOX Summary and so on out of the
way.)  It also moves files matching `<samp><span class="samp">output\*$</span></samp>' to the end of the
list (these are created by AUCTeX when compiling.)  Other functions
could be made available which alter the list of matching files (either
deleting or rearranging elements.)

Find File At Point, also known generally as “ffap”, is an
intelligent system for opening files, and URLs.

   </p>
<p>The following expression will make Ido guess the context:

</p>
<pre class="example">     (setq ido-use-filename-at-point 'guess)

   <!-- @defopt ido-use-filename-at-point -->
<!-- If the value of this user option is non-@code{nil}, ... -->

<h3 class="section">5.3 Ignoring Buffers and Files</h3>

<p><a name="index-ignoring-33"></a><a name="index-regexp_002c-ignore-buffers-and-files-34"></a>
Ido is capable of ignoring buffers, directories, files and extensions
using regular expression.

</p></blockquote>
</div>

<!-- FIXME: Where to add this variable?  This node or ``working directory''? -->
<!-- @defopt ido-work-directory-list-ignore-regexps -->
<p>To make Ido use <code>completion-ignored-extensions</code> you need to
enable it:

</p>
<pre class="example">     (setq ido-ignore-extensions t)
</pre>
   <p>Now you can customize <code>completion-ignored-extensions</code> as well. 
Go ahead and add all the useless object files, backup files, shared
library files and other computing flotsam you don't want Ido to show.

   </p>
<p><strong>Please notice:</strong> Ido will still complete the ignored elements
if it would otherwise not show any other matches.  So if you type out
the name of an ignored file, Ido will still let you open it just fine.

After <kbd>C-x b</kbd> (<code>ido-switch-buffer</code>), the buffer at the head
of the list can be killed by pressing <kbd>C-k</kbd>.  If the buffer needs
saving, you will be queried before the buffer is killed.  <kbd>C-S-b</kbd>
buries the buffer at the head of the list.

   </p>
<p>Likewise, after <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>, you can delete (i.e., physically
remove) the file at the head of the list with <kbd>C-k</kbd>.  You will
always be asked for confirmation before deleting the file.

   </p>
<p>If you enter <kbd>C-x b</kbd> to switch to a buffer visiting a given file,
and you find that the file you are after is not in any buffer, you can
press <kbd>C-f</kbd> to immediately drop into <code>ido-find-file</code>.  And
you can switch back to buffer selection with <kbd>C-b</kbd>.

If you have many matching files, they may not all fit onto one line of
the minibuffer.  Normally, the minibuffer window will grow to show you
more of the matching files (depending on the value of the variables
<code>resize-mini-windows</code> and <code>max-mini-window-height</code>).  If you
want Ido to behave differently from the default minibuffer resizing
behavior, set the variable <code>ido-max-window-height</code>.

   </p>
<p>Also, to improve the responsiveness of Ido, the maximum number of
matching items is limited to 12, but you can increase or removed this
limit via the <code>ido-max-prospects</code> user option.

<!-- @defopt ido-max-prospects -->
</p>
<p>To see a full list of all matching buffers in a separate buffer, hit
<kbd>?</kbd> or press &lt;TAB&gt; when there are no further completions to
the substring.  Repeated &lt;TAB&gt; presses will scroll you through
this separate buffer.

<li>PREAMBLE

     <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <dfn>free</dfn> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. 
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

     </p>
<p>This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

     </p>
<p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

     </p>
</li>
<li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     <p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The “Document”, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as “you”.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

     </p>
<p>A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

     </p>
<p>A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

     </p>
<p>The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

     </p>
<p>The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

     </p>
<p>A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. 
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

     </p>
<p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, SGML or XML using a publicly available
DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and
JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

     </p>
<p>The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title Page” means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     </p>
<p>The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.

     </p>
<p>A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as “Acknowledgements”,
“Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)  To “Preserve the Title”
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section “Entitled XYZ” according to this definition.

     </p>
<p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

     </p>
</li>
<li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     </p>
<p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     </p>
</li>
<li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     </p>
<p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     </p>
<p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. 
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

     </p>
<p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     </p>
</li>
<li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

          </p>
<ol type="A" start="1">
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

          </li>
<li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

          </li>
<li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

          </li>
<li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

          </li>
<li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

          </li>
<li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

          </li>
<li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

          </li>
<li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

          </li>
<li>Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled “History” in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

          </li>
<li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the “History” section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

          </li>
<li>For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

          </li>
<li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

          </li>
<li>Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

          </li>
<li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled “Endorsements” or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

          </li>
<li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          </li>
</ol>

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     </p>
<p>You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     </p>
<p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     </p>
<p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     </p>
</li>
<li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

     </p>
<p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     </p>
<p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled “History”
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
“History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You must delete all
sections Entitled “Endorsements.”

     </p>
</li>
<li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     </p>
<p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     </p>
</li>
<li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. 
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

     </p>
<p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. 
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

     </p>
</li>
<li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     </p>
<p>If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
“Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

     </p>
</li>
<li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     </p>
<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

     </p>
<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

     </p>
<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

     </p>
</li>
<li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

     </p>
<p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

     </p>
</li>
<li>RELICENSING

     <p>“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.

     </p>
<p>“CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

     </p>
<p>“Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.

     </p>
<p>An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

     </p>
<p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

        </p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="heading">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">       Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the “with<small class="dots">...</small>Texts.” line with this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">         with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being <var>list</var>.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   </p>
<p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
