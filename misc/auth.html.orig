<h2 class="chapter">1 Overview</h2>

<p>The auth-source library is simply a way for Emacs and Gnus, among
others, to answer the old burning question &ldquo;What are my user name and
password?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>(This is different from the old question about burning &ldquo;Where is the
fire extinguisher, please?&rdquo;.)
</p>
<p>The auth-source library supports more than just the user name or the
password (known as the secret).
</p>
<p>Similarly, the auth-source library supports multiple storage backend,
currently either the classic &ldquo;netrc&rdquo; backend, examples of which you
can see later in this document, the Secret Service API, and pass, the
standard unix password manager.  This is done with EIEIO-based
backends and you can write your own if you want.

<h2 class="chapter">2 Help for users</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Netrc&rdquo; files are a de facto standard.  They look like this:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">machine <var>mymachine</var> login <var>myloginname</var> password <var>mypassword</var> port <var>myport</var>
</pre></div>

<p>The <code>machine</code> is the server (either a DNS name or an IP address).
It&rsquo;s known as <var>:host</var> in <code>auth-source-search</code> queries.  You
can also use <code>host</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code>port</code> is the connection port or protocol.  It&rsquo;s known as
<var>:port</var> in <code>auth-source-search</code> queries.
</p>
<p>The <code>user</code> is the user name.  It&rsquo;s known as <var>:user</var> in
<code>auth-source-search</code> queries.  You can also use <code>login</code> and
<code>account</code>.
</p>
<p>You can use spaces inside a password or other token by surrounding the
token with either single or double quotes.
</p>
<p>You can use apostrophes inside a password or other token by
surrounding it with double quotes, e.g., <code>&quot;he'llo&quot;</code>. Similarly you
can use double quotes inside a password or other token by surrounding
it with apostrophes, e.g., <code>'he&quot;llo'</code>. You can&rsquo;t mix both (so a
password or other token can&rsquo;t have both apostrophes and double quotes).
</p>
<p>All this is optional. You could just say (but we don&rsquo;t recommend it,
we&rsquo;re just showing that it&rsquo;s possible)
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">password <var>mypassword</var>
</pre></div>

<p>to use the same password everywhere.  Again, <em>DO NOT DO THIS</em> or
you will be pwned as the kids say.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Netrc&rdquo; files are usually called <samp>.authinfo</samp> or <samp>.netrc</samp>;
nowadays <samp>.authinfo</samp> seems to be more popular and the auth-source
library encourages this confusion by accepting both, as you&rsquo;ll see
later.
</p>
<p>If you have problems with the search, set <code>auth-source-debug</code> to
<code>'trivia</code> and see what host, port, and user the library is
checking in the <samp>*Messages*</samp> buffer.  Ditto for any other
problems, your first step is always to see what&rsquo;s being checked.  The
second step, of course, is to write a blog entry about it and wait for
the answer in the comments.
</p>
<p>You can customize the variable <code>auth-sources</code>.  The following may
be needed if you are using an older version of Emacs or if the
auth-source library is not loaded for some other reason.
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(require 'auth-source)             ;; probably not necessary
(customize-variable 'auth-sources) ;; optional, do it once
</pre></div>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-auth_002dsources"></a>Variable: <strong>auth-sources</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The <code>auth-sources</code> variable tells the auth-source library where
your netrc files, Secret Service API collection items, or your
password store live for a particular host and protocol.  While you can
get fancy, the default and simplest configuration is:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">;;; old default: required :host and :port, not needed anymore
(setq auth-sources '((:source &quot;~/.authinfo.gpg&quot; :host t :port t)))
;;; mostly equivalent (see below about fallbacks) but shorter:
(setq auth-sources '((:source &quot;~/.authinfo.gpg&quot;)))
;;; even shorter and the <em>default</em>:
(setq auth-sources '(&quot;~/.authinfo.gpg&quot; &quot;~/.authinfo&quot; &quot;~/.netrc&quot;))
;;; use the Secrets API <var>Login</var> collection
;;; (see <a href="#Secret-Service-API">Secret Service API</a>)
(setq auth-sources '(&quot;secrets:Login&quot;))
;;; use pass (<samp>~/.password-store</samp>)
;;; (see <a href="#The-Unix-password-store">The Unix password store</a>)
(setq auth-sources '(password-store))
</pre></div>

<p>By adding multiple entries to <code>auth-sources</code> with a particular
host or protocol, you can have specific netrc files for that host or
protocol.  Usually this is unnecessary but may make sense if you have
shared netrc files or some other unusual setup (90% of Emacs users
have unusual setups and the remaining 10% are <em>really</em> unusual).
</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a mixed example using two sources:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(setq auth-sources '((:source (:secrets default)
                      :host &quot;myserver&quot; :user &quot;joe&quot;)
                     &quot;~/.authinfo.gpg&quot;))
</pre></div>

</dd></dl>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t customize <code>auth-sources</code>, you&rsquo;ll have to live with
the defaults: the unencrypted netrc file <samp>~/.authinfo</samp> will be
used for any host and any port.
</p>
<p>If that fails, any host and any port are looked up in the netrc file
<samp>~/.authinfo.gpg</samp>, which is a GnuPG encrypted file (see <a href="#GnuPG-and-EasyPG-Assistant-Configuration">GnuPG and EasyPG Assistant Configuration</a>).
</p>
<p>Finally, the unencrypted netrc file <samp>~/.netrc</samp> will be used for
any host and any port.
</p>
<p>The typical netrc line example is without a port.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">machine YOURMACHINE login YOU password YOURPASSWORD
</pre></div>

<p>This will match any authentication port.  Simple, right?  But what if
there&rsquo;s a SMTP server on port 433 of that machine that needs a
different password from the IMAP server?
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">machine YOURMACHINE login YOU password SMTPPASSWORD port 433
machine YOURMACHINE login YOU password GENERALPASSWORD
</pre></div>

<p>For url-auth authentication (HTTP/HTTPS), you need to put this in your
netrc file:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">machine yourmachine.com:80 port http login testuser password testpass
</pre></div>

<p>This will match any realm and authentication method (basic or digest)
over HTTP.  HTTPS is set up similarly.  If you want finer controls,
explore the url-auth source code and variables.
</p>
<p>For Tramp authentication, use:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">machine yourmachine.com port scp login testuser password testpass
</pre></div>

<p>Note that the port denotes the Tramp connection method.  When you
don&rsquo;t use a port entry, you match any Tramp method, as explained
earlier.  Since Tramp has about 88 connection methods, this may be
necessary if you have an unusual (see earlier comment on those) setup.

<h2 class="chapter">3 Multiple GMail accounts with Gnus</h2>

<p>For multiple GMail accounts with Gnus, you have to make two nnimap
entries in your <code>gnus-secondary-select-methods</code> with distinct
names:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(setq gnus-secondary-select-methods '((nnimap &quot;gmail&quot;
                                         (nnimap-address &quot;imap.gmail.com&quot;))
                                      (nnimap &quot;gmail2&quot;
                                         (nnimap-address &quot;imap.gmail.com&quot;))))
</pre></div>

<p>Your netrc entries will then be:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">machine gmail login account@gmail.com password &quot;account password&quot; port imap
machine gmail2 login account2@gmail.com password &quot;account2 password&quot; port imap

<a name="Secret-Service-API-1"></a>
<h2 class="chapter">4 Secret Service API</h2>

<p>The <em>Secret Service API</em> is a standard from
<a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/secret-storage-spec">freedesktop.org</a>
to securely store passwords and other confidential information.  This
API is implemented by system daemons such as the GNOME Keyring and the
KDE Wallet (these are GNOME and KDE packages respectively and should
be available on most modern GNU/Linux systems).
</p>
<p>The auth-source library uses the <samp>secrets.el</samp> library to connect
through the Secret Service API.  You can also use that library in
other packages, it&rsquo;s not exclusive to auth-source.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-secrets_002denabled"></a>Variable: <strong>secrets-enabled</strong></dt>
<dd><p>After loading <samp>secrets.el</samp>, a non-<code>nil</code> value of this
variable indicates the existence of a daemon providing the Secret
Service API.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-secrets_002dshow_002dsecrets"></a>Command: <strong>secrets-show-secrets</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This command shows all collections, items, and their attributes.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>The atomic objects managed by the Secret Service API are <em>secret
items</em>, which contain things an application wishes to store securely,
like a password.  Secret items have a label (a name), the <em>secret</em>
(which is the string we want, like a password), and a set of lookup
attributes.  The attributes can be used to search and retrieve a
secret item at a later date.
</p>
<p>Secret items are grouped in <em>collections</em>.  A collection is
sometimes called a &lsquo;<samp>keyring</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>wallet</samp>&rsquo; in GNOME Keyring
and KDE Wallet but it&rsquo;s the same thing, a group of secrets.
Collections are personal and protected so only the owner can open them.
</p>
<p>The most common collection is called <code>&quot;login&quot;</code>.
</p>
<p>A collection can have an alias.  The alias <code>&quot;default&quot;</code> is
commonly used so the clients don&rsquo;t have to know the specific name of
the collection they open.  Other aliases are not supported yet.
Since aliases are globally accessible, set the <code>&quot;default&quot;</code> alias
only when you&rsquo;re sure it&rsquo;s appropriate.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-secrets_002dlist_002dcollections"></a>Function: <strong>secrets-list-collections</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This function returns all the collection names as a list.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-secrets_002dset_002dalias"></a>Function: <strong>secrets-set-alias</strong> <em>collection alias</em></dt>
<dd><p>Set <var>alias</var> as alias of collection labeled <var>collection</var>.
Currently only the alias <code>&quot;default&quot;</code> is supported.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-secrets_002dget_002dalias"></a>Function: <strong>secrets-get-alias</strong> <em>alias</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return the collection name <var>alias</var> is referencing to.
Currently only the alias <code>&quot;default&quot;</code> is supported.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>Collections can be created and deleted by the functions
<code>secrets-create-collection</code> and <code>secrets-delete-collection</code>.
Usually, this is not done from within Emacs.  Do not delete standard
collections such as <code>&quot;login&quot;</code>.
</p>
<p>The special collection <code>&quot;session&quot;</code> exists for the lifetime of the
corresponding client session (in our case, Emacs&rsquo;s lifetime).  It is
created automatically when Emacs uses the Secret Service interface and
it is deleted when Emacs is killed.  Therefore, it can be used to
store and retrieve secret items temporarily.  The <code>&quot;session&quot;</code>
collection is better than a persistent collection when the secret
items should not live longer than Emacs.  The session collection can
be specified either by the string <code>&quot;session&quot;</code>, or by <code>nil</code>,
whenever a collection parameter is needed in the following functions.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-secrets_002dlist_002ditems"></a>Function: <strong>secrets-list-items</strong> <em>collection</em></dt>

<p>The auth-source library uses the <samp>secrets.el</samp> library and thus
the Secret Service API when you specify a source matching
<code>&quot;secrets:COLLECTION&quot;</code>.  For instance, you could use
<code>&quot;secrets:session&quot;</code> to use the <code>&quot;session&quot;</code> collection, open only
for the lifetime of Emacs.  Or you could use <code>&quot;secrets:Login&quot;</code> to
open the <code>&quot;Login&quot;</code> collection.  As a special case, you can use the
symbol <code>default</code> in <code>auth-sources</code> (not a string, but a
symbol) to specify the <code>&quot;default&quot;</code> alias.  Here is a contrived
example that sets <code>auth-sources</code> to search three collections and
then fall back to <samp>~/.authinfo.gpg</samp>.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(setq auth-sources '(default
                     &quot;secrets:session&quot;
                     &quot;secrets:Login&quot;
                     &quot;~/.authinfo.gpg&quot;))

<h2 class="chapter">5 The Unix password store</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.passwordstore.org">The standard unix password
manager</a> (or just <code>pass</code>) stores your passwords in
<code>gpg</code>-protected files following the Unix philosophy.
</p>
<p>Emacs integration of <code>pass</code> follows the first approach suggested
by the pass project itself for data organization to find data. This
means that the filename of the file containing the password for a user
on a particular host must contain the host name.  The file itself must
contain the password on the first line, as well as a <code>username</code>
field containing the username on a subsequent line. A <code>port</code>
field can be used to differentiate the authentication data for several
services with the same username on the same host.
</p>
<p>Users of <code>pass</code> may also be interested in functionality provided
by other Emacs packages dealing with pass:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://git.zx2c4.com/password-store/tree/contrib/emacs/password-store.el">password-store</a>: library wrapping <code>pass</code>;
</li><li> <a href="https://github.com/NicolasPetton/pass">pass</a>: major mode to manipulate the store and edit entries;

<p>The auth-source library lets you control logging output easily.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-auth_002dsource_002ddebug"></a>Variable: <strong>auth-source-debug</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Set this variable to <code>'trivia</code> to see lots of output in
<samp>*Messages*</samp>, or set it to a function that behaves like
<code>message</code> to do your own logging.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>The auth-source library only has a few functions for external use.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-auth_002dsource_002dsearch"></a>Function: <strong>auth-source-search</strong> <em>&amp;rest spec &amp;key type max host user port secret require create delete &amp;allow-other-keys</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function searches (or modifies) authentication backends according
to <var>spec</var>.  See the function&rsquo;s doc-string for details.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at an example of using <code>auth-source-search</code>
from Gnus&rsquo;s <code>nnimap.el</code>.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(defun nnimap-credentials (address ports)
  (let* ((auth-source-creation-prompts
          '((user  . &quot;IMAP user at %h: &quot;)
            (secret . &quot;IMAP password for %u@%h: &quot;)))
         (found (nth 0 (auth-source-search :max 1
                                           :host address
                                           :port ports
                                           :require '(:user :secret)
                                           :create t))))
    (if found
        (list (plist-get found :user)
              (let ((secret (plist-get found :secret)))
                (if (functionp secret)
                    (funcall secret)
                  secret))
              (plist-get found :save-function))
      nil)))
</pre></div>

<p>This call requires the user and password (secret) to be in the
results.  It also requests that an entry be created if it doesn&rsquo;t
exist already.  While the created entry is being assembled, the shown
prompts will be used to interact with the user.  The caller can also
pass data in <code>auth-source-creation-defaults</code> to supply defaults
for any of the prompts.
</p>
<p>Note that the password needs to be evaluated if it&rsquo;s a function.  It&rsquo;s
wrapped in a function to provide some security.
</p>
<p>Later, after a successful login, <code>nnimap.el</code> calls the
<code>:save-function</code> like so:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(when (functionp (nth 2 credentials))
   (funcall (nth 2 credentials)))
</pre></div>

<p>This will work whether the <code>:save-function</code> was provided or not.
<code>:save-function</code> will be provided only when a new entry was
created, so this effectively says &ldquo;after a successful login, save the
authentication information we just used, if it was newly created.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>After the first time it&rsquo;s called, the <code>:save-function</code> will not
run again (but it will log something if you have set
<code>auth-source-debug</code> to <code>'trivia</code>).  This is so it won&rsquo;t ask
the same question again, which is annoying.  This is so it won&rsquo;t ask
the same question again, which is annoying.  This is so it won&rsquo;t ask
the same question again, which is annoying.
</p>
<p>So the responsibility of the API user that specified <code>:create t</code>
is to call the <code>:save-function</code> if it&rsquo;s provided.

<p>If the <code>auth-sources</code> variable contains <samp>~/.authinfo.gpg</samp>
before <samp>~/.authinfo</samp>, the auth-source library will try to
read the GnuPG encrypted <samp>.gpg</samp> file first, before
the unencrypted file.
</p>
<p>In Emacs 23 or later there is an option <code>auto-encryption-mode</code> to
automatically decrypt <samp>*.gpg</samp> files.  It is enabled by default.
If you are using earlier versions of Emacs, you will need:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(require 'epa-file)
(epa-file-enable)
</pre></div>

<p>If you want your GnuPG passwords to be cached, set up <code>gpg-agent</code>
or EasyPG Assistant
(see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/epa.html#Caching-Passphrases">(epa)Caching Passphrases</a>).
</p>
<p>To quick start, here are some questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Do you use GnuPG version 2 instead of GnuPG version 1?
</li><li> Do you use symmetric encryption rather than public key encryption?
</li><li> Do you want to use gpg-agent?
</li></ul>

<p>Here are configurations depending on your answers:
</p>
<table>
<tr><td><b>1</b></td><td><b>2</b></td><td><b>3</b></td><td>Configuration</td></tr>
<tr><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Set up gpg-agent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>You can&rsquo;t, without gpg-agent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>Set up gpg-agent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>You can&rsquo;t, without gpg-agent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Set up elisp passphrase cache.</td></tr>
<tr><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Set up elisp passphrase cache.</td></tr>
<tr><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>Set up gpg-agent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>You can&rsquo;t, without gpg-agent.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>To set up gpg-agent, follow the instruction in GnuPG manual
(see <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/Invoking-GPG_002dAGENT.html#Invoking-GPG_002dAGENT">(gnupg)Invoking GPG-AGENT</a>).
</p>
<p>To set up elisp passphrase cache, set
<code>epa-file-cache-passphrase-for-symmetric-encryption</code>.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

<li> PREAMBLE

<p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <em>free</em> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.
</p>
<p>This License is a kind of &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.
</p>
<p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
</p>
</li><li> APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

<p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The &ldquo;Document&rdquo;, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.
</p>
<p>A &ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.
</p>
<p>A &ldquo;Secondary Section&rdquo; is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document&rsquo;s overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
</p>
<p>A &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, SGML or XML using a publicly available
DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and
JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work&rsquo;s title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.
</p>
<p>A section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;.)  To &ldquo;Preserve the Title&rdquo;
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; according to this definition.
</p>
<p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.
</p>
</li><li> VERBATIM COPYING

<p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
</p>
<p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.
</p>
</li><li> COPYING IN QUANTITY

<p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document&rsquo;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.
</p>
<p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.
</p>
<p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.
</p>
<p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
</p>
</li><li> MODIFICATIONS

<p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
</p>
<ol type="A" start="1">
<li> Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

</li><li> List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

</li><li> State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

</li><li> Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

</li><li> Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

</li><li> Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

</li><li> Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document&rsquo;s license notice.

</li><li> Include an unaltered copy of this License.

</li><li> Preserve the section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

</li><li> Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section.
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

</li><li> For any section Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

</li><li> Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

</li><li> Delete any section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

</li><li> Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo; or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

</li><li> Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
</li></ol>

<p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&rsquo;s license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
</p>
<p>You may add a section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties&mdash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.
</p>
<p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
</p>
<p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
</p>
</li><li> COMBINING DOCUMENTS

<p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
</p>
<p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
</p>
<p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
and any sections Entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.  You must delete all
sections Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements.&rdquo;
</p>
</li><li> COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

<p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
</p>
<p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
</p>
</li><li> AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

<p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation&rsquo;s users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.
</p>
<p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document&rsquo;s Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.
</p>
</li><li> TRANSLATION

<p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
</p>
<p>If a section in the Document is Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.
</p>
</li><li> TERMINATION

<p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
</p>
<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.
</p>
<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.
</p>
<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.
</p>
</li><li> FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a>.
</p>
<p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy&rsquo;s public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.
</p>
</li><li> RELICENSING

<p>&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC Site&rdquo;) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC&rdquo;) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;CC-BY-SA&rdquo; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Incorporate&rdquo; means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.
</p>
<p>An MMC is &ldquo;eligible for relicensing&rdquo; if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.
</p>
<p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

<h3 class="heading">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">  Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
  Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
  under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
  or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
  with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
  Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
  Free Documentation License''.
</pre></div>

<p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the &ldquo;with&hellip;Texts.&rdquo; line with this:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">    with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
    the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
    being <var>list</var>.
</pre></div>

<p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.
</p>
<p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
