<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction</h2>

<p><a name="index-introduction-1"></a>
This version of WoMan should run with GNU Emacs 20.3 or later on any
platform.  It has not been tested, and may not run, with any other
version of Emacs.  It was developed primarily on various versions of
Microsoft Windows, but has also been tested on MS-DOS, and various
versions of UNIX and GNU/Linux.

<p>WoMan is distributed with GNU Emacs.

<p>WoMan implements a subset of the formatting performed by the Emacs
<code>man</code> (or <code>manual-entry</code>) command to format a Unix-style
<dfn>manual page</dfn> (usually abbreviated to <dfn>man page</dfn>) for display,
but without calling any external programs.  It is intended to emulate
the whole of the <code>roff -man</code> macro package, plus those <code>roff</code>
requests (see <a href="#Background">Background</a>) that are most commonly used
in man pages.  However, the emulation is modified to include the
reformatting done by the Emacs <code>man</code> command.  No hyphenation is
performed.

     <dl>
<dt><b>Advantages</b><dd>Much more direct, does not require any external programs.  Supports
completion on man page names. 
<br><dt><b>Disadvantages</b><dd>Not a complete emulation.  Currently no support for <code>eqn</code> or
<code>tbl</code>.  Slightly slower for large man pages (but usually faster for
small- and medium-size pages). 
</dl>

<p>This browser works quite well on simple well-written man files.  It
works less well on idiosyncratic files that &ldquo;break the rules&rdquo; or use
the more obscure <code>roff</code> requests directly.  Current test results
are available in the file
<a href="http://centaur.maths.qmw.ac.uk/Emacs/WoMan/files/woman.status"><samp><span class="file">woman.status</span></samp></a>.

<p>WoMan supports the use of compressed man files via
<code>auto-compression-mode</code> by turning it on if necessary.  But you may
need to adjust the user option <code>woman-file-compression-regexp</code>. 
See <a href="#Interface-Options">Interface Options</a>.

<p>Brief help on the WoMan interactive commands and user options, all of
which begin with the prefix <code>woman-</code> (or occasionally
<code>WoMan-</code>), is available most easily by loading WoMan and then
either running the command <code>woman-mini-help</code> or selecting the WoMan
menu option `<samp><span class="samp">Mini Help</span></samp>'.

<p>Guidance on reporting bugs is given below.  See <a href="#Bugs">Reporting Bugs</a>.

<h2 class="chapter">2 Background</h2>

<p><a name="index-background-2"></a>
WoMan is a browser for traditional Unix-style manual page documentation. 
Each such document is conventionally referred to as a <dfn>manual page</dfn>,
or <dfn>man page</dfn> for short, even though some are very much longer than
one page.  A man page is a document written using the Unix &ldquo;man&rdquo;
macros, which are themselves written in the nroff/troff text processing
markup language.  <code>nroff</code> and <code>troff</code> are text processors
originally written for the UNIX operating system by Joseph F. Ossanna at
Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, New Jersey, USA.  They are closely
related, and except in the few cases where the distinction between them
is important I will refer to them both ambiguously as <code>roff</code>.

<p><code>roff</code> markup consists of <dfn>requests</dfn> and <dfn>escape
sequences</dfn>.  A request occupies a complete line and begins with either a
period or an apostrophe.  An escape sequence is embedded
within the input text and begins (by default) with a backslash.  The
original man macro package defines 20 new <code>roff</code> requests
implemented as macros, which were considered to be sufficient for
writing man pages.  But whilst in principle man pages use only the man
macros, in practice a significant number use many other <code>roff</code>
requests.

<p>The distinction between <code>troff</code> and <code>nroff</code> is that
<code>troff</code> was designed to drive a phototypesetter whereas
<code>nroff</code> was designed to produce essentially <acronym>ASCII</acronym> output for a
character-based device similar to a teletypewriter (usually abbreviated
to &ldquo;teletype&rdquo; or &ldquo;tty&rdquo;).  Hence, <code>troff</code> supports much finer
control over output positioning than does <code>nroff</code> and can be seen
as a forerunner of TeX.  Traditionally, man pages are either
formatted by <code>troff</code> for typesetting or by <code>nroff</code> for
printing on a character printer or displaying on a screen.  Of course,
over the last 25 years or so, the distinction between typeset output on
paper and characters on a screen has become blurred by the fact that
most screens now support bit-mapped displays, so that any information
that can be printed can also be rendered on screen, the only difference
being the resolution.

<p>Nevertheless, Unix-style manual page documentation is still normally
browsed on screen by running a program called <code>man</code>.  This program
looks in a predefined set of directories for the man page matching a
specified topic, then either formats the source file by running
<code>nroff</code> or recovers a pre-formatted file, and displays it via a
pager such as <code>more</code>.  <code>nroff</code> normally formats for a printer,
so it paginates the output, numbers the pages, etc., most of which is
irrelevant when the document is browsed as a continuous scrollable
document on screen.  The only concession to on-screen browsing normally
implemented by the <code>man</code> program is to squeeze consecutive blank
lines into a single blank line.

<p>For some time, Emacs has offered an improved interface for browsing man
pages in the form of the Emacs <code>man</code> (or <code>manual-entry</code>)
command, see <a href="emacs.html#Documentation">man</a>. 
This command runs <code>man</code> as described above, perhaps in
the background, and then post-processes the output to remove much of the
<code>nroff</code> pagination such as page headers and footers, and places the
result into an Emacs buffer.  It puts this buffer into a special major
mode, which is tailored for man page browsing, and provides a number of
useful navigation commands, support for following references, etc.  It
provides some support for special display faces (fonts), but no special
menu or mouse support.  The Emacs man package appears to have been
developed over about 10 years, from the late 1980s to the late 1990s.

<p>There is considerable inefficiency in having <code>nroff</code> paginate a
document and then removing most of the pagination!

<p>WoMan is an Emacs Lisp library that provides an emulation of the
functionality of the Emacs <code>man</code> command, the main difference being
that WoMan does not use any external programs.  The only situation in
which WoMan might use an external program is when the source file is
compressed, when WoMan will use the standard Emacs automatic
decompression facility, which does call an external program.

<p>I began developing WoMan in the Spring of 1997 and the first version was
released in May 1997.  The original motivation for WoMan was the fact
that many GNU and Unix programs are ported to other platforms and come
with Unix-style manual page documentation.  This may be difficult to
read because ports of the Unix-style <code>man</code> program can be a little
awkward to set up.  I decided that it should not be too hard to emulate
the 20 <code>man</code> macros directly, without treating them as macros and
largely ignoring the underlying <code>roff</code> requests, given the text
processing capabilities of Emacs.  This proved to be essentially true,
and it did not take a great deal of work to be able to format simple man
pages acceptably.

<p>One problem arose with the significant number of man pages that use
<code>roff</code> requests in addition to the <code>man</code> macros, and since
releasing the first version of WoMan I have been continually extending
it to support more <code>roff</code> requests.  WoMan can now format a
significant proportion of the man pages that I have tested, either well
or at least readably.  However, I have added capabilities partly by
making additional passes through the document, a design that is
fundamentally flawed.  This can only be solved by a major re-design of
WoMan to handle the major formatting within a single recursive pass,
rather than the present multiple passes without any significant
recursion.  There are some <code>roff</code> requests that cannot be handled
satisfactorily within the present design.  Some of these are currently
handled by kludges that &ldquo;usually more or less work.&rdquo;

<p>The principle advantage of WoMan is that it does not require <code>man</code>,
and indeed the name WoMan is a contraction of &ldquo;without man.&rdquo;  But it
has other advantages.  It does not paginate the document, so it does not
need to un-paginate it again, thereby saving time.  It could take full
advantage of the display capabilities available to it, and I hope to
develop WoMan to take advantage of developments in Emacs itself.  At
present, WoMan uses several display faces to support bold and italic
text, to indicate other fonts, etc.  The default faces are also
colored, but the choice of faces is customizable.  WoMan provides menu
support for navigation and mouse support for following references, in
addition to the navigation facilities provided by <code>man</code> mode. 
WoMan has (this) texinfo documentation!

<p>WoMan <em>does not</em> replace <code>man</code>, although it does use a number
of the facilities implemented in the Emacs <code>man</code> library.  WoMan
and man can happily co-exist, which is very useful for comparison and
debugging purposes.

<h2 class="chapter">3 Finding and Formatting Man Pages</h2>

WoMan provides three user interfaces for finding and formatting man pages:

     <ul>
<li>a topic interface similar to that provided by the standard Emacs
<code>man</code> command;

     <li>a family of filename interfaces analogous to the standard Emacs
<code>view-file</code> command;

     <li>an automatic interface that detects the file type from its contents. 
(This is currently neither well tested, well supported nor recommended!) 
</ul>

<p>The topic and filename interfaces support completion in the usual way.

<p>The topic interface is generally the most convenient for regular use,
although it may require some special setup, especially if your machine
does not already have a conventional <code>man</code> installation (which
WoMan tries to detect).

<p>The simplest filename interface command <code>woman-find-file</code> can
always be used with no setup at all (provided WoMan is installed and
loaded or set up to autoload).

<p>The automatic interface always requires special setup.

<h3 class="heading">Case-Dependence of Filenames</h3>

<p><a name="index-case_002dsensitivity-9"></a><a name="index-w32_002ddowncase_002dfile_002dnames-10"></a>By default, WoMan ignores case in file pathnames only when it seems
appropriate.  Microsoft Windows users who want complete case
independence should set the special NTEmacs variable
<code>w32-downcase-file-names</code> to <code>t</code> and use all lower case when
setting WoMan file paths.

</div>

<h3 class="section">3.1 Topic Interface</h3>

<p><a name="index-topic-interface-11"></a>
The topic interface is accessed principally via the command
<code>woman</code>.  The same command can be accessed via the menu item
`<samp><span class="samp">Help-&gt;Manuals-&gt;Read Man Page (WoMan)...</span></samp>' once WoMan has been
loaded.  The command reads a manual topic in the minibuffer, which can
be the <dfn>basename</dfn> of a man file anywhere in the man file
structure.  The &ldquo;basename&rdquo; in this context means the filename
without any directory component and without any extension or suffix
components that relate to the file type.  So, for example, if there is
a compressed source file in Chapter 5 of the UNIX Programmer's Manual
with the full pathname <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/man/man5/man.conf.5.gz</span></samp> then
the topic is <code>man.conf</code>.  Provided WoMan is configured correctly,
this topic will appear among the completions offered by <code>woman</code>. 
If more than one file has the same topic name then WoMan will prompt
for which file to format.  Completion of topics is case insensitive.

<p>Clearly, <code>woman</code> has to know where to look for man files and there
are two customizable user options that store this information:
<code>woman-manpath</code> and <code>woman-path</code>.  See <a href="#Interface-Options">Interface Options</a>.  If <code>woman-manpath</code> is not set explicitly then
WoMan tries to pick up the information that would be used by the
<code>man</code> command, as follows.  If the environment variable
<code>MANPATH</code> is set, which seems to be the standard mechanism under
UNIX, then WoMan parses that.  Otherwise, if WoMan can find a
configuration file named (by default) <samp><span class="file">man.conf</span></samp> (or something very
similar), which seems to be the standard mechanism under GNU/Linux, then
it parses that.  To be precise, &ldquo;something very similar&rdquo; means
starting with `<samp><span class="samp">man</span></samp>' and ending with `<samp><span class="samp">.conf</span></samp>' and possibly more
lowercase letters, e.g., <samp><span class="file">manual.configuration</span></samp>. 
The search path and/or precise full path name for this file are set by
the value of the customizable user option <code>woman-man.conf-path</code>. 
If all else fails, WoMan uses a plausible default man search path.

<p>If the above default configuration does not work correctly for any
reason then simply customize the value of <code>woman-manpath</code>.  To
access man files that are not in a conventional man file hierarchy,
customize the value of <code>woman-path</code> to include the directories
containing the files.  In this way, <code>woman</code> can access manual files
<em>anywhere</em> in the entire file system.

<p>There are two differences between <code>woman-manpath</code> and
<code>woman-path</code>.  Firstly, the elements of <code>woman-manpath</code> must
be directories that contain <em>directories of</em> man files, whereas the
elements of <code>woman-path</code> must be directories that contain man files
<em>directly</em>.  Secondly, the last directory component of each element
of <code>woman-path</code> is treated as a regular (Emacs) match expression
rather than a fixed name, which allows collections of related
directories to be specified succinctly.  Also, elements of
<code>woman-manpath</code> can be conses, indicating a mapping from
`<samp><span class="samp">PATH</span></samp>' environment variable components to man directory
hierarchies.

<p>For topic completion to work, WoMan must build a list of all the manual
files that it can access, which can be very slow, especially if a
network is involved.  For this reason, it caches various amounts of
information, after which retrieving it from the cache is very fast.  If
the cache ever gets out of synchronism with reality, running the
<code>woman</code> command with a prefix argument (e.g., <kbd>C-u M-x woman</kbd>)
will force it to rebuild its cache.  This is necessary only if the names
or locations of any man files change; it is not necessary if only their
contents change.  It would always be necessary if such a change occurred
whilst Emacs were running and after WoMan has been loaded.  It may be
necessary if such a change occurs between Emacs sessions and persistent
caching is used, although WoMan can detect some changes that invalidate
its cache and rebuild it automatically.

<p>Customize the variable <code>woman-cache-filename</code> to save the cache
between Emacs sessions.  This is recommended only if the <code>woman</code>
command is too slow the first time it is run in an Emacs session, while
it builds its cache in main memory, which <em>may</em> be <em>very</em>
slow.  See <a href="#Cache">The WoMan Topic Cache</a>, for further details.

<h4 class="subsection">3.1.1 The WoMan Topic Cache</h4>

<p><a name="index-topic-cache-12"></a><a name="index-cache_002c-topic-13"></a>
The amount of information that WoMan caches (in main memory and,
optionally, saved to disc) is controlled by the user option
<code>woman-cache-level</code>.  There is a trade-off between the speed with
which WoMan can find a file and the size of the cache, and the default
setting gives a reasonable compromise.

<p>The <code>woman</code> command always performs a certain amount of caching in
main memory, but it can also write its cache to the filestore as a
persistent cache under control of the user option
<code>woman-cache-filename</code>.  If persistent caching is turned on then
WoMan re-loads its internal cache from the cache file almost
instantaneously, so that there is never any perceptible start-up delay
<em>except</em> when WoMan rebuilds its cache.  Persistent caching is
currently turned off by default.  This is because users with persistent
caching turned on may overlook the need to force WoMan to rebuild its
cache the first time they run it after they have installed new man
files; with persistent caching turned off, WoMan automatically rebuilds
its cache every time it is run in a new Emacs session.

<p>A prefix argument always causes the <code>woman</code> command (only) to
rebuild its topic cache, and to re-save it to
<code>woman-cache-filename</code> if this variable has a non-<code>nil</code> value.  This
is necessary if the <em>names</em> of any of the directories or files in
the paths specified by <code>woman-manpath</code> or <code>woman-path</code> change. 
If WoMan user options that affect the cache are changed then WoMan will
automatically update its cache file on disc (if one is in use) the next
time it is run in a new Emacs session.

<h4 class="subsection">3.1.2 Using the "Word at Point" as a Topic Suggestion</h4>

<p><a name="index-word-at-point-14"></a><a name="index-point_002c-word-at-15"></a>
By default, the <code>woman</code> command uses the word nearest to point in
the current buffer as a suggestion for the topic to look up, if it
exists as a valid topic.  The topic can be confirmed or edited in the
minibuffer.

<p>You can also bind the variable <code>woman-use-topic-at-point</code> locally
to a non-<code>nil</code> value (using <code>let</code>), in which case
<code>woman</code> will can use the suggested topic without confirmation if
possible.  This may be useful to provide special private key bindings,
e.g., this key binding for <kbd>C-c w</kbd> runs WoMan on the topic at
point without seeking confirmation:

<pre class="lisp">     (global-set-key "\C-cw"
                     (lambda ()
                       (interactive)
                       (let ((woman-use-topic-at-point t))

<h3 class="section">3.2 Filename Interface</h3>

<p><a name="index-filename-interface-16"></a>
The commands in this family are completely independent of the topic
interface, caching mechanism, etc.

<p><a name="index-woman_002dfind_002dfile-17"></a>The filename interface is accessed principally via the extended command
<code>woman-find-file</code>, which is available without any configuration at
all (provided WoMan is installed and loaded or set up to autoload). 
This command can be used to browse any accessible man file, regardless
of its filename or location.  If the file is compressed then automatic
file decompression must already be turned on (e.g., see the
`<samp><span class="samp">Help-&gt;Options</span></samp>' submenu)&mdash;it is turned on automatically only by
the <code>woman</code> topic interface.

<p><a name="index-woman_002ddired_002dfind_002dfile-18"></a>Once WoMan is loaded (or if specially set up), various additional
commands in this family are available.  In a dired buffer, the command
<code>woman-dired-find-file</code> allows the file on the same line as point
to be formatted and browsed by WoMan.  It is bound to the key <kbd>W</kbd> in
the dired mode map and added to the dired major mode menu.  It may also
be bound to <kbd>w</kbd>, unless this key is bound by another library, which
it is by <code>dired-x</code>, for example.  Because it is quite likely that
other libraries will extend the capabilities of such a commonly used
mode as dired, the precise key bindings added by WoMan to the dired mode
map are controlled by the user option <code>woman-dired-keys</code>.

<p><a name="index-woman_002dtar_002dextract_002dfile-19"></a>When a tar (Tape ARchive) file is visited in Emacs, it is opened in tar
mode, which parses the tar file and shows a dired-like view of its
contents.  The WoMan command <code>woman-tar-extract-file</code> allows the
file on the same line as point to be formatted and browsed by WoMan.  It
is bound to the key <kbd>w</kbd> in the tar mode map and added to the tar
major mode menu.

<p>The command <code>woman-reformat-last-file</code>, which is bound to the key
<kbd>R</kbd> in WoMan mode and available on the major mode menu, reformats
the last file formatted by WoMan.  This may occasionally be useful if
formatting parameters, such as the fill column, are changed, or perhaps
if the buffer is somehow corrupted.

<p><a name="index-woman_002ddecode_002dbuffer-20"></a>The command <code>woman-decode-buffer</code> can be used to decode and browse
the current buffer if it is visiting a man file, although it is
primarily used internally by WoMan.

<h3 class="section">3.3 Automatic Interface</h3>

<p><a name="index-automatic-interface-21"></a>
Emacs provides an interface to detect automatically the format of a file
and decode it when it is visited.  It is used primarily by the
facilities for editing rich (i.e., formatted) text, as a way to store
formatting information transparently as <acronym>ASCII</acronym> markup.  WoMan can in
principle use this interface, but it must be configured explicitly.

<p>This use of WoMan does not seem to be particularly advantageous, so it
is not really supported.  It originated during early experiments on how
best to implement WoMan, before I implemented the current topic
interface, and I subsequently stopped using it.  I might revive it as a
mechanism for storing pre-formatted WoMan files, somewhat analogous to
the standard Unix <code>catman</code> facility.  In the meantime, it exists
for anyone who wants to experiment with it.  Once it is set up it is
simply a question of visiting the file and there is no WoMan-specific
user interface!

<p>To use it, put something like this in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file.  [The
call to <code>set-visited-file-name</code> is to avoid font-locking triggered
by automatic major mode selection.]

<pre class="lisp">     (autoload 'woman-decode-region "woman")
     
     (add-to-list 'format-alist
                  '(man "Unix man-page source format" "\\.\\(TH\\|ig\\) "
                        woman-decode-region nil nil
                        (lambda (arg)
                          set-visited-file-name
                          (file-name-sans-extension buffer-file-name))))

<h2 class="chapter">4 Browsing Man Pages</h2>

<p><a name="index-using_002c-browsing-man-pages-22"></a><a name="index-browsing-man-pages-23"></a><a name="index-man-pages_002c-browsing-24"></a>
Once a man page has been found and formatted, WoMan provides a browsing
interface that is essentially the same as that provided by the standard
Emacs <code>man</code> command (and much of the code is inherited from the
<code>man</code> library, which WoMan currently requires).  Many WoMan
facilities can be accessed from the WoMan major mode menu as well as via
key bindings, etc.

<p>WoMan does not produce any page breaks or page numbers, and in fact does
not paginate the man page at all, since this is not appropriate for
continuous online browsing.  It produces a document header line that is
constructed from the standard man page header and footer.  Apart from
that, the appearance of the formatted man page should be almost
identical to what would be produced by <code>man</code>, with consecutive
blank lines squeezed to a single blank line.

<p><a name="index-fonts-25"></a><a name="index-faces-26"></a>
Fonts used by <code>roff</code> are handled by WoMan as faces, the details of
which are customizable.  See <a href="#Faces">Faces</a>.  WoMan supports both the
italic and bold fonts normally used in man pages, together with a single
face to represent all unknown fonts (which are occasionally used in
&ldquo;non-standard&rdquo; man pages, usually to represent a &ldquo;typewriter&rdquo; font)
and a face to indicate additional symbols introduced by WoMan.  This
currently means the characters ^ and _ used to indicate super- and
sub-scripts, which are not displayed well by WoMan.

<p><a name="index-navigation-27"></a>
Man (and hence WoMan) mode can be thought of as a superset of view mode. 
The buffer cannot be edited, so keys that would normally self-insert are
used for navigation.  The WoMan key bindings are a minor modification of
the <code>man</code> key bindings.

<h3 class="section">4.3 Following References</h3>

<p><a name="index-following-references-41"></a><a name="index-references-42"></a>
Man pages usually contain a &ldquo;SEE ALSO&rdquo; section containing references
to other man pages.  If these man pages are installed then WoMan can
easily be directed to follow the reference, i.e., to find and format the
man page.  When the mouse is passed over a correctly formatted reference
it is highlighted, in which case clicking the middle button
<kbd>mouse-2</kbd> will cause WoMan to follow the reference.  Alternatively,
when point is over such a reference the key &lt;RET&gt; will follow the
reference.

<p>Any word in the buffer can be used as a reference by clicking
<kbd>mouse-2</kbd> over it provided the Meta key is also used (although in
general such a &ldquo;reference&rdquo; will not lead to a man page). 
Alternatively, the key <kbd>r</kbd> allows completion to be used to select a
reference to follow, based on the word at point as default.

<h3 class="section">4.4 Changing the Current Man Page</h3>

<p><a name="index-changing-current-man-page-49"></a><a name="index-current-man-page_002c-changing-50"></a>
The man page currently being browsed by WoMan can be changed in several
ways.  The command <code>woman</code> can be invoked to format another man
page, or the current WoMan buffer can be buried or killed.  WoMan
maintains a ring of formatted man pages, and it is possible to move
forwards and backwards in this ring by moving to the next or previous
man page.  It is sometimes useful to reformat the current page, for
example after the right margin (the wrap column) or some other
formatting parameter has been changed.

<p>Buffers formatted by Man and WoMan are completely unrelated, even though
some of the commands to manipulate them are superficially the same (and
share code).

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>m</kbd><dd><a name="index-m-51"></a><a name="index-man-52"></a>Run the command <code>man</code> to get a Un*x manual page and put it in a

runs a Un*x command to retrieve and clean a man page in the background
and places the results in a Man mode (man page browsing) buffer.  If a
man buffer already exists for this man page, it will display
immediately.  This works exactly the same if WoMan is loaded, except
that the formatting time is displayed in the mini-buffer.

     <br><dt><kbd>w</kbd><dd><a name="index-w-53"></a><a name="index-woman-54"></a>Run the command <code>woman</code> exactly as if the extended command or menu

The WoMan menu provides an option to make a contents menu for the
current man page (using <code>imenu</code>).  Alternatively, if you customize
the option <code>woman-imenu</code> to <code>t</code> then WoMan will do it
automatically for every man page.  The menu title is set by the option
<code>woman-imenu-title</code>, which is &ldquo;CONTENTS&rdquo; by default.  The menu
shows manual sections and subsections by default, but you can change
this by customizing <code>woman-imenu-generic-expression</code>.

<p>WoMan is configured not to replace spaces in an imenu
<samp><span class="file">*Completion*</span></samp> buffer.  For further documentation on the use of
imenu, such as menu sorting, see the source file <samp><span class="file">imenu.el</span></samp>, which
is distributed with GNU Emacs.

<h2 class="chapter">5 Customization</h2>

<p><a name="index-customization-80"></a>
All WoMan user options are customizable, and it is recommended to
change them only via the standard Emacs customization facilities. 
WoMan defines a top-level customization group called <code>WoMan</code>
under the parent group <code>Help</code>.  It can be accessed either via the
standard Emacs facilities, e.g., via the `<samp><span class="samp">Help-&gt;Customize</span></samp>'
submenu, or via the WoMan major mode menu.

<p>The top-level WoMan group contains only a few general options and three
subgroups.  The hooks are provided only for special purposes that, for
example, require code to be executed, and should be changed only via
<code>Customization</code> or the function <code>add-hook</code>.  Most
customization should be possible via existing user options.

     <dl>
<dt><code>woman-show-log</code><a name="index-woman_002dshow_002dlog-81"></a><dd>A boolean value that defaults to <code>nil</code>.  If non-<code>nil</code> then show the
<samp><span class="file">*WoMan-Log*</span></samp> buffer if appropriate, i.e., if any warning messages
are written to it.  See <a href="#Log">The *WoMan-Log* Buffer</a>.

     <br><dt><code>woman-pre-format-hook</code><a name="index-woman_002dpre_002dformat_002dhook-82"></a><dd>A hook run immediately before formatting a buffer.  It might, for

     <p class="noindent">[for GNU/Linux and Cygwin respectively.]  A trailing separator (<samp><span class="file">/</span></samp>
for UNIX etc.) on directories is optional and the filename matched if a
directory is specified is the first to match the regexp
<code>man.*\.conf</code>.  If the environment variable <code>MANPATH</code> is not
set but a configuration file is found then it is parsed instead (or as
well) to provide a default value for <code>woman-manpath</code>.

     <br><dt><code>woman-manpath</code><a name="index-woman_002dmanpath-86"></a><dd>A list of strings representing <em>directory trees</em> to search for Unix

subdirectories selected by the value of <code>woman-manpath-man-regexp</code>. 
Non-directory and unreadable files are ignored.  This can also contain
conses, with the car indicating a <code>PATH</code> variable component mapped
to the directory tree given in the cdr.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bMANPATH_007d_002c-environment-variable-87"></a>If not set then the environment variable <code>MANPATH</code> is used.  If no

consulting the man configuration file if found.  By default this is
expected to be either <samp><span class="file">/etc/man.config</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="file">/usr/local/lib/man.conf</span></samp>, which is controlled by the user option
<code>woman-man.conf-path</code>.  An empty substring of <code>MANPATH</code>
denotes the default list.  Otherwise, the default value of this variable
is

     <pre class="lisp">          ("/usr/man" "/usr/local/man")

ignored.  (Specific directories in <code>woman-path</code> are also searched.)

     <p>On Microsoft platforms I recommend including drive letters explicitly,

<samp><span class="file">man?</span></samp>.  Its default value is <code>"[Mm][Aa][Nn]"</code>, which is
case-insensitive mainly for the benefit of Microsoft platforms.  Its
purpose is to avoid directories such as <samp><span class="file">cat?</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">.</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="file">..</span></samp>, etc.

string or <code>nil</code>, which represents the current directory when the
path is expanded and cached.  However, the last component (only) of each
directory string is treated as a regexp (Emacs, not shell) and the
string is expanded into a list of matching directories.  Non-directory
and unreadable files are ignored.  The default value on MS-DOS is

     <pre class="lisp">          ("$DJDIR/info" "$DJDIR/man/cat[1-9onlp]")
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">and on other platforms is <code>nil</code>.

     <p>Any environment variables (names of which must have the Unix-style form
<code>$NAME</code>, e.g., <code>$HOME</code>, <code>$EMACSDATA</code>, <code>$EMACS_DIR</code>,
regardless of platform) are evaluated first but each element must
evaluate to a <em>single</em> directory name (regexp, see above).  For
example

     <pre class="lisp">          ("$EMACSDATA")
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">or equivalently

     <pre class="lisp">          ("$EMACS_DIR/etc")
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">Trailing <samp><span class="file">/</span></samp>s are discarded.  (The directory trees in
<code>woman-manpath</code> are also searched.)  On Microsoft platforms I
recommend including drive letters explicitly.

     <br><dt><code>woman-cache-level</code><a name="index-woman_002dcache_002dlevel-92"></a><dd>A positive integer representing the level of topic caching:

          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>cache only the topic and directory lists (uses minimal memory, but not
recommended);
<li>cache also the directories for each topic (faster, without using much
more memory);
<li>cache also the actual filenames for each topic (fastest, but uses twice
as much memory).
          </ol>

     <p>The default value is currently 2, a good general compromise.  If the
<code>woman</code> command is slow to find files then try 3, which may be
particularly beneficial with large remote-mounted man directories.  Run
the <code>woman</code> command with a prefix argument or delete the cache file
<code>woman-cache-filename</code> for a change to take effect.  (Values &lt; 1
behave like 1; values &gt; 3 behave like 3.)

     <br><dt><code>woman-cache-filename</code><a name="index-woman_002dcache_002dfilename-93"></a><dd>Either a string representing the full pathname of the WoMan directory
and topic cache file, or <code>nil</code>.  It is used to save and restore the
cache between Emacs sessions.  This is especially useful with
remote-mounted man page files!  The default value of <code>nil</code>
suppresses this action.  The &ldquo;standard&rdquo; non-<code>nil</code> filename is
<samp><span class="file">~/.wmncach.el</span></samp>.  Remember that a prefix argument forces the
<code>woman</code> command to update and re-write the cache.

     <br><dt><code>woman-dired-keys</code><a name="index-woman_002ddired_002dkeys-94"></a><dd>A list of <code>dired</code> mode keys to be defined to run WoMan on the
current file, e.g., <code>("w" "W")</code> or any non-<code>nil</code> atom to
automatically define <kbd>w</kbd> and <kbd>W</kbd> if they are unbound, or
<code>nil</code> to do nothing.  Default is <code>t</code>.

     <br><dt><code>woman-imenu-generic-expression</code><a name="index-woman_002dimenu_002dgeneric_002dexpression-95"></a><dd>Imenu support for Sections and Subsections: an alist with elements of
the form <code>(MENU-TITLE REGEXP INDEX)</code>&mdash;see the documentation for
<code>imenu-generic-expression</code>.  Default value is

     <pre class="lisp">          ((nil "\n\\([A-Z].*\\)" 1)  ; SECTION, but not TITLE
           ("*Subsections*" "^   \\([A-Z].*\\)" 1))
     </pre>
     <br><dt><code>woman-imenu</code><a name="index-woman_002dimenu-96"></a><dd>A boolean value that defaults to <code>nil</code>.  If non-<code>nil</code> then WoMan adds
a Contents menu to the menubar by calling <code>imenu-add-to-menubar</code>.

     <br><dt><code>woman-imenu-title</code><a name="index-woman_002dimenu_002dtitle-97"></a><dd>A string representing the title to use if WoMan adds a Contents menu to
the menubar.  Default is <code>"CONTENTS"</code>.

     <br><dt><code>woman-use-topic-at-point</code><a name="index-woman_002duse_002dtopic_002dat_002dpoint-98"></a><dd>A boolean value that defaults to <code>nil</code>.  If non-<code>nil</code> then
the <code>woman</code> command uses the word at point as the topic,
<em>without interactive confirmation</em>, if it exists as a topic.

     <br><dt><code>woman-use-topic-at-point-default</code><a name="index-woman_002duse_002dtopic_002dat_002dpoint_002ddefault-99"></a><dd>A boolean value representing the default value for
<code>woman-use-topic-at-point</code>.  The default value is <code>nil</code>. 
[The variable <code>woman-use-topic-at-point</code> may be <code>let</code>-bound
when <code>woman</code> is loaded, in which case its global value does not
get defined.  The function <code>woman-file-name</code> sets it to this
value if it is unbound.]

     <br><dt><code>woman-uncompressed-file-regexp</code><a name="index-woman_002duncompressed_002dfile_002dregexp-100"></a><dd>A regular match expression used to select man source files (ignoring any
compression extension).  The default value is
<code>"\\.\\([0-9lmnt]\\w*\\)"</code> [which means a filename extension is
required].

     <p><em>Do not change this unless you are sure you know what you are doing!</em>

     <p>The SysV standard man pages use two character suffixes, and this is
becoming more common in the GNU world.  For example, the man pages in
the <code>ncurses</code> package include <samp><span class="file">toe.1m</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">form.3x</span></samp>, etc.

     <p><strong>Please note:</strong> an optional compression regexp will be appended,
so this regexp <em>must not</em> end with any kind of string terminator
such as <code>$</code> or <code>\\'</code>.

     <br><dt><code>woman-file-compression-regexp</code><a name="index-woman_002dfile_002dcompression_002dregexp-101"></a><dd>A regular match expression used to match compressed man file extensions
for which decompressors are available and handled by auto-compression
mode.  It should begin with <code>\\.</code> and end with <code>\\'</code> and
<em>must not</em> be optional.  The default value is
<code>"\\.\\(g?z\\|bz2\\|xz\\)\\'"</code>, which matches the <code>gzip</code>,
<code>bzip2</code>, and <code>xz</code> compression extensions.

     <p><em>Do not change this unless you are sure you know what you are doing!</em>

     <p>[It should be compatible with the <code>car</code> of
<code>jka-compr-file-name-handler-entry</code>, but that is unduly
complicated, includes an inappropriate extension (<samp><span class="file">.tgz</span></samp>) and is
not loaded by default!]

     <br><dt><code>woman-use-own-frame</code><a name="index-woman_002duse_002down_002dframe-102"></a><dd>If non-<code>nil</code> then use a dedicated frame for displaying WoMan windows. 
This is useful only when WoMan is run under a window system such as X or
Microsoft Windows that supports real multiple frames, in which case the
default value is non-<code>nil</code>.

<h3 class="section">5.2 Formatting Options</h3>

<p><a name="index-formatting-options-103"></a>
These options control the layout that WoMan uses to format the man page.

     <dl>
<dt><code>woman-fill-column</code><a name="index-woman_002dfill_002dcolumn-104"></a><dd>An integer specifying the right margin for formatted text.  Default is
65.

     <br><dt><code>woman-fill-frame</code><a name="index-woman_002dfill_002dframe-105"></a><dd>A boolean value.  If non-<code>nil</code> then most of the frame width is used,
overriding the value of <code>woman-fill-column</code>.  Default is <code>nil</code>.

     <br><dt><code>woman-default-indent</code><a name="index-woman_002ddefault_002dindent-106"></a><dd>An integer specifying the default prevailing indent for the <code>-man</code>
macros.  Default is 5.  Set this variable to 7 to emulate GNU/Linux man
formatting.

     <br><dt><code>woman-bold-headings</code><a name="index-woman_002dbold_002dheadings-107"></a><dd>A boolean value.  If non-<code>nil</code> then embolden section and subsection
headings.  Default is <code>t</code>.  [Heading emboldening is <em>not</em> standard
<code>man</code> behavior.]

     <br><dt><code>woman-ignore</code><a name="index-woman_002dignore-108"></a><dd>A boolean value.  If non-<code>nil</code> then unrecognized requests etc. are
ignored.  Default is <code>t</code>.  This gives the standard <code>roff</code> behavior. 
If <code>nil</code> then they are left in the buffer, which may aid debugging.

     <br><dt><code>woman-preserve-ascii</code><a name="index-woman_002dpreserve_002dascii-109"></a><dd>A boolean value.  If non-<code>nil</code> then preserve <acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters in the
WoMan buffer.  Otherwise, non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters (that display as
<acronym>ASCII</acronym>) may remain, which is irrelevant unless the buffer is to be
saved to a file.  Default is <code>nil</code>.

     <br><dt><code>woman-emulation</code><a name="index-woman_002demulation-110"></a><dd>WoMan emulation, currently either <code>nroff</code> or <code>troff</code>.  Default
is <code>nroff</code>.  <code>troff</code> emulation is experimental and largely
untested.

<h3 class="section">5.3 Faces</h3>

<p><a name="index-faces-111"></a>
These options control the display faces that WoMan uses to format the
man page.

     <dl>
<dt><code>woman-fontify</code><a name="index-woman_002dfontify-112"></a><dd>A boolean value.  If non-<code>nil</code> then WoMan assumes that face support is
available.  It defaults to a non-<code>nil</code> value if the display supports
either colors or different fonts.

     <br><dt><code>woman-italic-face</code><a name="index-woman_002ditalic_002dface-113"></a><dd>Face for italic font in man pages.  Default: italic, underlined,
foreground red.  This is overkill!  <code>troff</code> uses just italic;
<code>nroff</code> uses just underline.  You should probably select either
italic or underline as you prefer, but not both, although italic and
underline work together perfectly well!

     <br><dt><code>woman-bold-face</code><a name="index-woman_002dbold_002dface-114"></a><dd>Face for bold font in man pages.  Default: bold, foreground blue.

     <br><dt><code>woman-unknown-face</code><a name="index-woman_002dunknown_002dface-115"></a><dd>Face for all unknown fonts in man pages.  Default: foreground brown. 
Brown is a good compromise: it is distinguishable from the default but
not enough so as to make font errors look terrible.  (Files that use
non-standard fonts seem to do so badly or in idiosyncratic ways!)

     <br><dt><code>woman-addition-face</code><a name="index-woman_002daddition_002dface-116"></a><dd>Face for all additions made by WoMan to man pages. 
Default: foreground orange.

<h3 class="section">5.4 Special symbols</h3>

<p><a name="index-special-symbols-117"></a>
This section currently applies <em>only</em> to Microsoft Windows.

<p>WoMan provides partial experimental support for special symbols,
initially only for MS-Windows and only for MS-Windows fonts.  This
includes both non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters from the main text font and use
of a separate symbol font.  Later, support will be added for other font
types (e.g., <code>bdf</code> fonts) and for the X Window System.  In Emacs
20.7, the current support works partially under Windows 9x but may not
work on any other platform.

     <dl>
<dt><code>woman-use-extended-font</code><a name="index-woman_002duse_002dextended_002dfont-118"></a><dd>A boolean value.  If non-<code>nil</code> then WoMan may use non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters
from the default font.  Default is <code>t</code>.

     <br><dt><code>woman-use-symbol-font</code><a name="index-woman_002duse_002dsymbol_002dfont-119"></a><dd>A boolean value.  If non-<code>nil</code> then WoMan may use the symbol font. 
Default is <code>nil</code>, mainly because it may change the line spacing (at
least in NTEmacs 20).

     <br><dt><code>woman-symbol-font</code><a name="index-woman_002dsymbol_002dfont-120"></a><dd>A string describing the symbol font to use for special characters. 
It should be compatible with, and the same size as, the default text font. 
Under MS-Windows, the default is

     <pre class="lisp">          "-*-Symbol-normal-r-*-*-*-*-96-96-p-*-ms-symbol"
     </pre>

<h2 class="chapter">6 The *WoMan-Log* Buffer</h2>

<p><a name="index-log-buffer-121"></a><a name="index-buffer_002c-log-122"></a>
This is modeled on the Emacs byte-compiler.  It logs all files
formatted by WoMan and the time taken.  If WoMan finds anything that it
cannot handle then it writes a warning to this buffer.  If the variable
<code>woman-show-log</code> is non-<code>nil</code> (by default it is <code>nil</code>) then
WoMan automatically displays this buffer.  See <a href="#Interface-Options">Interface Options</a>.  Many WoMan warnings can be completely ignored,
because they are reporting the fact that WoMan has ignored requests that
it is correct for WoMan to ignore.  In some future version this level of
paranoia may be reduced, but not until WoMan is deemed more reliable. 
At present, all warnings should be treated with some suspicion. 
Uninterpreted escape sequences are also logged (in some cases).

<p>By resetting the variable <code>woman-ignore</code> to <code>nil</code> (by default
it is <code>t</code>), uninterpreted <code>roff</code> requests can optionally be
left in the formatted buffer to indicate precisely where they occurred. 
See <a href="#Interface-Options">Interface Options</a>.

<h3 class="heading">Horizontal and vertical spacing and resolution</h3>

<p>WoMan currently assumes 10 characters per inch horizontally, hence a
horizontal resolution of 24 basic units, and 5 lines per inch
vertically, hence a vertical resolution of 48 basic units. 
(<code>nroff</code> uses 240 per inch.)

<h3 class="heading">Vertical spacing and blank lines</h3>

<p>The number of consecutive blank lines in the formatted buffer should be
either 0 or 1.  A blank line should leave a space like .sp 1. 
Current policy is to output vertical space only immediately before text
is output.

If WoMan fails completely, or formats a file incorrectly (i.e.,
obviously wrongly or significantly differently from <code>man</code>) or
inelegantly, then please

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>try the latest version of <samp><span class="file">woman.el</span></samp> from the Emacs repository
on <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/emacs/">http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/emacs/</a>.  If it still fails, please

     <li>use <kbd>M-x report-emacs-bug</kbd> to send a bug report. 
Please include the entry from the
<samp><span class="file">*WoMan-Log*</span></samp> buffer relating to the problem file, together with
a brief description of the problem.  Please indicate where you got the
man source file from, but do not send it unless asked to send it.

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix A GNU Free Documentation License</h2>

<!-- The GNU Free Documentation License. -->
<div align="center">Version 1.3, 3 November 2008</div>

<!-- This file is intended to be included within another document, -->
<!-- hence no sectioning command or @node. -->
<pre class="display">     Copyright &copy; 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <a href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a>
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>
     <ol type=1 start=0>
<li>PREAMBLE

     <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <dfn>free</dfn> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. 
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

     <p>This License is a kind of &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

     <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

     <li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     <p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The &ldquo;Document&rdquo;, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

     <p>A &ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

     <p>A &ldquo;Secondary Section&rdquo; is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

     <p>The &ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

     <p>The &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

     <p>A &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. 
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.

     <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, SGML or XML using a publicly available
DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and
JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

     <p>The &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     <p>The &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.

     <p>A section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;.)  To &ldquo;Preserve the Title&rdquo;
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; according to this definition.

     <p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

     <li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     <li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. 
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

     <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     <li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

          <ol type=A start=1>
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

          <li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

          <li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

          <li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

          <li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

          <li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

          <li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

          <li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

          <li>Preserve the section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

          <li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

          <li>For any section Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

          <li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

          <li>Delete any section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

          <li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo; or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

          <li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          </ol>

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     <p>You may add a section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties&mdash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     <li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

     <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
and any sections Entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.  You must delete all
sections Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements.&rdquo;

     <li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     <li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. 
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

     <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. 
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

     <li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     <p>If a section in the Document is Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

     <li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

     <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

     <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

     <li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

     <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

     <li>RELICENSING

     <p>&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC Site&rdquo;) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC&rdquo;) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.

     <p>&ldquo;CC-BY-SA&rdquo; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

     <p>&ldquo;Incorporate&rdquo; means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.

     <p>An MMC is &ldquo;eligible for relicensing&rdquo; if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

     <p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

     </ol>

<h3 class="heading">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

<pre class="smallexample">       Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.
</pre>
<p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the &ldquo;with<small class="dots">...</small>Texts.&rdquo; line with this:

<pre class="smallexample">         with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being <var>list</var>.
</pre>
<p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

<p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
