<h2 class="unnumbered">Forms Mode</h2>

<p>Forms mode is an Emacs major mode for working with simple textual data
bases in a forms-oriented manner.  In Forms mode, the information in
these files is presented in an Emacs window in a user-defined format,
one record at a time.  The user can view records or modify their
contents.

   <p>Forms mode is not a simple major mode, but requires two files to do its
job: a control file and a data file.  The data file holds the
actual data to be presented.  The control file describes
how to present it.

   <p>This file documents Forms mode, a form-editing major mode for GNU Emacs.

<h2 class="chapter">1 Forms Example</h2>

<p>Let's illustrate Forms mode with an example.  Suppose you are looking at
the <samp><span class="file">/etc/passwd</span></samp> file, and the screen looks like this:

<pre class="example">     ====== /etc/passwd ======
     
     User : root   Uid: 0   Gid: 1
     
     Name : Super User
     
     Home : /
     
     Shell: /bin/sh
</pre>
   <p>As you can see, the familiar fields from the entry for the super user
are all there, but instead of being colon-separated on one single line,
they make up a forms.

   <p>The contents of the forms consist of the contents of the fields of the
record (e.g., `<samp><span class="samp">root</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">Super User</span></samp>')
interspersed with normal text (e.g., `<samp><span class="samp">User : </span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">Uid: </span></samp>').

   <p>If you modify the contents of the fields, Forms mode will analyze your
changes and update the file appropriately.  You cannot modify the
interspersed explanatory text (unless you go to some trouble about it),
because that is marked read-only (see <a href="elisp.html#Text-Properties">Text Properties</a>).

   <p>The Forms mode control file specifies the relationship between the
format of <samp><span class="file">/etc/passwd</span></samp> and what appears on the screen in Forms
mode.  See <a href="#Control-File-Format">Control File Format</a>.

<h2 class="chapter">2 Entering and Exiting Forms Mode</h2>

     
<a name="index-forms_002dfind_002dfile-1"></a>
<dl><dt><kbd>M-x forms-find-file &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>control-file</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Visit a database using Forms mode.  Specify the name of the
<strong>control file</strong>, not the data file!

     <p><a name="index-forms_002dfind_002dfile_002dother_002dwindow-2"></a><br><dt><kbd>M-x forms-find-file-other-window &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>control-file</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Similar, but displays the file in another window. 
</dl>

   <p>The command <code>forms-find-file</code> evaluates the file
<var>control-file</var>, and also visits it in Forms mode.  What you see in
its buffer is not the contents of this file, but rather a single record
of the corresponding data file that is visited in its own buffer.  So
there are two buffers involved in Forms mode: the <dfn>forms buffer</dfn>
that is initially used to visit the control file and that shows the
records being browsed, and the <dfn>data buffer</dfn> that holds the data
file being visited.  The latter buffer is normally not visible.

   <p>Initially, the first record is displayed in the forms buffer. 
The mode line displays the major mode name `<samp><span class="samp">Forms</span></samp>', followed by the
minor mode `<samp><span class="samp">View</span></samp>' if the data base is read-only.  The number of the
current record (<var>n</var>) and the total number of records in the
file(<var>t</var>) are shown in the mode line as `<samp><var>n</var><span class="samp">/</span><var>t</var></samp>'.  For
example:

<pre class="example">     --%%-Emacs: passwd-demo          (Forms View 1/54)----All-------
</pre>
   <p>If the buffer is not read-only, you may change the buffer to modify the
fields in the record.  When you move to a different record, the contents
of the buffer are parsed using the specifications in
<code>forms-format-list</code>, and the data file is updated.  If the record
has fields that aren't included in the display, they are not changed.

   <p><a name="index-forms_002dmode_002dhook-3"></a>Entering Forms mode runs the normal hook <code>forms-mode-hook</code> to
perform user-defined customization.

   <p>To save any modified data, you can use <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd>
(<code>forms-save-buffer</code>).  This does not save the forms buffer (which would
be rather useless), but instead saves the buffer visiting the data file.

   <p>To terminate Forms mode, you can use <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd> (<code>forms-save-buffer</code>)
and then kill the forms buffer.  However, the data buffer will still
remain.  If this is not desired, you have to kill this buffer too.

<h2 class="chapter">3 Forms Commands</h2>

<p>The commands of Forms mode belong to the <kbd>C-c</kbd> prefix, with one
exception: &lt;TAB&gt;, which moves to the next field.  Forms mode uses
different key maps for normal mode and read-only mode.  In read-only
Forms mode, you can access most of the commands without the <kbd>C-c</kbd>
prefix, but you must type ordinary letters instead of control
characters; for example, type <kbd>n</kbd> instead of <kbd>C-c C-n</kbd>.

   <p>If your Emacs has been built with X-toolkit support, Forms mode will
provide its own menu with a number of Forms mode commands.

     
<a name="index-forms_002dnext_002drecord-4"></a>
<a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dn-5"></a>

recalculates the number of records in the data file.

     <p><a name="index-forms_002dnext_002dfield-14"></a><a name="index-TAB-15"></a><br><dt><kbd>&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dc-TAB-16"></a><dt><kbd>C-c &lt;TAB&gt;</kbd><dd>Jump to the next field in the current record (<code>forms-next-field</code>). 
With a numeric argument <var>n</var>, jump forward <var>n</var> fields.  If this command
would move past the last field, it wraps around to the first field.

Forms mode, you cannot edit the fields; most Forms mode commands can be
accessed without the prefix <kbd>C-c</kbd> if you use the normal letter
instead (for example, type <kbd>n</kbd> instead of <kbd>C-c C-n</kbd>).  In edit
mode, you can edit the fields and thus change the contents of the data
base; you must begin Forms mode commands with <code>C-c</code>.  Switching
to edit mode is allowed only if you have write access to the data file.

     <p><a name="index-forms_002dinsert_002drecord-19"></a><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002do-20"></a><br><dt><kbd>C-c C-o</kbd><dd>Create a new record and insert it before the current record
(<code>forms-insert-record</code>).  It starts out with empty (or default)

<h2 class="chapter">4 Data File Format</h2>

<p><a name="index-record-37"></a><a name="index-field-38"></a><a name="index-forms_002dfield_002dsep-39"></a>Files for use with Forms mode are very simple&mdash;each <dfn>record</dfn>
(usually one line) forms the contents of one form.  Each record consists
of a number of <dfn>fields</dfn>, which are separated by the value of the
string <code>forms-field-sep</code>, which is <code>"\t"</code> (a Tab) by default.

   <p><a name="index-forms_002dread_002dfile_002dfilter-40"></a><a name="index-forms_002dwrite_002dfile_002dfilter-41"></a>If the format of the data file is not suitable enough you can define the
filter functions <code>forms-read-file-filter</code> and
<code>forms-write-file-filter</code>. <code>forms-read-file-filter</code> is called
when the data file is read from disk into the data buffer. It operates
on the data buffer, ignoring read-only protections. When the data file
is saved to disk <code>forms-write-file-filter</code> is called to cancel the
effects of <code>forms-read-file-filter</code>. After being saved,
<code>forms-read-file-filter</code> is called again to prepare the data buffer
for further processing.

   <p><a name="index-pseudo_002dnewline-42"></a><a name="index-forms_002dmulti_002dline-43"></a>Fields may contain text which shows up in the forms in multiple lines. 
These lines are separated in the field using a &ldquo;pseudo-newline&rdquo;
character which is defined by the value of the string
<code>forms-multi-line</code>.  Its default value is <code>"\^k"</code> (a Control-K
character).  If it is
set to <code>nil</code>, multiple line fields are prohibited.

   <p>If the data file does not exist, it is automatically created.

<h2 class="chapter">5 Control File Format</h2>

<p><a name="index-control-file-44"></a>The Forms mode <dfn>control file</dfn> serves two purposes.  First, it names
the data file to use, and defines its format and properties.  Second,
the Emacs buffer it occupies is used by Forms mode to display the forms.

   <p>The contents of the control file are evaluated as a Lisp program.  It
should set the following Lisp variables to suitable values:

     
<a name="index-forms_002dfile-45"></a>
<dl><dt><code>forms-file</code><dd>This variable specifies the name of the data file.  Example:

     <pre class="example">          (setq forms-file "my/data-file")
     </pre>
     <p>If the control file doesn't set <code>forms-file</code>, Forms mode
reports an error.

     <p><a name="index-forms_002dformat_002dlist-46"></a><br><dt><code>forms-format-list</code><dd>This variable describes the way the fields of the record are formatted on
the screen.  For details, see <a href="#Format-Description">Format Description</a>.

     <p><a name="index-forms_002dnumber_002dof_002dfields-47"></a><br><dt><code>forms-number-of-fields</code><dd>This variable holds the number of fields in each record of the data
file.  Example:

     <pre class="example">          (setq forms-number-of-fields 10)
     </pre>
     </dl>

   <p>If the control file does not set <code>forms-format-list</code> a default
format is used.  In this situation, Forms mode will deduce the number of
fields from the data file providing this file exists and
<code>forms-number-of-records</code> has not been set in the control file.

   <p>The control file can optionally set the following additional Forms mode
variables.  Most of them have default values that are good for most
applications.

     
<a name="index-forms_002dfield_002dsep-48"></a>
<dl><dt><code>forms-field-sep</code><dd>This variable may be used to designate the string which separates the
fields in the records of the data file.  If not set, it defaults to the
string <code>"\t"</code> (a Tab character).  Example:

     <pre class="example">          (setq forms-field-sep "\t")
     </pre>
     <p><a name="index-forms_002dread_002donly-49"></a><br><dt><code>forms-read-only</code><dd>If the value is non-<code>nil</code>, the data file is treated read-only.  (Forms
mode also treats the data file as read-only if you don't have access to
write it.)  Example:

     <pre class="example">          (set forms-read-only t)
     </pre>
     <p><a name="index-forms_002dmulti_002dline-50"></a><br><dt><code>forms-multi-line</code><dd>This variable specifies the <dfn>pseudo newline</dfn> separator that allows
multi-line fields.  This separator goes between the &ldquo;lines&rdquo; within a
field&mdash;thus, the field doesn't really contain multiple lines, but it
appears that way when displayed in Forms mode.  If the value is
<code>nil</code>, multi-line text fields are prohibited.  The pseudo newline
must not be a character contained in <code>forms-field-sep</code>.

     <p>The default value is <code>"\^k"</code>, the character Control-K.  Example:

     <pre class="example">          (setq forms-multi-line "\^k")
     </pre>
     <p><a name="index-forms_002dread_002dfile_002dfilter-51"></a><br><dt><code>forms-read-file-filter</code><dd>This variable holds the name of a function to be called after the data
file has been read in. This can be used to transform the contents of the
data file into a format more suitable for forms processing. 
If it is <code>nil</code>, no function is called.  For example, to maintain a
gzipped database:

     <pre class="example">          (defun gzip-read-file-filter ()
            (shell-command-on-region (point-min) (point-max)
                                     "gzip -d" t t))

<h2 class="chapter">6 The Format Description</h2>

<p><a name="index-forms_002dformat_002dlist-57"></a>  The variable <code>forms-format-list</code> specifies the format of the data
in the data file, and how to convert the data for display in Forms mode. 
Its value must be a list of Forms mode <dfn>formatting elements</dfn>, each
of which can be a string, a number, a Lisp list, or a Lisp symbol that
evaluates to one of those.  The formatting elements are processed in the
order they appear in the list.

     <dl>
<dt><var>string</var><dd>A string formatting element is inserted in the forms &ldquo;as is,&rdquo; as text
that the user cannot alter.

     <br><dt><var>number</var><dd>A number element selects a field of the record.  The contents of this
field are inserted in the display at this point.  Field numbers count
starting from 1 (one).

     <br><dt><var>list</var><dd>A formatting element that is a list specifies a function call.  This
function is called every time a record is displayed, and its result,
which must be a string, is inserted in the display text.  The function
should do nothing but returning a string.

     <p><a name="index-forms_002dfields-58"></a>The function you call can access the fields of the record as a list in
the variable
<code>forms-fields</code>.

     <br><dt><var>symbol</var><dd>A symbol used as a formatting element should evaluate to a string, number,
or list; the value is interpreted as a formatting element, as described
above. 
</dl>

   <p>If a record does not contain the number of fields as specified in
<code>forms-number-of-fields</code>, a warning message will be printed.  Excess
fields are ignored, missing fields are set to empty.

   <p>The control file which displays <samp><span class="file">/etc/passwd</span></samp> file as demonstrated
in the beginning of this manual might look as follows:

<pre class="example">     ;; <span class="roman">This demo visits <samp>/etc/passwd</samp>.</span>
     
     (setq forms-file "/etc/passwd")
     (setq forms-number-of-fields 7)
     (setq forms-read-only t)                 ; <span class="roman">to make sure</span>
     (setq forms-field-sep ":")
     ;; <span class="roman">Don't allow multi-line fields.</span>
     (setq forms-multi-line nil)
     
     (setq forms-format-list
           (list
            "====== /etc/passwd ======\n\n"
            "User : "    1
            "   Uid: "   3
            "   Gid: "   4
            "\n\n"
            "Name : "    5
            "\n\n"
            "Home : "    6
            "\n\n"
            "Shell: "    7
            "\n"))
</pre>
   <p>When you construct the value of  <code>forms-format-list</code>, you should
usually either quote the whole value, like this,

<pre class="example">     (setq forms-format-list
          '(
            "====== " forms-file " ======\n\n"
            "User : "    1
            (make-string 20 ?-)
            ...
           ))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">or quote the elements which are lists, like this:

<pre class="example">     (setq forms-format-list
           (list
            "====== " forms-file " ======\n\n"
            "User : "    1
            '(make-string 20 ?-)
            ...
           ))
</pre>
   <p>Forms mode validates the contents of <code>forms-format-list</code> when you
visit a database.  If there are errors, processing is aborted with an
error message which includes a descriptive text.  See <a href="#Error-Messages">Error Messages</a>,
for a detailed list of error messages.

   <p>If no <code>forms-format-list</code> is specified, Forms mode will supply a
default format list.  This list contains the name of the file being
visited, and a simple label for each field indicating the field number.

<h2 class="chapter">7 Modifying The Forms Contents</h2>

<p>If <code>forms-read-only</code> is <code>nil</code>, the user can modify the fields
and records of the database.

   <p>All normal editing commands are available for editing the contents of the
displayed record.  You cannot delete or modify the fixed, explanatory
text that comes from string formatting elements, but you can modify the
actual field contents.

   <p>If the variable <code>forms-modified-record-filter</code> is non-<code>nil</code>,
it is called as a function before the new data is written to the data
file.  The function receives one argument, a vector that contains the
contents of the fields of the record.

   <p>The function can refer to fields with <code>aref</code> and modify them with
<code>aset</code>.  The first field has number 1 (one); thus, element 0 of the
vector is not used.  The function should return the same vector it was
passed; the (possibly modified) contents of the vector determine what is
actually written in the file.  Here is an example:

<pre class="example">     (defun my-modified-record-filter (record)
       ;; <span class="roman">Modify second field.</span>
       (aset record 2 (current-time-string))
       ;; <span class="roman">Return the field vector.</span>
       record)
     
     (setq forms-modified-record-filter 'my-modified-record-filter)
</pre>
   <p>If the variable <code>forms-new-record-filter</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, its
value is a function to be called to fill in default values for the
fields of a new record.  The function is passed a vector of empty
strings, one for each field; it should return the same vector, with
the desired field values stored in it.  Fields are numbered starting
from 1 (one).  Example:

<pre class="example">     (defun my-new-record-filter (fields)
       (aset fields 5 (login-name))
       (aset fields 1 (current-time-string))
       fields)
     
     (setq forms-new-record-filter 'my-new-record-filter)

<h2 class="chapter">8 Miscellaneous</h2>

<p><a name="index-forms_002dversion-59"></a>The global variable <code>forms-version</code> holds the version information
of the Forms mode software.

   <p><a name="index-forms_002denumerate-60"></a>It is very convenient to use symbolic names for the fields in a record. 
The function <code>forms-enumerate</code> provides an elegant means to define
a series of variables whose values are consecutive integers.  The
function returns the highest number used, so it can be used to set
<code>forms-number-of-fields</code> also.  For example:

<pre class="example">     (setq forms-number-of-fields
           (forms-enumerate
            '(field1 field2 field3 ...)))
</pre>
   <p>This sets <code>field1</code> to 1, <code>field2</code> to 2, and so on.

   <p>Care has been taken to keep the Forms mode variables buffer-local, so it
is possible to visit multiple files in Forms mode simultaneously, even
if they have different properties.

   <p><a name="index-forms_002dmode-61"></a>If you have visited the control file in normal fashion with
<code>find-file</code> or a like command, you can switch to Forms mode with
the command <code>M-x forms-mode</code>.  If you put `<samp><span class="samp">-*- forms -*-</span></samp>' in
the first line of the control file, then visiting it enables Forms mode
automatically.  But this makes it hard to edit the control file itself,
so you'd better think twice before using this.

   <p>The default format for the data file, using <code>"\t"</code> to separate
fields and <code>"\^k"</code> to separate lines within a field, matches the
file format of some popular database programs, e.g., FileMaker.  So
<code>forms-mode</code> can decrease the need to use proprietary software.

<h2 class="chapter">9 Error Messages</h2>

<p>This section describes all error messages which can be generated by
forms mode.  Error messages that result from parsing the control file
all start with the text `<samp><span class="samp">Forms control file error</span></samp>'.  Messages
generated while analyzing the definition of <code>forms-format-list</code>
start with `<samp><span class="samp">Forms format error</span></samp>'.

work under the conditions stated herein.  The &ldquo;Document&rdquo;, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

     <p>A &ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

     <p>A &ldquo;Secondary Section&rdquo; is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

     <p>The &ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

     <p>The &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

     <p>A &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. 
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.

     <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, SGML or XML using a publicly available
DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and
JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

     <p>The &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     <p>The &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.

     <p>A section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;.)  To &ldquo;Preserve the Title&rdquo;
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; according to this definition.

     <p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

     <li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     <li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. 
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

     <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     <li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

          <ol type=A start=1>
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

          <li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

          <li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

          <li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

          <li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

          <li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

          <li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

          <li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

          <li>Preserve the section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

          <li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

          <li>For any section Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

          <li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

          <li>Delete any section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

          <li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo; or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

          <li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          </ol>

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     <p>You may add a section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties&mdash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     <li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

     <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
and any sections Entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.  You must delete all
sections Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements.&rdquo;

     <li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     <li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. 
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

     <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. 
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

     <li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     <p>If a section in the Document is Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

     <li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

     <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

     <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

     <li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

     <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

     <li>RELICENSING

     <p>&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC Site&rdquo;) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC&rdquo;) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.

     <p>&ldquo;CC-BY-SA&rdquo; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

     <p>&ldquo;Incorporate&rdquo; means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.

     <p>An MMC is &ldquo;eligible for relicensing&rdquo; if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

     <p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

        </ol>

<h3 class="heading">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

<pre class="smallexample">       Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the &ldquo;with<small class="dots">...</small>Texts.&rdquo; line with this:

<pre class="smallexample">         with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being <var>list</var>.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   <p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
