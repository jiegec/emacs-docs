<h2 class="chapter">1 Overview</h2>

<p><a name="index-Overview-of-Flymake-1"></a>
Flymake is a universal on-the-fly syntax checker implemented as an
Emacs minor mode.  Flymake runs the pre-configured syntax check tool
(compiler for C++ files, <code>perl</code> for perl files, etc.) in the
background, passing it a temporary copy of the current buffer, and
parses the output for known error/warning message patterns.  Flymake
then highlights erroneous lines (i.e., lines for which at least one
error or warning has been reported by the syntax check tool), and
displays an overall buffer status in the mode line.  Status information
displayed by Flymake contains total number of errors and warnings
reported for the buffer during the last syntax check.

   </p>
<p><code>flymake-goto-next-error</code> and <code>flymake-goto-prev-error</code>
functions allow for easy navigation to the next/previous erroneous
line, respectively.

   </p>
<p>Calling <code>flymake-display-err-menu-for-current-line</code> will popup a
menu containing error messages reported by the syntax check tool for
the current line.  Errors/warnings belonging to another file, such as a
<code>.h</code> header file included by a <code>.c</code> file, are shown in the
current buffer as belonging to the first line.  Menu items for such
messages also contain a filename and a line number.  Selecting such a
menu item will automatically open the file and jump to the line with
error.

   </p>
<p>Syntax check is done “on-the-fly”.  It is started whenever

     </p>
<ul>
<li>buffer is loaded
</li>
<li>a newline character is added to the buffer
</li>
<li>some changes were made to the buffer more than <code>0.5</code> seconds ago (the
delay is configurable). 
</li>
</ul>

   <p>Flymake is a universal syntax checker in the sense that it's easily
extended to support new syntax check tools and error message
patterns.  See <a href="#Configuring-Flymake">Configuring Flymake</a>.

<div class="node"><a name="Installing-Flymake"></a></div>

<h2 class="chapter">2 Installing</h2>

<p><a name="index-Installing-Flymake-2"></a>

   </p>
<p>Flymake is packaged in a single file, <code>flymake.el</code>.

   </p>
<p>To install/update Flymake, place <code>flymake.el</code> to a directory
somewhere on Emacs load path.  You might also want to byte-compile
<code>flymake.el</code> to improve performance.

   </p>
<p>Also, place the following line in the <code>.emacs</code> file.

</p>
<pre class="lisp">     (require 'flymake)
</pre>
   <p>You might also map the most frequently used Flymake functions, such as
<code>flymake-goto-next-error</code>, to some keyboard shortcuts:

</p>
<pre class="lisp">     (global-set-key [f3] 'flymake-display-err-menu-for-current-line)
     (global-set-key [f4] 'flymake-goto-next-error)

<h3 class="section">3.1 Flymake mode</h3>

<p><a name="index-flymake_002dmode-4"></a>
Flymake is an Emacs minor mode.  To use Flymake, you
must first activate <code>flymake-mode</code> by using the
<code>flymake-mode</code> function.

   </p>
<p>Instead of manually activating <code>flymake-mode</code>, you can configure
Flymake to automatically enable <code>flymake-mode</code> upon opening any
file for which syntax check is possible.  To do so, place the following
line in <code>.emacs</code>:

</p>
<pre class="lisp">     (add-hook 'find-file-hook 'flymake-find-file-hook)
</pre>
   <div class="node"><a name="Running-the-syntax-check"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">3.2 Running the syntax check</h3>

<p><a name="index-Manually-starting-the-syntax-check-5"></a>
When <code>flymake-mode</code> is active, syntax check is started
automatically on any of the three conditions mentioned above.  Syntax
check can also be started manually by using the
<code>flymake-start-syntax-check-for-current-buffer</code> function.  This
can be used, for example, when changes were made to some other buffer
affecting the current buffer.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Navigating-to-error-lines"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">3.3 Navigating to error lines</h3>

<p><a name="index-Navigating-to-error-lines-6"></a>
After syntax check is completed, lines for which at least one error or
warning has been reported are highlighted, and total number of errors
and warning is shown in the mode line.  Use the following functions to
navigate the highlighted lines.

   </p>
<p></p>
<table summary="">
<tr align="left">
<td valign="top" width="25%">
<code>flymake-goto-next-error</code>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">Moves point to the next erroneous line, if any.

<p><br></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr align="left">
<td valign="top" width="25%">
<code>flymake-goto-prev-error</code>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">Moves point to the previous erroneous line.

   <br>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

   <p>These functions treat erroneous lines as a linked list.  Therefore,
<code>flymake-goto-next-error</code> will go to the first erroneous line
when invoked in the end of the buffer.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Viewing-error-messages"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">3.4 Viewing error messages</h3>

<p><a name="index-Viewing-error-messages-7"></a>
To view error messages belonging to the current line, use the
<code>flymake-display-err-menu-for-current-line</code> function.  If there's
at least one error or warning reported for the current line, this
function will display a popup menu with error/warning texts. 
Selecting the menu item whose error belongs to another file brings
forward that file with the help of the
<code>flymake-goto-file-and-line</code> function.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Syntax-check-statuses"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">3.5 Syntax check statuses</h3>

<p><a name="index-Syntax-check-statuses-8"></a>
After syntax check is finished, its status is displayed in the mode line. 
The following statuses are defined.

   </p>
<p></p>
<table summary="">
<tr align="left">
<td valign="top" width="25%">Flymake* or Flymake:E/W*
</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">Flymake is currently running.  For the second case, E/W contains the
error and warning count for the previous run.

<p><br></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr align="left">
<td valign="top" width="25%">Flymake
</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">Syntax check is not running.  Usually this means syntax check was
successfully passed (no errors, no warnings).  Other possibilities are:
syntax check was killed as a result of executing
<code>flymake-compile</code>, or syntax check cannot start as compilation
is currently in progress.

<p><br></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr align="left">
<td valign="top" width="25%">Flymake:E/W
</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">Number of errors/warnings found by the syntax check process.

<p><br></p>
</td>

<tr align="left">
<td valign="top" width="25%">Flymake:! 
</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">Flymake was unable to find master file for the current buffer.
   <br>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

   <p>The following errors cause a warning message and switch flymake mode
OFF for the buffer.

   </p>
<p></p>
<table summary="">
<tr align="left">
<td valign="top" width="25%">CFGERR
</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">Syntax check process returned nonzero exit code, but no
errors/warnings were reported.  This indicates a possible configuration
error (for example, no suitable error message patterns for the
syntax check tool).

<p><br></p>

</tr>
<tr align="left">
<td valign="top" width="25%">NOMASTER
</td>
<td valign="top" width="75%">Flymake was unable to find master file for the current buffer.

<tr align="left">
<td valign="top" width="25%">NOMK

<td valign="top" width="75%">Flymake was unable to find a suitable buildfile for the current buffer.

<p><br></p>

<tr align="left">
<td valign="top" width="25%">PROCERR

</table>

<div class="node"><a name="Troubleshooting"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">3.6 Troubleshooting</h3>

<p><a name="index-Logging-9"></a><a name="index-Troubleshooting-10"></a>
Flymake uses a simple logging facility for indicating important points
in the control flow.  The logging facility sends logging messages to
the <samp><span class="file">*Messages*</span></samp> buffer.  The information logged can be used for
resolving various problems related to Flymake.

   </p>
<p>Logging output is controlled by the <code>flymake-log-level</code>
variable.  <code>3</code> is the  most verbose level, and <code>-1</code> switches
logging off.

</li>
</ul>

   <p>Syntax check tools are configured using the
<code>flymake-allowed-file-name-masks</code> list.  Each item of this list
has the following format:

</p>
<pre class="lisp">     (filename-regexp, init-function, cleanup-function, getfname-function)
</pre>
     <dl>
<dt><code>filename-regexp</code></dt>
<dd>This field is used as a key for locating init/cleanup/getfname
functions for the buffer.  Items in
<code>flymake-allowed-file-name-masks</code> are searched sequentially.  The
first item with <code>filename-regexp</code> matching buffer filename is
selected.  If no match is found, <code>flymake-mode</code> is switched off.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>init-function</code></dt>
<dd>
<code>init-function</code> is required to initialize the syntax check,
usually by creating a temporary copy of the buffer contents.  The
function must return <code>(list cmd-name arg-list)</code>.  If
<code>init-function</code> returns null, syntax check is aborted, by
<code>flymake-mode</code> is not switched off.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>cleanup-function</code></dt>
<dd>
<code>cleanup-function</code> is called after the syntax check process is
complete and should take care of proper deinitialization, which is
usually deleting a temporary copy created by the <code>init-function</code>.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>getfname-function</code></dt>
<dd>This function is used for translating filenames reported by the syntax
check tool into “real” filenames.  Filenames reported by the tool
will be different from the real ones, as actually the tool works with
the temporary copy.  In most cases, the default implementation
provided by Flymake, <code>flymake-get-real-file-name</code>, can be used as
<code>getfname-function</code>.

   </dd>
</dl>

   <p>To add support for a new syntax check tool, write corresponding
<code>init-function</code>, and, optionally <code>cleanup-function</code> and
<code>getfname-function</code>.  If the format of error messages reported by
the new tool is not yet supported by Flymake, add a new entry to
the <code>flymake-err-line-patterns</code> list.

   </p>
<p>The following sections contain some examples of configuring Flymake
support for various syntax check tools.

</p>
<div class="node">
<a name="Example---Configuring-a-tool-called-directly"></a><a name="Example_002d_002d_002dConfiguring-a-tool-called-directly"></a>
</div>

<h4 class="subsection">4.2.1 Example—Configuring a tool called directly</h4>

<p><a name="index-Adding-support-for-perl-14"></a>
In this example, we will add support for <code>perl</code> as a syntax check
tool.  <code>perl</code> supports the <code>-c</code> option which does syntax
checking.

   </p>
<p>First, we write the <code>init-function</code>:

</p>
<pre class="lisp">     (defun flymake-perl-init ()
       (let* ((temp-file (flymake-init-create-temp-buffer-copy
                          'flymake-create-temp-inplace))
              (local-file (file-relative-name
                           temp-file
                           (file-name-directory buffer-file-name))))
         (list "perl" (list "-wc " local-file))))
</pre>
   <p><code>flymake-perl-init</code> creates a temporary copy of the buffer
contents with the help of
<code>flymake-init-create-temp-buffer-copy</code>, and builds an appropriate
command line.

   </p>
<p>Next, we add a new entry to the
<code>flymake-allowed-file-name-masks</code>:

</p>
<pre class="lisp">     (setq flymake-allowed-file-name-masks
           (cons '(".+\\.pl$"
                   flymake-perl-init
                   flymake-simple-cleanup
                   flymake-get-real-file-name)
                 flymake-allowed-file-name-masks))
</pre>
   <p>Note that we use standard <code>cleanup-function</code> and

<p>Finally, we add an entry to <code>flymake-err-line-patterns</code>:

<p><a name="index-Adding-support-for-C-_0028gcc_002bmake_0029-15"></a>
In this example we will add support for C files syntax checked by
<samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp> called via <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp>.

   </p>
<p>We're not required to write any new functions, as Flymake already has
functions for <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp>.  We just add a new entry to the
<code>flymake-allowed-file-name-masks</code>:

</p>
<pre class="lisp">     (setq flymake-allowed-file-name-masks
           (cons '(".+\\.c$"
                   flymake-simple-make-init
                   flymake-simple-cleanup
                   flymake-get-real-file-name)
                 flymake-allowed-file-name-masks))
</pre>
   <p><code>flymake-simple-make-init</code> builds the following <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp>
command line:

</p>
<pre class="lisp">     (list "make"
           (list "-s" "-C"
                 base-dir
                 (concat "CHK_SOURCES=" source)
                 "SYNTAX_CHECK_MODE=1"
                 "check-syntax"))
</pre>
   <p><code>base-dir</code> is a directory containing <code>Makefile</code>, see <a href="#Locating-the-buildfile">Locating the buildfile</a>.

   </p>
<p>Thus, <code>Makefile</code> must contain the <code>check-syntax</code> target.  In
our case this target might look like this:

</p>
<pre class="verbatim">
check-syntax:
	gcc -o /dev/null -S ${CHK_SOURCES}
</pre>

<p class="noindent">The format of error messages reported by <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp> is already
supported by Flymake, so we don't have to add a new entry to
<code>flymake-err-line-patterns</code>.  Note that if you are using
Automake, you may want to replace <code>gcc</code> with the standard
Automake variable <code>COMPILE</code>:

</p>
<pre class="verbatim">
check-syntax:
	$(COMPILE) -o /dev/null -S ${CHK_SOURCES}

   <p>Syntax check is started by calling <code>flymake-start-syntax-check-for-current-buffer</code>. 
Flymake first determines whether it is able to do syntax
check.  It then saves a copy of the buffer in a temporary file in the
buffer's directory (or in the system temp directory, for java
files), creates a syntax check command and launches a process with
this command.  The output is parsed using a list of error message patterns,
and error information (file name, line number, type and text) is
saved.  After the process has finished, Flymake highlights erroneous
lines in the buffer using the accumulated error information.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Determining-whether-syntax-check-is-possible"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">5.1 Determining whether syntax check is possible</h3>

<p><a name="index-Syntax-check-models-17"></a><a name="index-Master-file-18"></a>
Syntax check is considered possible if there's an entry in
<code>flymake-allowed-file-name-masks</code> matching buffer's filename and
its <code>init-function</code> returns non-<code>nil</code> value.

   </p>
<p>Two syntax check modes are distinguished:

     </p>
<ol type="1" start="1">

     <li>Buffer can be syntax checked in a standalone fashion, that is, the
file (its temporary copy, in fact) can be passed over to the compiler to
do the syntax check.  Examples are C/C++ (.c, .cpp) and Java (.java)
sources.

     </li>
<li>Buffer can be syntax checked, but additional file, called master file,
is required to perform this operation.  A master file is a file that
includes the current file, so that running a syntax check tool on it
will also check syntax in the current file.  Examples are C/C++ (.h,
.hpp) headers.

        </li>
</ol>

   <p>These modes are handled inside init/cleanup/getfname functions, see
<a href="#Adding-support-for-a-new-syntax-check-tool">Adding support for a new syntax check tool</a>.

   </p>
<p>Flymake contains implementations of all functionality required to
support different syntax check modes described above (making temporary
copies, finding master files, etc.), as well as some tool-specific
(routines for Make, Ant, etc.) code.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Making-a-temporary-copy"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">5.2 Making a temporary copy</h3>

<p><a name="index-Temporary-copy-of-the-buffer-19"></a><a name="index-Master-file-20"></a>
After the possibility of the syntax check has been determined, a
temporary copy of the current buffer is made so that the most recent
unsaved changes could be seen by the syntax check tool.  Making a copy
is quite straightforward in a standalone case (mode <code>1</code>), as it's
just saving buffer contents to a temporary file.

   </p>
<p>Things get trickier, however, when master file is involved, as it
requires to

     </p>
<ul>
<li>locate a master file
</li>
<li>patch it to include the current file using its new (temporary)
name. 
</li>
</ul>

   <p>Locating a master file is discussed in the following section.

   </p>
<p>Patching just changes all appropriate lines of the master file so that they
use the new (temporary) name of the current file.  For example, suppose current
file name is <code>file.h</code>, the master file is <code>file.cpp</code>, and
it includes current file via <code>#include "file.h"</code>.  Current file's copy
is saved to file <code>file_flymake.h</code>, so the include line must be
changed to <code>#include "file_flymake.h"</code>.  Finally, patched master file
is saved to <code>file_flymake_master.cpp</code>, and the last one is passed to
the syntax check tool.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Locating-a-master-file"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">5.3 Locating a master file</h3>

<p><a name="index-Master-file-21"></a>
Master file is located in two steps.

   </p>
<p>First, a list of possible master files is built.  A simple name
matching is used to find the files.  For a C++ header <code>file.h</code>,
Flymake searches for all <code>.cpp</code> files in the directories whose relative paths are
stored in a customizable variable <code>flymake-master-file-dirs</code>, which
usually contains something like <code>("." "./src")</code>.  No more than
<code>flymake-master-file-count-limit</code> entries is added to the master file
list.  The list is then sorted to move files with names <code>file.cpp</code> to
the top.

   </p>
<p>Next, each master file in a list is checked to contain the appropriate
include directives.  No more than <code>flymake-check-file-limit</code> of each
file are parsed.

   </p>
<p>For <code>file.h</code>, the include directives to look for are
<code>#include "file.h"</code>, <code>#include "../file.h"</code>, etc.  Each
include is checked against a list of include directories
(see <a href="#Getting-the-include-directories">Getting the include directories</a>) to be sure it points to the
correct <code>file.h</code>.

   </p>
<p>First matching master file found stops the search.  The master file is then
patched and saved to disk.  In case no master file is found, syntax check is
aborted, and corresponding status (!) is reported in the mode line.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Getting-the-include-directories"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">5.4 Getting the include directories</h3>

<p><a name="index-Include-directories-_0028C_002fC_002b_002b-specific_0029-22"></a>
Two sets of include directories are distinguished: system include directories
and project include directories.  The former is just the contents of the
<code>INCLUDE</code> environment variable.  The latter is not so easy to obtain,
and the way it can be obtained can vary greatly for different projects. 
Therefore, a customizable variable
<code>flymake-get-project-include-dirs-function</code> is used to provide the
way to implement the desired behavior.

   </p>
<p>The default implementation, <code>flymake-get-project-include-dirs-imp</code>,
uses a <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> call.  This requires a correct base directory, that is, a
directory containing a correct <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp>, to be determined.

   </p>
<p>As obtaining the project include directories might be a costly operation, its
return value is cached in the hash table.  The cache is cleared in the beginning
of every syntax check attempt.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Locating-the-buildfile"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">5.5 Locating the buildfile</h3>

<p><a name="index-Locating-the-buildfile-23"></a><a name="index-buildfile_002c-locating-24"></a><a name="index-Makefile_002c-locating-25"></a>
Flymake can be configured to use different tools for performing syntax
checks.  For example, it can use direct compiler call to syntax check a perl
script or a call to <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> for a more complicated case of a
<code>C/C++</code> source.  The general idea is that simple files, like perl
scripts and html pages, can be checked by directly invoking a
corresponding tool.  Files that are usually more complex and generally
used as part of larger projects, might require non-trivial options to
be passed to the syntax check tool, like include directories for
C++.  The latter files are syntax checked using some build tool, like
Make or Ant.

   </p>
<p>All Make configuration data is usually stored in a file called
<code>Makefile</code>.  To allow for future extensions, flymake uses a notion of
buildfile to reference the 'project configuration' file.

   </p>
<p>Special function, <code>flymake-find-buildfile</code> is provided for locating buildfiles. 
Searching for a buildfile is done in a manner similar to that of searching
for possible master files. 
In case there's no build file, syntax check is aborted.

   </p>
<p>Buildfile values are also cached.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Starting-the-syntax-check-process"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">5.6 Starting the syntax check process</h3>

<p><a name="index-Syntax-check-process-26"></a>
The command line (command name and the list of arguments) for launching a process is returned by the
initialization function.  Flymake then just calls <code>start-process</code>
to start an asynchronous process and configures a process filter and
sentinel, which are used for processing the output of the syntax check
tool.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Parsing-the-output"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">5.7 Parsing the output</h3>

<p><a name="index-Parsing-the-output-27"></a>
The output generated by the syntax check tool is parsed in the process
filter/sentinel using the error message patterns stored in the
<code>flymake-err-line-patterns</code> variable.  This variable contains a
list of items of the form <code>(regexp file-idx line-idx
err-text-idx)</code>, used to determine whether a particular line is an
error message and extract file name, line number and error text,
respectively.  Error type (error/warning) is also guessed by matching
error text with the '<code>^[wW]arning</code>' pattern.  Anything that was not
classified as a warning is considered an error.  Type is then used to
sort error menu items, which shows error messages first.

   </p>
<p>Flymake is also able to interpret error message patterns missing err-text-idx
information.  This is done by merely taking the rest of the matched line
(<code>(substring line (match-end 0))</code>) as error text.  This trick allows
making use of a huge collection of error message line patterns from
<code>compile.el</code>.  All these error patterns are appended to
the end of <code>flymake-err-line-patterns</code>.

   </p>
<p>The error information obtained is saved in a buffer local
variable.  The buffer for which the process output belongs is
determined from the process-id<!-- /@w -->-&gt;<!-- /@w -->buffer mapping updated
after every process launch/exit.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Highlighting-erroneous-lines"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">5.8 Highlighting erroneous lines</h3>

<p><a name="index-Erroneous-lines_002c-faces-28"></a>
Highlighting is implemented with overlays and happens in the process
sentinel, after calling the cleanup function.  Two customizable faces
are used: <code>flymake-errline</code> and
<code>flymake-warnline</code>.  Errors belonging outside the current
buffer are considered to belong to line 1 of the current buffer.

<!-- This manual does not use vindex. -->
<!-- @vindex flymake-fringe-indicator-position -->
<!-- @vindex flymake-error-bitmap -->
<!-- @vindex flymake-warning-bitmap -->
</p>
<p>If the option <code>flymake-fringe-indicator-position</code> is non-<code>nil</code>,
errors and warnings are also highlighted in the left or right fringe,
using the bitmaps specified by <code>flymake-error-bitmap</code>
and <code>flymake-warning-bitmap</code>.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Interaction-with-other-modes"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">5.9 Interaction with other modes</h3>

<p><a name="index-Interaction-with-other-modes-29"></a><a name="index-Interaction-with-compile-mode-30"></a>
The only mode flymake currently knows about is <code>compile</code>.

   </p>
<p>Flymake can be configured to not start syntax check if it thinks the
compilation is in progress.  The check is made by the
<code>flymake-compilation-is-running</code>, which tests the
<code>compilation-in-progress</code> variable.  The reason why this might be
useful is saving CPU time in case both syntax check and compilation
are very CPU intensive.  The original reason for adding this feature,
though, was working around a locking problem with MS Visual C++
compiler.

   </p>
<p>Flymake also provides an alternative command for starting compilation,
<code>flymake-compile</code>:

</p>
<pre class="lisp">     (defun flymake-compile ()
       "Kill all flymake syntax checks then start compilation."
       (interactive)
       (flymake-stop-all-syntax-checks)
       (call-interactively 'compile))
</pre>
   <p>It just kills all the active syntax check processes before calling
<code>compile</code>.

     <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <dfn>free</dfn> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. 
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

     </p>
<p>This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

     </p>
<p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

</li>
<li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     <p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The “Document”, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as “you”.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

     </p>
<p>A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

     </p>
<p>A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

     </p>
<p>The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

     </p>
<p>The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

     </p>
<p>A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. 
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

     </p>
<p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, SGML or XML using a publicly available
DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and
JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

     </p>
<p>The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title Page” means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     </p>
<p>The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.

     </p>
<p>A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as “Acknowledgements”,
“Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)  To “Preserve the Title”
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section “Entitled XYZ” according to this definition.

     </p>
<p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

     </p>
</li>
<li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     </p>
<p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     </p>
</li>
<li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     </p>
<p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     </p>
<p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. 
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

     </p>
<p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     </p>
</li>
<li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

          </p>
<ol type="A" start="1">
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

          </li>
<li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

          </li>
<li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

          </li>
<li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

          </li>
<li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

          </li>
<li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

          </li>
<li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

          </li>
<li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

          </li>
<li>Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled “History” in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

          </li>
<li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the “History” section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

          </li>
<li>For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

          </li>
<li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

          </li>
<li>Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

          </li>
<li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled “Endorsements” or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

          </li>
<li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          </li>
</ol>

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     </p>
<p>You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     </p>
<p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     </p>
<p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     </p>
</li>
<li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

     </p>
<p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     </p>
<p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled “History”
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
“History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You must delete all
sections Entitled “Endorsements.”

     </p>
</li>
<li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     </p>
<p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     </p>
</li>
<li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. 
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

     </p>
<p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. 
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

     </p>
</li>
<li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     </p>
<p>If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
“Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

     </p>
</li>
<li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     </p>
<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

     </p>
<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

     </p>
<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

     </p>
</li>
<li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

     </p>
<p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

     </p>
</li>
<li>RELICENSING

     <p>“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.

     </p>
<p>“CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

     </p>
<p>“Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.

     </p>
<p>An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

     </p>
<p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

        </p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="heading">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">       Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the “with<small class="dots">...</small>Texts.” line with this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">         with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being <var>list</var>.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   </p>
<p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
