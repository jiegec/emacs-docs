<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction</h2>

<p><a name="index-Introduction-1"></a>
Welcome to VHDL Mode. This is a GNU Emacs mode for editing files
containing VHDL code.

   </p>
<p>This manual will describe the following:

     </p>
<ul>
<li>How to get started using VHDL Mode.

     </li>
<li>How the indentation engine works.

     </li>
<li>How to customize the indentation engine.

   </li>
</ul>

   <p><a name="index-vhdl_002dversion-2"></a>The major version number was incremented to 3 with the addition of
many new features for editing VHDL code to the new indentation engine,
which was introduced in major version 2. To find the minor revision
number of this release, use <kbd>M-x vhdl-version RET</kbd>.

   </p>
<p>A special word of thanks goes to Rod Whitby, who wrote the
VHDL Mode indentation engine, and to Barry Warsaw, who wrote
the CC Mode indentation engine that formed the basis
thereof. Their manuals were also the basis for this manual.

   </p>
<p>This manual is not very up-to-date. It basically contains the
indentation machine documentation by Rod Whitby with only minor
adaptions. A short documentation of the entire VHDL Mode is available
within the mode itself by typing <kbd>C-c C-h</kbd>. Also, all commands and
customization of most variables are available through the menu, which
makes everything highly self-explaining.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Getting-Connected"></a></div>

<h2 class="chapter">2 Getting Connected</h2>

<p><a name="index-Getting-Connected-3"></a>
To get started, simply visit a <samp><span class="file">.vhd</span></samp> file in Emacs; or type
<kbd>M-x vhdl-mode RET</kbd>.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="New-Indentation-Engine"></a></div>

<h2 class="chapter">3 New Indentation Engine</h2>

<p><a name="index-New-Indentation-Engine-4"></a>
VHDL Mode has a new indentation engine, providing a simplified, yet
flexible and general mechanism for customizing indentation. It breaks
indentation calculation into two steps. First for the line of code being
indented, VHDL Mode analyzes what kind of language construct it's
looking at, then it applies user defined offsets to the current line
based on this analysis.

   </p>
<p>This section will briefly cover how indentation is calculated in
VHDL Mode. It is important to understand the indentation model
being used so that you will know how to customize VHDL Mode for
your personal coding style.

<h3 class="section">3.1 Syntactic Analysis</h3>

<p><a name="index-Syntactic-Analysis-5"></a>
<a name="index-vhdl_002doffsets_002dalist-6"></a><a name="index-offsets_002dalist-_0028vhdl_002d_0029-7"></a><a name="index-relative-buffer-position-8"></a><a name="index-syntactic-symbol-9"></a><a name="index-syntactic-component-10"></a><a name="index-syntactic-component-list-11"></a><a name="index-relative-buffer-position-12"></a>The first thing VHDL Mode does when indenting a line of code, is
to analyze the line, determining the <dfn>syntactic component list</dfn> of
the construct on that line.  A <dfn>syntactic component</dfn> consists of a
pair of information (in lisp parlance, a <em>cons cell</em>), where the
first part is a <dfn>syntactic symbol</dfn>, and the second part is a
<dfn>relative buffer position</dfn>.  Syntactic symbols describe elements of
VHDL code, e.g., <code>statement</code>, <code>comment</code>, <code>block-open</code>,
<code>block-close</code>, etc.  See <a href="#Syntactic-Symbols">Syntactic Symbols</a>, for a complete list
of currently recognized syntactic symbols and their semantics.  Also,
the variable <code>vhdl-offsets-alist</code> contains the list of currently
supported syntactic symbols.

   </p>
<p>Conceptually, a line of VHDL code is always indented relative to the
indentation of some line higher up in the buffer.  This is represented
by the relative buffer position in the syntactic component.

   </p>
<p>It might help to see an example. Suppose we had the following code as
the only thing in a VHDL Mode buffer <a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>:
</p>
<pre class="example">     
       1: inverter : process
       2: begin
       3:   q &lt;= not d;
       4:   wait on d;
       5: end inverter;
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dx-13"></a><a name="index-vhdl_002dshow_002dsyntactic_002dinformation-14"></a><a name="index-show_002dsyntactic_002dinformation-_0028vhdl_002d_0029-15"></a>We can use the command <kbd>C-c C-x</kbd>
(<code>vhdl-show-syntactic-information</code>) to simply report what the
syntactic analysis is for the current line.  Running this command on
line 4 of example 1, we'd see in the echo area:
</p>
<pre class="example">     
     ((statement . 28))
     
</pre>
   <p>This tells us that the line is a statement and it is indented relative
to buffer position 28, which happens to be the `<samp><span class="samp">q</span></samp>' on line 3.  If
you were to move point to line 3 and hit <kbd>C-c C-x</kbd>, you would see:
</p>
<pre class="example">     
     ((statement-block-intro . 20))
     
</pre>
   <p>This indicates that line 3 is the first statement in a block, and is
indented relative to buffer position 20, which is the `<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>' in the
<code>begin</code> keyword on line 2.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-comment-only-line-16"></a>Syntactic component lists can contain more than one component, and
individual syntactic components need not have relative buffer positions. 
The most common example of this is a line that contains a <dfn>comment
only line</dfn>.
</p>
<pre class="example">     
     %%% TBD %%%
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Hitting <kbd>C-c C-x</kbd> on line 3 of the example gives us:
</p>
<pre class="example">     
     ((comment-intro) (block-intro . 46))
     
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">so you can see that the syntactic component list contains two syntactic
components.  Also notice that the first component,
`<samp><span class="samp">(comment-intro)</span></samp>' has no relative buffer position.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Indentation-Calculation"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">3.2 Indentation Calculation</h3>

<p><a name="index-Indentation-Calculation-17"></a>
<a name="index-vhdl_002doffsets_002dalist-18"></a><a name="index-offsets_002dalist-_0028vhdl_002d_0029-19"></a>Indentation for the current line is calculated using the syntactic
component list derived in step 1 above (see <a href="#Syntactic-Analysis">Syntactic Analysis</a>).  Each component contributes to the final total indentation
of the line in two ways.

   </p>
<p>First, the syntactic symbols are looked up in the <code>vhdl-offsets-alist</code>
variable, which is an association list of syntactic symbols and the
offsets to apply for those symbols.  These offsets are added to the
running total.

   </p>
<p>Second, if the component has a relative buffer position, VHDL Mode
adds the column number of that position to the running total.  By adding
up the offsets and columns for every syntactic component on the list,
the final total indentation for the current line is computed.

   </p>
<p>Let's use our code example above to see how this works.  Here is our
example again.
</p>
<pre class="example">     
       1: inverter : process
       2: begin
       3:   q &lt;= not d;
       4:   wait on d;
       5: end inverter;
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-TAB-20"></a>Let's say point is on line 3 and we hit the &lt;TAB&gt; key to re-indent
the line.  Remember that the syntactic component list for that
line is:
</p>
<pre class="example">     
     ((statement-block-intro . 20))
     
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">VHDL Mode looks up <code>statement-block-intro</code> in the
<code>vhdl-offsets-alist</code> variable.  Let's say it finds the value `<samp><span class="samp">2</span></samp>';
it adds this to the running total (initialized to zero), yielding a
running total indentation of 2 spaces.

   </p>
<p>Next VHDL Mode goes to buffer position 20 and asks for the
current column.  Since the <code>begin</code> keyword at buffer position 20 is
in column zero, it adds `<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>' to the running total.  Since there is
only one syntactic component on the list for this line, indentation
calculation is complete, and the total indentation for the line is 2
spaces. 
Simple, huh?

   </p>
<p>Actually, the mode usually just does The Right Thing without you having
to think about it in this much detail.  But when customizing
indentation, it's helpful to understand the general indentation model
being used.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-vhdl_002decho_002dsyntactic_002dinformation_002dp-21"></a><a name="index-echo_002dsyntactic_002dinformation_002dp-_0028vhdl_002d_0029-22"></a><a name="index-TAB-23"></a>To help you configure VHDL Mode, you can set the variable
<code>vhdl-echo-syntactic-information-p</code> to non-<code>nil</code> so that the
syntactic component list and calculated offset will always be echoed in
the minibuffer when you hit <kbd>TAB</kbd>.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Customizing-Indentation"></a></div>

<h2 class="chapter">4 Customizing Indentation</h2>

<p><a name="index-Customizing-Indentation-24"></a>
<a name="index-vhdl_002dset_002doffset-25"></a><a name="index-set_002doffset-_0028vhdl_002d_0029-26"></a>The <code>vhdl-offsets-alist</code> variable is where you customize all your
indentations.  You simply need to decide what additional offset you want
to add for every syntactic symbol.  You can use the command <kbd>C-c
O</kbd> (<code>vhdl-set-offset</code>) as the way to set offsets, both
interactively and from your mode hook.  Also, you can set up
<em>styles</em> of indentation.  Most likely, you'll find one of the
pre-defined styles will suit your needs, but if not, this section will
describe how to set up basic editing configurations.  See <a href="#Styles">Styles</a>, for
an explanation of how to set up named styles.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-vhdl_002dbasic_002doffset-27"></a><a name="index-basic_002doffset-_0028vhdl_002d_0029-28"></a>As mentioned previously, the variable <code>vhdl-offsets-alist</code> is an
association list between syntactic symbols and the offsets to be applied
for those symbols.  In fact, these offset values can be an integer, a
function or variable name, or one of the following symbols: <code>+</code>,
<code>-</code>, <code>++</code>, <code>--</code>, <code>*</code>, or <code>/</code>.  The symbol
values have the following meanings:

     </p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>+</code>  –  1 x <code>vhdl-basic-offset</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>-</code>  –  -1 x <code>vhdl-basic-offset</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>++</code> –  2 x <code>vhdl-basic-offset</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>--</code> –  -2 x <code>vhdl-basic-offset</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>*</code>  –  0.5 x <code>vhdl-basic-offset</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>/</code>  –  -0.5 x <code>vhdl-basic-offset</code>

   </li>
</ul>

<p class="noindent">So, for example, because most of the default offsets are defined in
terms of <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, and <code>0</code>, if you like the general
indentation style, but you use 2 spaces instead of 4 spaces per level,
you can probably achieve your style just by changing
<code>vhdl-basic-offset</code> like so (in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file):
</p>
<pre class="example">     
     (setq vhdl-basic-offset 2)
     
</pre>
   <p>To change indentation styles more radically, you will want to change the
value associated with the syntactic symbols in the
<code>vhdl-offsets-alist</code> variable.  First, I'll show you how to do that
interactively, then I'll describe how to make changes to your
<samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file so that your changes are more permanent.

<div class="node"><a name="Interactive-Customization"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">4.1 Interactive Customization</h3>

<p><a name="index-Interactive-Customization-29"></a>
As an example of how to customize indentation, let's change the
style of the example above from:
</p>
<pre class="example">     
       1: inverter : process
       2: begin
       3:   q &lt;= not d;
       4:   wait on d;
       5: end inverter;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">to:
</p>
<pre class="example">     
       1: inverter : process
       2: begin
       3:     q &lt;= not d;
       4:     wait on d;
       5: end inverter;
</pre>
   <p>In other words, we want to change the indentation of the statements
inside the inverter process.  Notice that the construct we want to
change starts on line 3.  To change the indentation of a line, we need
to see which syntactic component affect the offset calculations for that
line.  Hitting <kbd>C-c C-x</kbd> on line 3 yields:
</p>
<pre class="example">     
     ((statement-block-intro . 20))
     
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-vhdl_002dset_002doffset-30"></a><a name="index-set_002doffset-_0028vhdl_002d_0029-31"></a><a name="index-C_002dc-O-32"></a>So we know that to change the offset of the first signal assignment, we need to
change the indentation for the <code>statement-block-intro</code> syntactic
symbol.  To do this interactively, just hit <kbd>C-c O</kbd>
(<code>vhdl-set-offset</code>).  This prompts you for the syntactic symbol to
change, providing a reasonable default.  In this case, the default is
<code>statement-block-intro</code>, which is just the syntactic symbol we want to
change!

   </p>
<p>After you hit return, VHDL Mode will then prompt you for the new
offset value, with the old value as the default.  The default in this
case is `<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>', so hit backspace to delete the `<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>', then hit
`<samp><span class="samp">++</span></samp>' and <kbd>RET</kbd>.  This will associate an offset of twice the
basic indent with the syntactic symbol <code>statement-block-intro</code> in
the <code>vhdl-offsets-alist</code> variable.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-vhdl_002dindent_002ddefun-33"></a><a name="index-indent_002ddefun-_0028vhdl_002d_0029-34"></a>To check your changes quickly, just enter <kbd>M-x vhdl-indent-defun</kbd> to
reindent the entire function.  The example should now look like:
</p>
<pre class="example">     
       1: inverter : process
       2: begin
       3:     q &lt;= not d;
       4:     wait on d;
       5: end inverter;
</pre>
   <p>Notice how just changing the offset on line 3 is all we needed to do. 
Since the other affected lines are indented relative to line 3, they are
automatically indented the way you'd expect.  For more complicated
examples, this may not always work.  The general approach to take is to
always start adjusting offsets for lines higher up in the file, then
re-indent and see if any following lines need further adjustments.

<h3 class="section">4.2 Permanent Indentation</h3>

<p><a name="index-Permanent-Indentation-35"></a>
<a name="index-vhdl_002dmode_002dhook-36"></a><a name="index-hooks-37"></a>To make this change permanent, you need to add some lisp code to your
<samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file.  VHDL Mode provides a <code>vhdl-mode-hook</code>
that you can use to customize your language editing styles.  This hook
gets run as the last thing when you enter VHDL Mode.

   </p>
<p>Here's a simplified example of what you can add to your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>
file to make the changes described in the previous section
(<a href="#Interactive-Customization">Interactive Customization</a>) more permanent.  See the Emacs
manuals for more information on customizing Emacs via hooks.

<h3 class="section">4.3 Styles</h3>

<p><a name="index-Styles-38"></a>
Most people only need to edit code formatted in just a few well-defined
and consistent styles.  For example, their organization might impose a
“blessed” style that all its programmers must conform to.  Similarly,
people who work on GNU software will have to use the GNU coding style on
C code.  Some shops are more lenient, allowing some variety of coding
styles, and as programmers come and go, there could be a number of
styles in use.  For this reason, VHDL Mode makes it convenient for
you to set up logical groupings of customizations called <dfn>styles</dfn>,
associate a single name for any particular style, and pretty easily
start editing new or existing code using these styles.  This chapter
describes how to set up styles and how to edit your C code using styles.

<h4 class="subsection">4.3.1 Built-in Styles</h4>

<p><a name="index-Built_002din-Styles-39"></a>
If you're lucky, one of VHDL Mode's built-in styles might be just
what you're looking for.  Some of the most common VHDL styles are
already built-in.  These include:

     </p>
<ul>
<li>
<a name="index-IEEE-style-40"></a><code>GNU</code> – the coding style in the IEEE Language Reference Manual.

   </li>
</ul>

   <p><a name="index-vhdl_002dset_002dstyle-41"></a><a name="index-set_002dstyle-_0028vhdl_002d_0029-42"></a>If you'd like to experiment with these built-in styles you can simply
type <kbd>M-x vhdl-set-style RET</kbd> in a VHDL Mode buffer.

   </p>
<p>You will be prompted for one of the above styles (with completion). 
Enter one of the styles and hit <kbd>RET</kbd>.  Note however that setting a
style in this way does <em>not</em> automatically re-indent your file.

   </p>
<p>Once you find a built-in style you like, you can make the change
permanent by adding a call to your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file.  Let's say for
example that you want to use the <code>IEEE</code> style in all your
files.  You would add this:
</p>
<pre class="example">     
     (defun my-vhdl-mode-hook ()
       ;; use IEEE style for all VHDL code
       (vhdl-set-style "IEEE")
       ;; other customizations can go here
       )
     (add-hook 'vhdl-mode-hook 'my-vhdl-mode-hook)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">See <a href="#Permanent-Customization">Permanent Customization</a>.

<div class="node"><a name="Adding-Styles"></a></div>

<h4 class="subsection">4.3.2 Adding Styles</h4>

<p><a name="index-Adding-Styles-43"></a>
<a name="index-vhdl_002dstyle_002dalist-44"></a><a name="index-style_002dalist-_0028vhdl_002d_0029-45"></a><a name="index-vhdl_002dadd_002dstyle-46"></a><a name="index-add_002dstyle-_0028vhdl_002d_0029-47"></a>If none of the built-in styles is appropriate, you'll probably want to
add a new style definition.  Styles are kept in the <code>vhdl-style-alist</code>
variable, but you probably won't want to modify this variable directly. 
VHDL Mode provides a function, called <code>vhdl-add-style</code>, that you
can use to easily add new styles or update existing styles.  This
function takes two arguments, a <var>stylename</var> string, and an
association list <var>description</var> of style customizations.  If
<var>stylename</var> is not already in <code>vhdl-style-alist</code>, the new style is
added, otherwise the style already associated with <var>stylename</var> is
changed to the new <var>description</var>.  This function also takes an
optional third argument, which if non-<code>nil</code>, automatically
institutes the new style in the current buffer.

   </p>
<p>The sample <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file provides a concrete example of how a new
style can be added and automatically set.  See <a href="#Sample-Init-File">Sample Init File</a>.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="File-Styles"></a></div>

<h4 class="subsection">4.3.3 File Styles</h4>

<p><a name="index-File-Styles-48"></a>
<a name="index-local-variables-49"></a>The Emacs manual describes how you can customize certain variables on a
per-file basis by including a <dfn>Local Variable</dfn> block at the end of
the file.  So far, you've only seen a functional interface to
VHDL Mode, which is highly inconvenient for use in a Local Variable
block.  VHDL Mode provides two variables that make it easier for
you to customize your style on a per-file basis.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-vhdl_002dfile_002dstyle-50"></a><a name="index-file_002dstyle-_0028vhdl_002d_0029-51"></a><a name="index-vhdl_002dfile_002doffsets-52"></a><a name="index-file_002doffsets-_0028vhdl_002d_0029-53"></a>
The variable <code>vhdl-file-style</code> can be set to a style name string as
described in <a href="#Built_002din-Styles">Built-in Styles</a>.  When the file is visited,
VHDL Mode will automatically set the file's style to this style
using <code>vhdl-set-style</code>.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-vhdl_002doffsets_002dalist-54"></a><a name="index-offsets_002dalist-_0028vhdl_002d_0029-55"></a><a name="index-vhdl_002dset_002doffset-56"></a><a name="index-set_002doffset-_0028vhdl_002d_0029-57"></a>Another variable, <code>vhdl-file-offsets</code>, takes an association list
similar to what is allowed in <code>vhdl-offsets-alist</code>.  When the file is
visited, VHDL Mode will automatically institute these offsets using
<code>vhdl-set-offset</code>.  See <a href="#Customizing-Indentation">Customizing Indentation</a>.

   </p>
<p>Note that file style settings (i.e., <code>vhdl-file-style</code>) are applied
before file offset settings (i.e., <code>vhdl-file-offsets</code>).

very little need for customizations.  Usually, one of the standard
styles defined in <code>vhdl-style-alist</code> will do the trick.  Sometimes,
one of the syntactic symbol offsets will need to be tweaked slightly, or
perhaps <code>vhdl-basic-offset</code> will need to be changed.  However, some
styles require a more advanced ability for customization, and one of the
real strengths of VHDL Mode is that the syntactic analysis model
provides a very flexible framework for customizing indentation. This
allows you to perform special indentation calculations for situations
not handled by the mode directly.

<h4 class="subsection">4.4.1 Custom Indentation Functions</h4>

<p><a name="index-Custom-Indentation-Functions-63"></a>
<a name="index-custom-indentation-functions-64"></a>One of the most common ways to customize VHDL Mode is by writing
<dfn>custom indentation functions</dfn> and associating them with specific
syntactic symbols (see <a href="#Syntactic-Symbols">Syntactic Symbols</a>).  VHDL Mode itself
uses custom indentation functions to provide more sophisticated
indentation, for example when lining up selected signal assignments:
</p>
<pre class="example">     
     %%% TBD %%%
</pre>
   <p>In this example, the <code>statement-cont</code> syntactic symbol has an
offset of <code>+</code>, and <code>vhdl-basic-offset</code> is 2, so lines 4
through 6 are simply indented two spaces to the right of line 3.  But
perhaps we'd like VHDL Mode to be a little more intelligent so
that it offsets the waveform descriptions relative to the signal
assignment operator in line 3.  To do this, we have to write a custom
indentation function which finds the column of signal assignment
operator on the first line of the statement.  Here is the lisp code
(from the <samp><span class="file">vhdl-mode.el</span></samp> source file) that implements this:
</p>
<pre class="example">     
     (defun vhdl-lineup-statement-cont (langelem)
       ;; line up statement-cont after the assignment operator
       (save-excursion
         (let* ((relpos (cdr langelem))
     	   (assignp (save-excursion
     		     (goto-char (vhdl-point 'boi))
     		     (and (re-search-forward "\\(&lt;\\|:\\)="
     					     (vhdl-point 'eol) t)
     			  (- (point) (vhdl-point 'boi)))))
     	   (curcol (progn
     		     (goto-char relpos)
     		     (current-column)))
     	   foundp)
           (while (and (not foundp)
     		  (&lt; (point) (vhdl-point 'eol)))
     	(re-search-forward "\\(&lt;\\|:\\)=\\|(" (vhdl-point 'eol) 'move)
     	(if (vhdl-in-literal (cdr langelem))
     	    (forward-char)
     	  (if (= (preceding-char) ?\()
     	      ;; skip over any parenthesized expressions
     	      (goto-char (min (vhdl-point 'eol)
     			      (scan-lists (point) 1 1)))
     	    ;; found an assignment operator (not at eol)
     	    (setq foundp (not (looking-at "\\s-*$"))))))
           (if (not foundp)
     	  ;; there's no assignment operator on the line
     	  vhdl-basic-offset
     	;; calculate indentation column after assign and ws, unless
     	;; our line contains an assignment operator
     	(if (not assignp)
     	    (progn
     	      (forward-char)
     	      (skip-chars-forward " \t")
     	      (setq assignp 0)))
     	(- (current-column) assignp curcol))
           )))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Custom indent functions take a single argument, which is a syntactic
component cons cell (see <a href="#Syntactic-Analysis">Syntactic Analysis</a>).  The
function returns an integer offset value that will be added to the
running total indentation for the lne.  Note that what actually gets
returned is the difference between the column that the signal assignment
operator is on, and the column of the buffer relative position passed in
the function's argument.  Remember that VHDL Mode automatically
adds in the column of the component's relative buffer position and we
don't want that value added into the final total twice.

<code>statement-cont</code> syntactic symbol, we can add something like the
following to our <code>vhdl-mode-hook</code>:
</p>
<pre class="example">     
     (vhdl-set-offset 'statement-cont 'vhdl-lineup-statement-cont)
     
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-vhdl_002dindent_002ddefun-68"></a>Now the function looks like this after re-indenting (using <kbd>M-x
vhdl-indent-defun</kbd>):
</p>
<pre class="example">     
     %%% TBD %%%
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-vhdl_002doffsets_002dalist-69"></a><a name="index-offsets_002dalist-_0028vhdl_002d_0029-70"></a>Custom indentation functions can be as simple or as complex as you like,
and any syntactic symbol that appears in <code>vhdl-offsets-alist</code> can have
a custom indentation function associated with it.  Note however that
using many custom indentation functions may have a performance impact on
VHDL Mode.

<code>vhdl-special-indent-hook</code>.  This is a standard hook variable that
is called after every line is indented by VHDL Mode.  You can use
it to do any special indentation or line adjustments your style
dictates, such as adding extra indentation to the port map clause in a
component instantiation, etc.  Note however, that you should not change
<code>point</code> or <code>mark</code> inside your <code>vhdl-special-indent-hook</code>
functions.

symbol will contain the suffix <code>-open</code> or <code>-close</code>
respectively.

construct and lines that continue a construct, and the syntactic symbols

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>
     <ol type="1" start="0">
<li>PREAMBLE

     <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <dfn>free</dfn> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. 
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

     </p>
<p>This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

     </p>
<p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

     </p>
</li>
<li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     <p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The “Document”, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as “you”.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

     </p>
<p>A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

     </p>
<p>A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

     </p>
<p>The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

     </p>
<p>The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

     </p>
<p>A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. 
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

     </p>
<p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, SGML or XML using a publicly available
DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and
JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

     </p>
<p>The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title Page” means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     </p>
<p>The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.

     </p>
<p>A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as “Acknowledgements”,
“Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)  To “Preserve the Title”
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section “Entitled XYZ” according to this definition.

     </p>
<p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

     </p>
</li>
<li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     </p>
<p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     </p>
</li>
<li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     </p>
<p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     </p>
<p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. 
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

     </p>
<p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     </p>
</li>
<li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

          </p>
<ol type="A" start="1">
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

          </li>
<li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

          </li>
<li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

          </li>
<li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

          </li>
<li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

          </li>
<li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

          </li>
<li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

          </li>
<li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

          </li>
<li>Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled “History” in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

          </li>
<li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the “History” section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

          </li>
<li>For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

          </li>
<li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

          </li>
<li>Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

          </li>
<li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled “Endorsements” or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

          </li>
<li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          </li>
</ol>

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     </p>
<p>You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     </p>
<p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     </p>
<p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     </p>
</li>
<li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

     </p>
<p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     </p>
<p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled “History”
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
“History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You must delete all
sections Entitled “Endorsements.”

     </p>
</li>
<li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     </p>
<p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     </p>
</li>
<li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. 
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

     </p>
<p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. 
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

     </p>
</li>
<li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     </p>
<p>If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
“Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

     </p>
</li>
<li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     </p>
<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

     </p>
<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

     </p>
<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

     </p>
</li>
<li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

     </p>
<p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

     </p>
</li>
<li>RELICENSING

     <p>“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.

     </p>
<p>“CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

     </p>
<p>“Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.

     </p>
<p>An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

     </p>
<p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

        </p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="heading">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">       Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the “with<small class="dots">...</small>Texts.” line with this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">         with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being <var>list</var>.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   </p>
<p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
