<h2 class="unnumbered">Introduction</h2>

<p>You are reading about GNU Emacs, the GNU incarnation of the
advanced, self-documenting, customizable, extensible editor Emacs. 
(The `<samp><span class="samp">G</span></samp>' in
<!-- Workaround makeinfo 4 bug. -->
<!-- http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-texinfo/2004-08/msg00009.html -->
<acronym title="GNU's Not Unix">GNU</acronym> (GNU's Not Unix)
is not silent.)

   <p>We call Emacs <dfn>advanced</dfn> because it can do much more than simple
insertion and deletion of text.  It can control subprocesses, indent
programs automatically, show multiple files at once, and more. 
Emacs editing commands operate in terms of characters, words, lines,
sentences, paragraphs, and pages, as well as expressions and comments
in various programming languages.

   <p><dfn>Self-documenting</dfn> means that at any time you can use special
commands, known as <dfn>help commands</dfn>, to find out what your options
are, or to find out what any command does, or to find all the
commands that pertain to a given topic.  See <a href="#Help">Help</a>.

   <p><dfn>Customizable</dfn> means that you can easily alter the behavior of
Emacs commands in simple ways.  For instance, if you use a programming
language in which comments start with `<samp><span class="samp">&lt;**</span></samp>' and end with
`<samp><span class="samp">**&gt;</span></samp>', you can tell the Emacs comment manipulation commands to
use those strings (see <a href="#Comments">Comments</a>).  To take another example, you
can rebind the basic cursor motion commands (up, down, left and right)
to any keys on the keyboard that you find comfortable. 
See <a href="#Customization">Customization</a>.

   <p><dfn>Extensible</dfn> means that you can go beyond simple customization
and create entirely new commands.  New commands are simply programs
written in the Lisp language, which are run by Emacs's own Lisp
interpreter.  Existing commands can even be redefined in the middle of
an editing session, without having to restart Emacs.  Most of the
editing commands in Emacs are written in Lisp; the few exceptions
could have been written in Lisp but use C instead for efficiency. 
Writing an extension is programming, but non-programmers can use it
afterwards.  See <a href="eintr.html#Top">Emacs Lisp Intro</a>, if you want to learn Emacs
Lisp programming.

<h2 class="chapter">1 The Organization of the Screen</h2>

<p><a name="index-screen-1"></a><a name="index-frame-2"></a>
  On a graphical display, such as on GNU/Linux using the X Window
System, Emacs occupies a graphical window.  On a text terminal,
Emacs occupies the entire terminal screen.  We will use the term
<dfn>frame</dfn> to mean a graphical window or terminal screen occupied by
Emacs.  Emacs behaves very similarly on both kinds of frames.  It
normally starts out with just one frame, but you can create additional
frames if you wish (see <a href="#Frames">Frames</a>).

   <p>Each frame consists of several distinct regions.  At the top of the
frame is a <dfn>menu bar</dfn>, which allows you to access commands via a
series of menus.  On a graphical display, directly below the menu bar
is a <dfn>tool bar</dfn>, a row of icons that perform editing commands if
you click on them.  At the very bottom of the frame is an <dfn>echo
area</dfn>, where informative messages are displayed and where you enter
information when Emacs asks for it.

   <p>The main area of the frame, below the tool bar (if one exists) and
above the echo area, is called <dfn>the window</dfn>.  Henceforth in this
manual, we will use the word &ldquo;window&rdquo; in this sense.  Graphical
display systems commonly use the word &ldquo;window&rdquo; with a different
meaning; but, as stated above, we refer to those graphical windows
as &ldquo;frames&rdquo;.

   <p>An Emacs window is where the <dfn>buffer</dfn>&mdash;the text you are
editing&mdash;is displayed.  On a graphical display, the window possesses
a <dfn>scroll bar</dfn> on one side, which can be used to scroll through
the buffer.  The last line of the window is a <dfn>mode line</dfn>.  This
displays various information about what is going on in the buffer,
such as whether there are unsaved changes, the editing modes that are
in use, the current line number, and so forth.

   <p>When you start Emacs, there is normally only one window in the
frame.  However, you can subdivide this window horizontally or
vertically to create multiple windows, each of which can independently
display a buffer (see <a href="#Windows">Windows</a>).

   <p>At any time, one window is the <dfn>selected window</dfn>.  On a
graphical display, the selected window shows a more prominent cursor
(usually solid and blinking); other windows show a less prominent
cursor (usually a hollow box).  On a text terminal, there is only one
cursor, which is shown in the selected window.  The buffer displayed
in the selected window is called the <dfn>current buffer</dfn>, and it is
where editing happens.  Most Emacs commands implicitly apply to the
current buffer; the text displayed in unselected windows is mostly
visible for reference.  If you use multiple frames on a graphical
display, selecting a particular frame selects a window in that frame.

<h3 class="section">1.1 Point</h3>

<p><a name="index-point-3"></a><a name="index-cursor-4"></a>
  The cursor in the selected window shows the location where most
editing commands take effect, which is called <dfn>point</dfn><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a>.  Many Emacs commands move point
to different places in the buffer; for example, you can place point by
clicking mouse button 1 (normally the left button) at the desired
location.

   <p>By default, the cursor in the selected window is drawn as a solid
block and appears to be <em>on</em> a character, but you should think of
point as <em>between</em> two characters; it is situated <em>before</em>
the character under the cursor.  For example, if your text looks like
`<samp><span class="samp">frob</span></samp>' with the cursor over the `<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>', then point is between
the `<samp><span class="samp">o</span></samp>' and the `<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>'.  If you insert the character `<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>'
at that position, the result is `<samp><span class="samp">fro!b</span></samp>', with point between the
`<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>'  and the `<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>'.  Thus, the cursor remains over the
`<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>', as before.

   <p>If you are editing several files in Emacs, each in its own buffer,
each buffer has its own value of point.  A buffer that is not
currently displayed remembers its value of point if you later display
it again.  Furthermore, if a buffer is displayed in multiple windows,
each of those windows has its own value of point.

   <p>See <a href="#Cursor-Display">Cursor Display</a>, for options that control how Emacs displays
the cursor.

<h3 class="section">1.2 The Echo Area</h3>

<p><a name="index-echo-area-5"></a>
  The line at the very bottom of the frame is the <dfn>echo area</dfn>.  It
is used to display small amounts of text for various purposes.

   <p><a name="index-echoing-6"></a>  The echo area is so-named because one of the things it is used for
is <dfn>echoing</dfn>, which means displaying the characters of a
multi-character command as you type.  Single-character commands are
not echoed.  Multi-character commands (see <a href="#Keys">Keys</a>) are echoed if you
pause for more than a second in the middle of a command.  Emacs then
echoes all the characters of the command so far, to prompt you for the
rest.  Once echoing has started, the rest of the command echoes
immediately as you type it.  This behavior is designed to give
confident users fast response, while giving hesitant users maximum
feedback.

   <p><a name="index-error-message-7"></a><a name="index-echo-area-message-8"></a>  The echo area is also used to display an <dfn>error message</dfn> when a
command cannot do its job.  Error messages may be accompanied by
beeping or by flashing the screen.

   <p>Some commands display informative messages in the echo area to tell
you what the command has done, or to provide you with some specific
information.  These <dfn>informative</dfn> messages, unlike error messages,
are not accompanied with a beep or flash.  For example, <kbd>C-x =</kbd>
(hold down &lt;Ctrl&gt; and type <kbd>x</kbd>, then let go of &lt;Ctrl&gt; and
type <kbd>=</kbd>) displays a message describing the character at point,
its position in the buffer, and its current column in the window. 
Commands that take a long time often display messages ending in
`<samp><span class="samp">...</span></samp>' while they are working (sometimes also indicating how much
progress has been made, as a percentage), and add `<samp><span class="samp">done</span></samp>' when
they are finished.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007b_002aMessages_002a_007d-buffer-9"></a><a name="index-saved-echo-area-messages-10"></a><a name="index-messages-saved-from-echo-area-11"></a><a name="index-message_002dlog_002dmax-12"></a>  Informative echo area messages are saved in a special buffer named
<samp><span class="file">*Messages*</span></samp>.  (We have not explained buffers yet; see
<a href="#Buffers">Buffers</a>, for more information about them.)  If you miss a
message that appeared briefly on the screen, you can switch to the
<samp><span class="file">*Messages*</span></samp> buffer to see it again.  The <samp><span class="file">*Messages*</span></samp>
buffer is limited to a certain number of lines, specified by the
variable <code>message-log-max</code>.  (We have not explained variables
either; see <a href="#Variables">Variables</a>, for more information about them.)  Beyond
this limit, one line is deleted from the beginning whenever a new
message line is added at the end.

   <p>See <a href="#Display-Custom">Display Custom</a>, for options that control how Emacs uses the
echo area.

   <p><a name="index-minibuffer-13"></a>  The echo area is also used to display the <dfn>minibuffer</dfn>, a
special window where you can input arguments to commands, such as the
name of a file to be edited.  When the minibuffer is in use, the text
displayed in the echo area begins with a <dfn>prompt string</dfn>, and the
active cursor appears within the minibuffer, which is temporarily
considered the selected window.  You can always get out of the
minibuffer by typing <kbd>C-g</kbd>.  See <a href="#Minibuffer">Minibuffer</a>.

<h3 class="section">1.3 The Mode Line</h3>

<p><a name="index-mode-line-14"></a><a name="index-top-level-15"></a>
  At the bottom of each window is a <dfn>mode line</dfn>, which describes
what is going on in the current buffer.  When there is only one
window, the mode line appears right above the echo area; it is the
next-to-last line in the frame.  On a graphical display, the mode line
is drawn with a 3D box appearance.  Emacs also usually draws the mode
line of the selected window with a different color than that of
unselected windows, in order to make it stand out.

   <p>The text displayed in the mode line has the following format:

<pre class="example">      <var>cs</var>:<var>ch</var>-<var>fr</var>  <var>buf</var>      <var>pos</var> <var>line</var>   (<var>major</var> <var>minor</var>)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">On a text terminal, this text is followed by a series of dashes
extending to the right edge of the window.  These dashes are omitted
on a graphical display.

   <p>The <var>cs</var> string and the colon character after it describe the
character set and newline convention used for the current buffer. 
Normally, Emacs automatically handles these settings for you, but it
is sometimes useful to have this information.

   <p><var>cs</var> describes the character set of the text in the buffer
(see <a href="#Coding-Systems">Coding Systems</a>).  If it is a dash (`<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>'), that indicates
no special character set handling (with the possible exception of
end-of-line conventions, described in the next paragraph).  `<samp><span class="samp">=</span></samp>'
means no conversion whatsoever, and is usually used for files
containing non-textual data.  Other characters represent various
<dfn>coding systems</dfn>&mdash;for example, `<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>' represents ISO Latin-1.

   <p>On a text terminal, <var>cs</var> is preceded by two additional
characters that describe the coding systems for keyboard input and
terminal output.  Furthermore, if you are using an input method,
<var>cs</var> is preceded by a string that identifies the input method
(see <a href="#Input-Methods">Input Methods</a>).

   <p><a name="index-end_002dof_002dline-convention_002c-mode_002dline-indication-16"></a>  The character after <var>cs</var> is usually a colon.  If a different
string is displayed, that indicates a nontrivial end-of-line
convention for encoding a file.  Usually, lines of text are separated
by <dfn>newline characters</dfn> in a file, but two other conventions are
sometimes used.  The MS-DOS convention uses a carriage-return
character followed by a linefeed character; when editing such
files, the colon changes to either a backslash (`<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>') or
`<samp><span class="samp">(DOS)</span></samp>', depending on the operating system.  Another convention,
employed by older Macintosh systems, uses a carriage-return
character instead of a newline; when editing such files, the colon
changes to either a forward slash (`<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>') or `<samp><span class="samp">(Mac)</span></samp>'.  On some
systems, Emacs displays `<samp><span class="samp">(Unix)</span></samp>' instead of the colon for files
that use newline as the line separator.

   <p>The next element on the mode line is the string indicated by
<var>ch</var>.  This shows two dashes (`<samp><span class="samp">--</span></samp>') if the buffer displayed
in the window has the same contents as the corresponding file on the
disk; i.e., if the buffer is unmodified.  If the buffer is
modified, it shows two stars (`<samp><span class="samp">**</span></samp>').  For a read-only buffer, it
shows `<samp><span class="samp">%*</span></samp>' if the buffer is modified, and `<samp><span class="samp">%%</span></samp>' otherwise.

   <p>The character after <var>ch</var> is normally a dash (`<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>'). 
However, if the default-directory for the current buffer is on a
remote machine, `<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>' is displayed instead (see <a href="#File-Names">File Names</a>).

   <p><var>fr</var> gives the selected frame name (see <a href="#Frames">Frames</a>).  It appears
only on text terminals.  The initial frame's name is `<samp><span class="samp">F1</span></samp>'.

   <p><var>buf</var> is the name of the buffer displayed in the window. 
Usually, this is the same as the name of a file you are editing. 
See <a href="#Buffers">Buffers</a>.

   <p><var>pos</var> tells you whether there is additional text above the top
of the window, or below the bottom.  If your buffer is small and all
of it is visible in the window, <var>pos</var> is `<samp><span class="samp">All</span></samp>'.  Otherwise,
it is `<samp><span class="samp">Top</span></samp>' if you are looking at the beginning of the buffer,
`<samp><span class="samp">Bot</span></samp>' if you are looking at the end of the buffer, or
`<samp><var>nn</var><span class="samp">%</span></samp>', where <var>nn</var> is the percentage of the buffer above
the top of the window.  With Size Indication mode, you can display the
size of the buffer as well.  See <a href="#Optional-Mode-Line">Optional Mode Line</a>.

   <p><var>line</var> is the character `<samp><span class="samp">L</span></samp>' followed by the line number at
point.  (You can display the current column number too, by turning on
Column Number mode.  See <a href="#Optional-Mode-Line">Optional Mode Line</a>.)

   <p><var>major</var> is the name of the <dfn>major mode</dfn> used in the buffer. 
A major mode is a principal editing mode for the buffer, such as Text
mode, Lisp mode, C mode, and so forth.  See <a href="#Major-Modes">Major Modes</a>.  Some
major modes display additional information after the major mode name. 
For example, Compilation buffers and Shell buffers display the status
of the subprocess.

   <p><var>minor</var> is a list of some of the enabled <dfn>minor modes</dfn>,
which are optional editing modes that provide additional features on
top of the major mode.  See <a href="#Minor-Modes">Minor Modes</a>.

   <p>Some features are listed together with the minor modes whenever they
are turned on, even though they are not really minor modes. 
`<samp><span class="samp">Narrow</span></samp>' means that the buffer being displayed has editing
restricted to only a portion of its text (see <a href="#Narrowing">Narrowing</a>). 
`<samp><span class="samp">Def</span></samp>' means that a keyboard macro is currently being defined
(see <a href="#Keyboard-Macros">Keyboard Macros</a>).

   <p>In addition, if Emacs is inside a recursive editing level, square
brackets (`<samp><span class="samp">[...]</span></samp>') appear around the parentheses that
surround the modes.  If Emacs is in one recursive editing level within
another, double square brackets appear, and so on.  Since recursive
editing levels affect Emacs globally, such square brackets appear in
the mode line of every window.  See <a href="#Recursive-Edit">Recursive Edit</a>.

   <p>You can change the appearance of the mode line as well as the format
of its contents.  See <a href="#Optional-Mode-Line">Optional Mode Line</a>.  In addition, the mode
line is mouse-sensitive; clicking on different parts of the mode line
performs various commands.  See <a href="#Mode-Line-Mouse">Mode Line Mouse</a>.

<h3 class="section">1.4 The Menu Bar</h3>

<p><a name="index-menu-bar-17"></a>
  Each Emacs frame normally has a <dfn>menu bar</dfn> at the top which you
can use to perform common operations.  There's no need to list them
here, as you can more easily see them yourself.

   <p>On a display that supports a mouse, you can use the mouse to choose a
command from the menu bar.  An arrow on the right edge of a menu item
means it leads to a subsidiary menu, or <dfn>submenu</dfn>.  A `<samp><span class="samp">...</span></samp>'
at the end of a menu item means that the command will prompt you for
further input before it actually does anything.

   <p>Some of the commands in the menu bar have ordinary key bindings as
well; if so, a key binding is shown in parentheses after the item
itself.  To view the full command name and documentation for a menu
item, type <kbd>C-h k</kbd>, and then select the menu bar with the mouse in
the usual way (see <a href="#Key-Help">Key Help</a>).

   <p><a name="index-F10-18"></a><a name="index-menu_002dbar_002dopen-19"></a><a name="index-menu-bar-access-using-keyboard-20"></a>  Instead of using the mouse, you can also invoke the first menu bar
item by pressing &lt;F10&gt; (to run the command <code>menu-bar-open</code>). 
You can then navigate the menus with the arrow keys.  To activate a
selected menu item, press &lt;RET&gt;; to cancel menu navigation, press
<kbd>C-g</kbd> or <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; &lt;ESC&gt; &lt;ESC&gt;</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-M_002d_0060-21"></a><a name="index-tmm_002dmenubar-22"></a><a name="index-tty_002dmenu_002dopen_002duse_002dtmm-23"></a>  On a text terminal, you can optionally access the menu-bar menus in
the echo area.  To this end, customize the variable
<code>tty-menu-open-use-tmm</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> value.  Then typing
&lt;F10&gt; will run the command <code>tmm-menubar</code> instead of dropping
down the menu.  (You can also type <kbd>M-`</kbd>, which always invokes
<code>tmm-menubar</code>.)  <code>tmm-menubar</code> lets you select a menu item
with the keyboard.  A provisional choice appears in the echo area. 
You can use the up and down arrow keys to move through the menu to
different items, and then you can type &lt;RET&gt; to select the item. 
Each menu item is also designated by a letter or digit (usually the
initial of some word in the item's name).  This letter or digit is
separated from the item name by `<samp><span class="samp">==&gt;</span></samp>'.  You can type the item's
letter or digit to select the item.

<h2 class="chapter">2 Kinds of User Input</h2>

<p><a name="index-input-with-the-keyboard-24"></a><a name="index-keyboard-input-25"></a><a name="index-character-set-_0028keyboard_0029-26"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040acronym_007bASCII_007d-27"></a><a name="index-C_002d-28"></a><a name="index-Control-29"></a>
  GNU Emacs is primarily designed for use with the keyboard.  While it
is possible to use the mouse to issue editing commands through the
menu bar and tool bar, that is not as efficient as using the keyboard. 
Therefore, this manual mainly documents how to edit with the keyboard.

   <p><a name="index-control-character-30"></a>  Keyboard input into Emacs is based on a heavily-extended version of
<acronym>ASCII</acronym>.  Simple characters, like `<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">B</span></samp>',
`<samp><span class="samp">3</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">=</span></samp>', and the space character (denoted as &lt;SPC&gt;),
are entered by typing the corresponding key.  <dfn>Control
characters</dfn>, such as &lt;RET&gt;, &lt;TAB&gt;, &lt;DEL&gt;, &lt;ESC&gt;,
&lt;F1&gt;, &lt;Home&gt;, and &lt;LEFT&gt;, are also entered this way, as
are certain characters found on non-English keyboards
(see <a href="#International">International</a>).

   <p><a name="index-modifier-keys-31"></a><a name="index-Control-32"></a><a name="index-C_002d-33"></a><a name="index-META-34"></a><a name="index-M_002d-35"></a>  Emacs also recognizes control characters that are entered using
<dfn>modifier keys</dfn>.  Two commonly-used modifier keys are
&lt;Control&gt; (usually labeled &lt;Ctrl&gt;), and &lt;META&gt; (usually
labeled &lt;Alt&gt;)<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-3" name="fnd-3"><sup>3</sup></a>.  For example, <kbd>Control-a</kbd> is entered by
holding down the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key while pressing <kbd>a</kbd>; we will refer
to this as <kbd>C-a</kbd> for short.  Similarly <kbd>&lt;META&gt;-a</kbd>, or <kbd>M-a</kbd>
for short, is entered by holding down the &lt;Alt&gt; key and pressing
<kbd>a</kbd>.  Modifier keys can also be applied to non-alphanumerical
characters, e.g., <kbd>C-&lt;F1&gt;</kbd> or <kbd>M-&lt;LEFT&gt;</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040key_007bESC_007d-replacing-_0040key_007bMETA_007d-key-36"></a>  You can also type Meta characters using two-character sequences
starting with &lt;ESC&gt;.  Thus, you can enter <kbd>M-a</kbd> by typing
<kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; a</kbd>.  You can enter <kbd>C-M-a</kbd> by typing <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt;
C-a</kbd>.  Unlike &lt;META&gt;, &lt;ESC&gt; is entered as a separate
character.  You don't hold down &lt;ESC&gt; while typing the next
character; instead, press &lt;ESC&gt; and release it, then enter the
next character.  This feature is useful on certain text terminals
where the &lt;META&gt; key does not function reliably.

   <p><a name="index-keys-stolen-by-window-manager-37"></a><a name="index-window-manager_002c-keys-stolen-by-38"></a>  On graphical displays, the window manager might block some keyboard
inputs, including <kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>, <kbd>M-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>, <kbd>C-M-d</kbd>
and <kbd>C-M-l</kbd>.  If you have this problem, you can either customize
your window manager to not block those keys, or rebind the
affected Emacs commands (see <a href="#Customization">Customization</a>).

   <p><a name="index-input-event-39"></a>  Simple characters and control characters, as well as certain
non-keyboard inputs such as mouse clicks, are collectively referred to
as <dfn>input events</dfn>.  For details about how Emacs internally handles
input events, see <a href="elisp.html#Input-Events">Input Events</a>.

</div>

<h2 class="chapter">3 Keys</h2>

<p>Some Emacs commands are invoked by just one input event; for
example, <kbd>C-f</kbd> moves forward one character in the buffer.  Other
commands take two or more input events to invoke, such as <kbd>C-x
C-f</kbd> and <kbd>C-x 4 C-f</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-key-40"></a><a name="index-key-sequence-41"></a><a name="index-complete-key-42"></a><a name="index-prefix-key-43"></a>  A <dfn>key sequence</dfn>, or <dfn>key</dfn> for short, is a sequence of one
or more input events that is meaningful as a unit.  If a key sequence
invokes a command, we call it a <dfn>complete key</dfn>; for example,
<kbd>C-f</kbd>, <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> and <kbd>C-x 4 C-f</kbd> are all complete keys. 
If a key sequence isn't long enough to invoke a command, we call it a
<dfn>prefix key</dfn>; from the preceding example, we see that <kbd>C-x</kbd>
and <kbd>C-x 4</kbd> are prefix keys.  Every key sequence is either a
complete key or a prefix key.

   <p>A prefix key combines with the following input event to make a
longer key sequence.  For example, <kbd>C-x</kbd> is a prefix key, so
typing <kbd>C-x</kbd> alone does not invoke a command; instead, Emacs waits
for further input (if you pause for longer than a second, it echoes
the <kbd>C-x</kbd> key to prompt for that input; see <a href="#Echo-Area">Echo Area</a>). 
<kbd>C-x</kbd> combines with the next input event to make a two-event key
sequence, which could itself be a prefix key (such as <kbd>C-x 4</kbd>), or
a complete key (such as <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>).  There is no limit to the
length of key sequences, but in practice they are seldom longer than
three or four input events.

   <p>You can't add input events onto a complete key.  For example,
because <kbd>C-f</kbd> is a complete key, the two-event sequence <kbd>C-f
C-k</kbd> is two key sequences, not one.

   <p>By default, the prefix keys in Emacs are <kbd>C-c</kbd>, <kbd>C-h</kbd>,
<kbd>C-x</kbd>, <kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>, <kbd>C-x @</kbd>, <kbd>C-x a</kbd>, <kbd>C-x
n</kbd>, <kbd>C-x r</kbd>, <kbd>C-x v</kbd>, <kbd>C-x 4</kbd>, <kbd>C-x 5</kbd>, <kbd>C-x 6</kbd>,
&lt;ESC&gt;, <kbd>M-g</kbd>, and <kbd>M-o</kbd>.  (&lt;F1&gt; and &lt;F2&gt; are
aliases for <kbd>C-h</kbd> and <kbd>C-x 6</kbd>.)  This list is not cast in
stone; if you customize Emacs, you can make new prefix keys.  You
could even eliminate some of the standard ones, though this is not
recommended for most users; for example, if you remove the prefix
definition of <kbd>C-x 4</kbd>, then <kbd>C-x 4 C-f</kbd> becomes an invalid key
sequence.  See <a href="#Key-Bindings">Key Bindings</a>.

   <p>Typing the help character (<kbd>C-h</kbd> or &lt;F1&gt;) after a prefix key
displays a list of the commands starting with that prefix.  The sole
exception to this rule is &lt;ESC&gt;: <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; C-h</kbd> is equivalent
to <kbd>C-M-h</kbd>, which does something else entirely.  You can, however,
use &lt;F1&gt; to display a list of commands starting with &lt;ESC&gt;.

<h2 class="chapter">4 Keys and Commands</h2>

<p><a name="index-binding-44"></a><a name="index-command-45"></a>  This manual is full of passages that tell you what particular keys
do.  But Emacs does not assign meanings to keys directly.  Instead,
Emacs assigns meanings to named <dfn>commands</dfn>, and then gives keys
their meanings by <dfn>binding</dfn> them to commands.

   <p>Every command has a name chosen by a programmer.  The name is
usually made of a few English words separated by dashes; for example,
<code>next-line</code> or <code>forward-word</code>.  Internally, each command is
a special type of Lisp <dfn>function</dfn>, and the actions associated with
the command are performed by running the function.  See <a href="elisp.html#What-Is-a-Function">What Is a Function</a>.

   <p>The bindings between keys and commands are recorded in tables called
<dfn>keymaps</dfn>.  See <a href="#Keymaps">Keymaps</a>.

   <p>When we say that &ldquo;<kbd>C-n</kbd> moves down vertically one line&rdquo; we are
glossing over a subtle distinction that is irrelevant in ordinary use,
but vital for Emacs customization.  The command <code>next-line</code> does
a vertical move downward.  <kbd>C-n</kbd> has this effect <em>because</em> it
is bound to <code>next-line</code>.  If you rebind <kbd>C-n</kbd> to the command
<code>forward-word</code>, <kbd>C-n</kbd> will move forward one word instead.

   <p>In this manual, we will often speak of keys like <kbd>C-n</kbd> as
commands, even though strictly speaking the key is bound to a command. 
Usually we state the name of the command which really does the work in
parentheses after mentioning the key that runs it.  For example, we
will say that &ldquo;The command <kbd>C-n</kbd> (<code>next-line</code>) moves point
vertically down&rdquo;, meaning that the command <code>next-line</code> moves
vertically down, and the key <kbd>C-n</kbd> is normally bound to it.

   <p>Since we are discussing customization, we should tell you about
<dfn>variables</dfn>.  Often the description of a command will say, &ldquo;To
change this, set the variable <code>mumble-foo</code>.&rdquo;  A variable is a
name used to store a value.  Most of the variables documented in this
manual are meant for customization: some command or other part of
Emacs examines the variable and behaves differently according to the
value that you set.  You can ignore the information about variables
until you are interested in customizing them.  Then read the basic
information on variables (see <a href="#Variables">Variables</a>) and the information about
specific variables will make sense.

<h2 class="chapter">5 Entering Emacs</h2>

<p><a name="index-entering-Emacs-46"></a><a name="index-starting-Emacs-47"></a>
  The usual way to invoke Emacs is with the shell command
<samp><span class="command">emacs</span></samp>.  From a terminal window running in the X Window
System, you can run Emacs in the background with <samp><span class="command">emacs &amp;</span></samp>;
this way, Emacs won't tie up the terminal window, so you can use it to
run other shell commands.

   <p><a name="index-startup-screen-48"></a>  When Emacs starts up, the initial frame displays a special buffer
named `<samp><span class="samp">*GNU Emacs*</span></samp>'.  This <dfn>startup screen</dfn> contains
information about Emacs and <dfn>links</dfn> to common tasks that are
useful for beginning users.  For instance, activating the `<samp><span class="samp">Emacs
Tutorial</span></samp>' link opens the Emacs tutorial; this does the same thing as
the command <kbd>C-h t</kbd> (<code>help-with-tutorial</code>).  To activate a
link, either move point onto it and type <kbd>&lt;RET&gt;</kbd>, or click on
it with <kbd>mouse-1</kbd> (the left mouse button).

   <p>Using a command line argument, you can tell Emacs to visit one or
more files as soon as it starts up.  For example, <samp><span class="command">emacs
foo.txt</span></samp> starts Emacs with a buffer displaying the contents of the
file `<samp><span class="samp">foo.txt</span></samp>'.  This feature exists mainly for compatibility
with other editors, which are designed to be launched from the shell
for short editing sessions.  If you call Emacs this way, the initial
frame is split into two windows&mdash;one showing the specified file, and
the other showing the startup screen.  See <a href="#Windows">Windows</a>.

   <p>Generally, it is unnecessary and wasteful to start Emacs afresh each
time you want to edit a file.  The recommended way to use Emacs is to
start it just once, just after you log in, and do all your editing in
the same Emacs session.  See <a href="#Files">Files</a>, for information on visiting
more than one file.  If you use Emacs this way, the Emacs session
accumulates valuable context, such as the kill ring, registers, undo
history, and mark ring data, which together make editing more
convenient.  These features are described later in the manual.

   <p>To edit a file from another program while Emacs is running, you can
use the <samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp> helper program to open a file in the
existing Emacs session.  See <a href="#Emacs-Server">Emacs Server</a>.

   <p>Emacs accepts other command line arguments that tell it to load
certain Lisp files, where to put the initial frame, and so forth. 
See <a href="#Emacs-Invocation">Emacs Invocation</a>.

   <p><a name="index-inhibit_002dstartup_002dscreen-49"></a>  If the variable <code>inhibit-startup-screen</code> is non-<code>nil</code>,
Emacs does not display the startup screen.  In that case, if one or
more files were specified on the command line, Emacs simply displays
those files; otherwise, it displays a buffer named <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp>,
which can be used to evaluate Emacs Lisp expressions interactively. 
See <a href="#Lisp-Interaction">Lisp Interaction</a>.  You can set the variable
<code>inhibit-startup-screen</code> using the Customize facility
(see <a href="#Easy-Customization">Easy Customization</a>), or by editing your initialization file
(see <a href="#Init-File">Init File</a>).<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-4" name="fnd-4"><sup>4</sup></a>

   <p>You can also force Emacs to display a file or directory at startup
by setting the variable <code>initial-buffer-choice</code> to a string
naming that file or directory.  The value of
<code>initial-buffer-choice</code> may also be a function (of no arguments)
that should return a buffer which is then displayed. 
If <code>initial-buffer-choice</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, then if you specify
any files on the command line, Emacs still visits them, but does not
display them initially.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dc-54"></a><a name="index-save_002dbuffers_002dkill_002dterminal-55"></a>  <dfn>Killing</dfn> Emacs means terminating the Emacs program.  To do
this, type <kbd>C-x C-c</kbd> (<code>save-buffers-kill-terminal</code>).  A
two-character key sequence is used to make it harder to type by
accident.  If there are any modified file-visiting buffers when you
type <kbd>C-x C-c</kbd>, Emacs first offers to save these buffers.  If you
do not save them all, it asks for confirmation again, since the
unsaved changes will be lost.  Emacs also asks for confirmation if any
subprocesses are still running, since killing Emacs will also kill the
subprocesses (see <a href="#Shell">Shell</a>).

   <p><kbd>C-x C-c</kbd> behaves specially if you are using Emacs as a server. 
If you type it from a client frame, it closes the client
connection.  See <a href="#Emacs-Server">Emacs Server</a>.

   <p>Emacs can, optionally, record certain session information when you
kill it, such as the files you were visiting at the time.  This
information is then available the next time you start Emacs. 
See <a href="#Saving-Emacs-Sessions">Saving Emacs Sessions</a>.

non-<code>nil</code>, <kbd>C-x C-c</kbd> assumes that its value is a predicate
function, and calls that function.  If the result of the function call
is non-<code>nil</code>, the session is killed, otherwise Emacs continues to
run.  One convenient function to use as the value of
<code>confirm-kill-emacs</code> is the function <code>yes-or-no-p</code>.  The
default value of <code>confirm-kill-emacs</code> is <code>nil</code>.

<a href="elisp.html#Killing-Emacs">Killing Emacs</a>.

   <p><a name="index-kill_002demacs-57"></a>  To kill Emacs without being prompted about saving, type <kbd>M-x
kill-emacs</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dz-58"></a><a name="index-suspend_002dframe-59"></a><a name="index-minimizing-60"></a><a name="index-iconifying-61"></a><a name="index-suspending-62"></a>  <kbd>C-z</kbd> runs the command <code>suspend-frame</code>.  On a graphical
display, this command <dfn>minimizes</dfn> (or <dfn>iconifies</dfn>) the
selected Emacs frame, hiding it in a way that lets you bring it back
later (exactly how this hiding occurs depends on the window system). 
On a text terminal, the <kbd>C-z</kbd> command <dfn>suspends</dfn> Emacs,
stopping the program temporarily and returning control to the parent
process (usually a shell); in most shells, you can resume Emacs after
suspending it with the shell command <samp><span class="command">%emacs</span></samp>.

   <p>Text terminals usually listen for certain special characters whose
meaning is to kill or suspend the program you are running.  <b>This
terminal feature is turned off while you are in Emacs.</b>  The meanings
of <kbd>C-z</kbd> and <kbd>C-x C-c</kbd> as keys in Emacs were inspired by the
use of <kbd>C-z</kbd> and <kbd>C-c</kbd> on several operating systems as the
characters for stopping or killing a program, but that is their only
relationship with the operating system.  You can customize these keys
to run any commands of your choice (see <a href="#Keymaps">Keymaps</a>).

<h3 class="section">7.1 Inserting Text</h3>

<p><a name="index-insertion-65"></a><a name="index-graphic-characters-66"></a>  You can insert an ordinary <dfn>graphic character</dfn> (e.g., `<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>',
`<samp><span class="samp">B</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">3</span></samp>', and `<samp><span class="samp">=</span></samp>') by typing the associated key.  This
adds the character to the buffer at point.  Insertion moves point
forward, so that point remains just after the inserted text. 
See <a href="#Point">Point</a>.

   <p><a name="index-RET-67"></a><a name="index-C_002dj-68"></a><a name="index-newline-69"></a><!-- @findex electric-indent-just-newline -->
  To end a line and start a new one, type &lt;RET&gt; (<code>newline</code>). 
(The &lt;RET&gt; key may be labeled &lt;Return&gt; or &lt;Enter&gt; on your
keyboard, but we refer to it as &lt;RET&gt; in this manual.)  This
command inserts a newline character into the buffer, then indents
(see <a href="#Indentation">Indentation</a>) according to the major mode.  If point is at the end
of the line, the effect is to create a new blank line after it and
indent the new line; if point is in the middle of a line, the line is
split at that position.  To turn off the auto-indentation, you can
either disable Electric Indent mode (see <a href="#Indent-Convenience">Indent Convenience</a>) or
type <kbd>C-j</kbd>, which inserts just a newline, without any
auto-indentation.

   <p>As we explain later in this manual, you can change the way Emacs
handles text insertion by turning on <dfn>minor modes</dfn>.  For instance,
the minor mode called Auto Fill mode splits lines automatically when
they get too long (see <a href="#Filling">Filling</a>).  The minor mode called Overwrite
mode causes inserted characters to replace (overwrite) existing text,
instead of shoving it to the right.  See <a href="#Minor-Modes">Minor Modes</a>.

   <p><a name="index-quoting-70"></a><a name="index-C_002dq-71"></a><a name="index-quoted_002dinsert-72"></a>  Only graphic characters can be inserted by typing the associated
key; other keys act as editing commands and do not insert themselves. 
For instance, &lt;DEL&gt; runs the command <code>delete-backward-char</code>
by default (some modes bind it to a different command); it does not
insert a literal `<samp><span class="samp">DEL</span></samp>' character (<acronym>ASCII</acronym> character code
127).

   <p>To insert a non-graphic character, or a character that your keyboard
does not support, first <dfn>quote</dfn> it by typing <kbd>C-q</kbd>
(<code>quoted-insert</code>).  There are two ways to use <kbd>C-q</kbd>:

     <ul>
<li><kbd>C-q</kbd> followed by any non-graphic character (even <kbd>C-g</kbd>)
inserts that character.  For instance, <kbd>C-q &lt;DEL&gt;</kbd> inserts a
literal `<samp><span class="samp">DEL</span></samp>' character.

     <li><kbd>C-q</kbd> followed by a sequence of octal digits inserts the character
with the specified octal character code.  You can use any number of
octal digits; any non-digit terminates the sequence.  If the
terminating character is &lt;RET&gt;, that &lt;RET&gt; serves only to
terminate the sequence.  Any other non-digit terminates the sequence
and then acts as normal input&mdash;thus, <kbd>C-q 1 0 1 B</kbd> inserts
`<samp><span class="samp">AB</span></samp>'.

     <p>The use of octal sequences is disabled in ordinary non-binary
Overwrite mode, to give you a convenient way to insert a digit instead
of overwriting with it. 
</ul>

   <p><a name="index-read_002dquoted_002dchar_002dradix-73"></a>To use decimal or hexadecimal instead of octal, set the variable
<code>read-quoted-char-radix</code> to 10 or 16.  If the radix is 16,
the letters <kbd>a</kbd> to <kbd>f</kbd> serve as part of a character code,
just like digits.  Case is ignored.

   <p><a name="index-insert_002dchar-74"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-8-75"></a><a name="index-Unicode-characters_002c-inserting-76"></a><a name="index-insert-Unicode-character-77"></a><a name="index-characters_002c-inserting-by-name-or-code_002dpoint-78"></a><a name="index-curly-quotes-79"></a><a name="index-curved-quotes-80"></a>  A few common Unicode characters can be inserted via a command
starting with <kbd>C-x 8</kbd>.  For example, <kbd>C-x 8 [</kbd> inserts <tt>‘</tt>
which is Unicode code-point <code>U+2018</code> LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK,
sometimes called a left single &ldquo;curved quote&rdquo; or &ldquo;curly quote&rdquo;. 
Similarly, <kbd>C-x 8 ]</kbd>, <kbd>C-x 8 {</kbd> and <kbd>C-x 8 }</kbd> insert the
curved quotes <tt>’</tt>, <tt>“</tt> and <tt>”</tt>, respectively.  Also, a working
Alt key acts like <kbd>C-x 8</kbd>; e.g., <kbd>A-[</kbd> acts like <kbd>C-x 8 [</kbd>
and inserts <tt>‘</tt>.  To see which characters have <kbd>C-x 8</kbd>
shorthands, type <kbd>C-x 8 C-h</kbd>.

   <p>Alternatively, you can use the command <kbd>C-x 8 &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
(<code>insert-char</code>).  This prompts for the Unicode name or code-point
of a character, using the minibuffer.  If you enter a name, the
command provides completion (see <a href="#Completion">Completion</a>).  If you enter a
code-point, it should be as a hexadecimal number (the convention for
Unicode), or a number with a specified radix, e.g., <code>#o23072</code>
(octal); See <a href="elisp.html#Integer-Basics">Integer Basics</a>.  The command then inserts the corresponding character into
the buffer.

   <p>In some contexts, if you type a quotation using grave accent and
apostrophe <tt>`like this'</tt>, it is converted to a form <tt>‘like this’</tt>
using single quotation marks.  Similarly, typing a quotation <tt>&ldquo;like
this&rdquo;</tt> using double grave accent and apostrophe converts it to a form
<tt>“like this”</tt> using double quotation marks.  See <a href="#Quotation-Marks">Quotation Marks</a>.

   <p>For example, the following all insert the same character:

<pre class="example">     <kbd>C-x 8 &lt;RET&gt; left single quotation mark &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
     <kbd>C-x 8 &lt;RET&gt; left sin &lt;TAB&gt; &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
     <kbd>C-x 8 &lt;RET&gt; 2018 &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
     <kbd>C-x 8 [</kbd>
     <kbd>A-[</kbd>  <span class="roman">(if the Alt key works)</span>
     <kbd>`</kbd>    <span class="roman">(in Electric Quote mode)</span>
</pre>
   <p>A numeric argument to <kbd>C-q</kbd> or <kbd>C-x 8 ...</kbd> specifies
how many copies of the character to insert (see <a href="#Arguments">Arguments</a>).

<h3 class="section">7.2 Changing the Location of Point</h3>

<p><a name="index-arrow-keys-81"></a><a name="index-moving-point-82"></a><a name="index-movement-83"></a><a name="index-cursor-motion-84"></a><a name="index-moving-the-cursor-85"></a>  To do more than insert characters, you have to know how to move
point (see <a href="#Point">Point</a>).  The keyboard commands <kbd>C-f</kbd>, <kbd>C-b</kbd>,
<kbd>C-n</kbd>, and <kbd>C-p</kbd> move point to the right, left, down, and up,
respectively.  You can also move point using the <dfn>arrow keys</dfn>
present on most keyboards: &lt;RIGHT&gt;, &lt;LEFT&gt;,
&lt;DOWN&gt;, and &lt;UP&gt;; however, many Emacs users find
that it is slower to use the arrow keys than the control keys, because
you need to move your hand to the area of the keyboard where those
keys are located.

   <p>You can also click the left mouse button to move point to the
position clicked.  Emacs also provides a variety of additional
keyboard commands that move point in more sophisticated ways.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-f</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002df-86"></a><a name="index-forward_002dchar-87"></a>Move forward one character (<code>forward-char</code>).

exception: when editing right-to-left scripts such as Arabic, it
instead moves <em>backward</em> if the current paragraph is a
right-to-left paragraph.  See <a href="#Bidirectional-Editing">Bidirectional Editing</a>.  If
<code>visual-order-cursor-movement</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, this command
moves to the character that is to the right of the current screen
position, moving to the next or previous screen line as appropriate. 
Note that this might potentially move point many buffer positions
away, depending on the surrounding bidirectional context.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-b</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002db-92"></a><a name="index-backward_002dchar-93"></a>Move backward one character (<code>backward-char</code>).

(<code>move-to-window-line-top-bottom</code>).

     <p>A numeric argument says which screen line to place point on, counting
downward from the top of the window (zero means the top line).  A

also specify <var>n</var> by giving <kbd>M-g M-g</kbd> a numeric prefix argument. 
See <a href="#Select-Buffer">Select Buffer</a>, for the behavior of <kbd>M-g M-g</kbd> when you give it

for <kbd>C-n</kbd> and <kbd>C-p</kbd> (<code>set-goal-column</code>) in the current

always try to move to this column, or as close as possible to it,
after moving vertically.  The goal column remains in effect until
canceled.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-u C-x C-n</kbd><dd>Cancel the goal column.  Henceforth, <kbd>C-n</kbd> and <kbd>C-p</kbd> try to

</dl>

   <p><a name="index-line_002dmove_002dvisual-133"></a>  When a line of text in the buffer is longer than the width of the
window, Emacs usually displays it on two or more <dfn>screen lines</dfn>. 
For convenience, <kbd>C-n</kbd> and <kbd>C-p</kbd> move point by screen lines,
as do the equivalent keys <kbd>&lt;down&gt;</kbd> and <kbd>&lt;up&gt;</kbd>.  You
can force these commands to move according to <dfn>logical lines</dfn>
(i.e., according to the text lines in the buffer) by setting the
variable <code>line-move-visual</code> to <code>nil</code>; if a logical line
occupies multiple screen lines, the cursor then skips over the
additional screen lines.  For details, see <a href="#Continuation-Lines">Continuation Lines</a>. 
See <a href="#Variables">Variables</a>, for how to set variables such as
<code>line-move-visual</code>.

   <p>Unlike <kbd>C-n</kbd> and <kbd>C-p</kbd>, most of the Emacs commands that work
on lines work on <em>logical</em> lines.  For instance, <kbd>C-a</kbd>
(<code>move-beginning-of-line</code>) and <kbd>C-e</kbd>
(<code>move-end-of-line</code>) respectively move to the beginning and end
of the logical line.  Whenever we encounter commands that work on
screen lines, such as <kbd>C-n</kbd> and <kbd>C-p</kbd>, we will point these
out.

   <p><a name="index-track_002deol-134"></a>  When <code>line-move-visual</code> is <code>nil</code>, you can also set the
variable <code>track-eol</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> value.  Then <kbd>C-n</kbd>
and <kbd>C-p</kbd>, when starting at the end of the logical line, move to
the end of the next logical line.  Normally, <code>track-eol</code> is
<code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-next_002dline_002dadd_002dnewlines-135"></a>  <kbd>C-n</kbd> normally stops at the end of the buffer when you use it on
the last line in the buffer.  However, if you set the variable
<code>next-line-add-newlines</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> value, <kbd>C-n</kbd> on
the last line of a buffer creates an additional line at the end and
moves down into it.

   <p>The <kbd>&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd> (<code>delete-backward-char</code>) command removes
the character before point, moving the cursor and the characters after
it backwards.  If point was at the beginning of a line, this deletes
the preceding newline, joining this line to the previous one.

   <p>If, however, the region is active, <kbd>&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd> instead deletes
the text in the region.  See <a href="#Mark">Mark</a>, for a description of the region.

   <p>On most keyboards, &lt;DEL&gt; is labeled &lt;BACKSPACE&gt;, but we
refer to it as &lt;DEL&gt; in this manual.  (Do not confuse &lt;DEL&gt;
with the &lt;Delete&gt; key; we will discuss &lt;Delete&gt; momentarily.) 
On some text terminals, Emacs may not recognize the &lt;DEL&gt; key
properly.  See <a href="#DEL-Does-Not-Delete">DEL Does Not Delete</a>, if you encounter this problem.

   <p>The &lt;Delete&gt; (<code>delete-forward-char</code>) command deletes in the
opposite direction: it deletes the character after point, i.e., the
character under the cursor.  If point was at the end of a line, this
joins the following line onto this one.  Like <kbd>&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd>, it
deletes the text in the region if the region is active (see <a href="#Mark">Mark</a>).

   <p><kbd>C-d</kbd> (<code>delete-char</code>) deletes the character after point,
similar to &lt;Delete&gt;, but regardless of whether the region is
active.

   <p>See <a href="#Deletion">Deletion</a>, for more detailed information about the above
deletion commands.

   <p><kbd>C-k</kbd> (<code>kill-line</code>) erases (kills) a line at a time.  If
you type <kbd>C-k</kbd> at the beginning or middle of a line, it kills all
the text up to the end of the line.  If you type <kbd>C-k</kbd> at the end
of a line, it joins that line with the following line.

   <p>See <a href="#Killing">Killing</a>, for more information about <kbd>C-k</kbd> and related
commands.

<dt><kbd>C-/</kbd><dd>Undo one entry of the undo records&mdash;usually, one command worth
(<code>undo</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-x u</kbd><dt><kbd>C-_</kbd><dd>The same. 
</dl>

   <p>Emacs records a list of changes made in the buffer text, so you can
undo recent changes.  This is done using the <code>undo</code> command,
which is bound to <kbd>C-/</kbd> (as well as <kbd>C-x u</kbd> and <kbd>C-_</kbd>). 
Normally, this command undoes the last change, moving point back to
where it was before the change.  The undo command applies only to
changes in the buffer; you can't use it to undo cursor motion.

   <p>Although each editing command usually makes a separate entry in the
undo records, very simple commands may be grouped together. 
Sometimes, an entry may cover just part of a complex command.

   <p>If you repeat <kbd>C-/</kbd> (or its aliases), each repetition undoes
another, earlier change, back to the limit of the undo information
available.  If all recorded changes have already been undone, the undo
command displays an error message and does nothing.

   <p>To learn more about the <code>undo</code> command, see <a href="#Undo">Undo</a>.

<h3 class="section">7.5 Files</h3>

<p>Text that you insert in an Emacs buffer lasts only as long as the
Emacs session.  To keep any text permanently, you must put it in a
<dfn>file</dfn>.

   <p>Suppose there is a file named <samp><span class="file">test.emacs</span></samp> in your home
directory.  To begin editing this file in Emacs, type

<pre class="example">     C-x C-f test.emacs &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here the file name is given as an <dfn>argument</dfn> to the command <kbd>C-x
C-f</kbd> (<code>find-file</code>).  That command uses the <dfn>minibuffer</dfn> to
read the argument, and you type &lt;RET&gt; to terminate the argument
(see <a href="#Minibuffer">Minibuffer</a>).

   <p>Emacs obeys this command by <dfn>visiting</dfn> the file: it creates a
buffer, copies the contents of the file into the buffer, and then
displays the buffer for editing.  If you alter the text, you can
<dfn>save</dfn> the new text in the file by typing <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd>
(<code>save-buffer</code>).  This copies the altered buffer contents back
into the file <samp><span class="file">test.emacs</span></samp>, making them permanent.  Until you
save, the changed text exists only inside Emacs, and the file
<samp><span class="file">test.emacs</span></samp> is unaltered.

   <p>To create a file, just visit it with <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> as if it already
existed.  This creates an empty buffer, in which you can insert the
text you want to put in the file.  Emacs actually creates the file the
first time you save this buffer with <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd>.

   <p>To learn more about using files in Emacs, see <a href="#Files">Files</a>.

<h3 class="section">7.7 Blank Lines</h3>

<p><a name="index-inserting-blank-lines-140"></a><a name="index-deleting-blank-lines-141"></a>  Here are special commands and techniques for inserting and deleting
blank lines.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-o</kbd><dd>Insert a blank line after the cursor (<code>open-line</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x C-o</kbd><dd>Delete all but one of many consecutive blank lines
(<code>delete-blank-lines</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002do-142"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002do-143"></a><a name="index-blank-lines-144"></a><a name="index-open_002dline-145"></a><a name="index-delete_002dblank_002dlines-146"></a>  We have seen how <kbd>&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> (<code>newline</code>) starts a new line
of text.  However, it may be easier to see what you are doing if you
first make a blank line and then insert the desired text into it. 
This is easy to do using the key <kbd>C-o</kbd> (<code>open-line</code>), which
inserts a newline after point but leaves point in front of the
newline.  After <kbd>C-o</kbd>, type the text for the new line.

   <p>You can make several blank lines by typing <kbd>C-o</kbd> several times, or
by giving it a numeric argument specifying how many blank lines to make. 
See <a href="#Arguments">Arguments</a>, for how.  If you have a fill prefix, the <kbd>C-o</kbd>
command inserts the fill prefix on the new line, if typed at the
beginning of a line.  See <a href="#Fill-Prefix">Fill Prefix</a>.

   <p>The easy way to get rid of extra blank lines is with the command
<kbd>C-x C-o</kbd> (<code>delete-blank-lines</code>).  If point lies within a run
of several blank lines, <kbd>C-x C-o</kbd> deletes all but one of them.  If
point is on a single blank line, <kbd>C-x C-o</kbd> deletes it.  If point
is on a nonblank line, <kbd>C-x C-o</kbd> deletes all following blank
lines, if any exists.

<h3 class="section">7.8 Continuation Lines</h3>

<p><a name="index-continuation-line-147"></a><a name="index-wrapping-148"></a><a name="index-line-wrapping-149"></a><a name="index-fringes_002c-and-continuation-lines-150"></a>  Sometimes, a line of text in the buffer&mdash;a <dfn>logical line</dfn>&mdash;is
too long to fit in the window, and Emacs displays it as two or more
<dfn>screen lines</dfn>.  This is called <dfn>line wrapping</dfn> or
<dfn>continuation</dfn>, and the long logical line is called a
<dfn>continued line</dfn>.  On a graphical display, Emacs indicates line
wrapping with small bent arrows in the left and right window fringes. 
On a text terminal, Emacs indicates line wrapping by displaying a
`<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>' character at the right margin.

   <p>Most commands that act on lines act on logical lines, not screen
lines.  For instance, <kbd>C-k</kbd> kills a logical line.  As described
earlier, <kbd>C-n</kbd> (<code>next-line</code>) and <kbd>C-p</kbd>
(<code>previous-line</code>) are special exceptions: they move point down
and up, respectively, by one screen line (see <a href="#Moving-Point">Moving Point</a>).

   <p><a name="index-truncation-151"></a><a name="index-line-truncation_002c-and-fringes-152"></a>  Emacs can optionally <dfn>truncate</dfn> long logical lines instead of
continuing them.  This means that every logical line occupies a single
screen line; if it is longer than the width of the window, the rest of
the line is not displayed.  On a graphical display, a truncated line
is indicated by a small straight arrow in the right fringe; on a text
terminal, it is indicated by a `<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>' character in the right margin. 
See <a href="#Line-Truncation">Line Truncation</a>.

   <p>By default, continued lines are wrapped at the right window edge. 
Since the wrapping may occur in the middle of a word, continued lines
can be difficult to read.  The usual solution is to break your lines
before they get too long, by inserting newlines.  If you prefer, you
can make Emacs insert a newline automatically when a line gets too
long, by using Auto Fill mode.  See <a href="#Filling">Filling</a>.

   <p><a name="index-word-wrap-153"></a>  Sometimes, you may need to edit files containing many long logical
lines, and it may not be practical to break them all up by adding
newlines.  In that case, you can use Visual Line mode, which enables
<dfn>word wrapping</dfn>: instead of wrapping long lines exactly at the
right window edge, Emacs wraps them at the word boundaries (i.e.,
space or tab characters) nearest to the right window edge.  Visual
Line mode also redefines editing commands such as <code>C-a</code>,
<code>C-n</code>, and <code>C-k</code> to operate on screen lines rather than
logical lines.  See <a href="#Visual-Line-Mode">Visual Line Mode</a>.

<h3 class="section">7.9 Cursor Position Information</h3>

<p>Here are commands to get information about the size and position of
parts of the buffer, and to count words and lines.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-x what-line</kbd><dd>Display the line number of point. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x line-number-mode</kbd><dt><kbd>M-x column-number-mode</kbd><dd>Toggle automatic display of the current line number or column number. 
See <a href="#Optional-Mode-Line">Optional Mode Line</a>.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-=</kbd><dd>Display the number of lines, words, and characters that are present in
the region (<code>count-words-region</code>).  See <a href="#Mark">Mark</a>, for information
about the region.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x count-words</kbd><dd>Display the number of lines, words, and characters that are present in
the buffer.  If the region is active (see <a href="#Mark">Mark</a>), display the
numbers for the region instead.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-x =</kbd><dd>Display the character code of character after point, character position of
point, and column of point (<code>what-cursor-position</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x hl-line-mode</kbd><dd>Enable or disable highlighting of the current line.  See <a href="#Cursor-Display">Cursor Display</a>. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x size-indication-mode</kbd><dd>Toggle automatic display of the size of the buffer. 
See <a href="#Optional-Mode-Line">Optional Mode Line</a>. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-what_002dline-154"></a><a name="index-line-number-commands-155"></a><a name="index-location-of-point-156"></a><a name="index-cursor-location-157"></a><a name="index-point-location-158"></a>  <kbd>M-x what-line</kbd> displays the current line number in the echo
area.  This command is usually redundant, because the current line
number is shown in the mode line (see <a href="#Mode-Line">Mode Line</a>).  However, if you
narrow the buffer, the mode line shows the line number relative to
the accessible portion (see <a href="#Narrowing">Narrowing</a>).  By contrast,
<code>what-line</code> displays both the line number relative to the
narrowed region and the line number relative to the whole buffer.

   <p><a name="index-M_002d_003d-159"></a><a name="index-count_002dwords_002dregion-160"></a>  <kbd>M-=</kbd> (<code>count-words-region</code>) displays a message reporting
the number of lines, words, and characters in the region
(see <a href="#Mark">Mark</a>, for an explanation of the region).  With a prefix
argument, <kbd>C-u M-=</kbd>, the command displays a count for the entire
buffer.

   <p><a name="index-count_002dwords-161"></a>  The command <kbd>M-x count-words</kbd> does the same job, but with a
different calling convention.  It displays a count for the region if
the region is active, and for the buffer otherwise.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-_003d-162"></a><a name="index-what_002dcursor_002dposition-163"></a>  The command <kbd>C-x =</kbd> (<code>what-cursor-position</code>) shows
information about the current cursor position and the buffer contents
at that position.  It displays a line in the echo area that looks like
this:

<pre class="smallexample">     Char: c (99, #o143, #x63) point=28062 of 36168 (78%) column=53
</pre>
   <p>After `<samp><span class="samp">Char:</span></samp>', this shows the character in the buffer at point. 
The text inside the parenthesis shows the corresponding decimal, octal
and hex character codes; for more information about how <kbd>C-x =</kbd>
displays character information, see <a href="#International-Chars">International Chars</a>.  After
`<samp><span class="samp">point=</span></samp>' is the position of point as a character count (the first
character in the buffer is position 1, the second character is
position 2, and so on).  The number after that is the total number of
characters in the buffer, and the number in parenthesis expresses the
position as a percentage of the total.  After `<samp><span class="samp">column=</span></samp>' is the
horizontal position of point, in columns counting from the left edge
of the window.

   <p>If the buffer has been narrowed, making some of the text at the
beginning and the end temporarily inaccessible, <kbd>C-x =</kbd> displays
additional text describing the currently accessible range.  For
example, it might display this:

<pre class="smallexample">     Char: C (67, #o103, #x43) point=252 of 889 (28%) &lt;231-599&gt; column=0
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where the two extra numbers give the smallest and largest character
position that point is allowed to assume.  The characters between
those two positions are the accessible ones.  See <a href="#Narrowing">Narrowing</a>.

<h3 class="section">7.10 Numeric Arguments</h3>

<p><a name="index-numeric-arguments-164"></a><a name="index-prefix-arguments-165"></a><a name="index-arguments-to-commands-166"></a>
  In the terminology of mathematics and computing, <dfn>argument</dfn>
means &ldquo;data provided to a function or operation&rdquo;.  You can give any
Emacs command a <dfn>numeric argument</dfn> (also called a <dfn>prefix
argument</dfn>).  Some commands interpret the argument as a repetition
count.  For example, giving <kbd>C-f</kbd> an argument of ten causes it to
move point forward by ten characters instead of one.  With these
commands, no argument is equivalent to an argument of one, and
negative arguments cause them to move or act in the opposite
direction.

   <p><a name="index-M_002d1-167"></a><a name="index-M_002d_0040t_007b_002d_007d-168"></a><a name="index-digit_002dargument-169"></a><a name="index-negative_002dargument-170"></a>  The easiest way to specify a numeric argument is to type a digit
and/or a minus sign while holding down the &lt;META&gt; key.  For
example,

<pre class="example">     M-5 C-n
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">moves down five lines.  The keys <kbd>M-1</kbd>, <kbd>M-2</kbd>, and so on, as
well as <kbd>M--</kbd>, are bound to commands (<code>digit-argument</code> and
<code>negative-argument</code>) that set up an argument for the next
command.  <kbd>M--</kbd> without digits normally means &minus;1.

   <p>If you enter more than one digit, you need not hold down the
&lt;META&gt; key for the second and subsequent digits.  Thus, to move
down fifty lines, type

<pre class="example">     M-5 0 C-n
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Note that this <em>does not</em> insert five copies of `<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>' and move
down one line, as you might expect&mdash;the `<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>' is treated as part
of the prefix argument.

   <p>(What if you do want to insert five copies of `<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>'?  Type <kbd>M-5
C-u 0</kbd>.  Here, <kbd>C-u</kbd> terminates the prefix argument, so that
the next keystroke begins the command that you want to execute.  Note
that this meaning of <kbd>C-u</kbd> applies only to this case.  For the
usual role of <kbd>C-u</kbd>, see below.)

   <p><a name="index-C_002du-171"></a><a name="index-universal_002dargument-172"></a>  Instead of typing <kbd>M-1</kbd>, <kbd>M-2</kbd>, and so on, another way to
specify a numeric argument is to type <kbd>C-u</kbd>
(<code>universal-argument</code>) followed by some digits, or (for a
negative argument) a minus sign followed by digits.  A minus sign
without digits normally means &minus;1.

   <p><kbd>C-u</kbd> alone has the special meaning of &ldquo;four times&rdquo;: it
multiplies the argument for the next command by four.  <kbd>C-u C-u</kbd>
multiplies it by sixteen.  Thus, <kbd>C-u C-u C-f</kbd> moves forward
sixteen characters.  Other useful combinations are <kbd>C-u C-n</kbd>,
<kbd>C-u C-u C-n</kbd> (move down a good fraction of a screen), <kbd>C-u
C-u C-o</kbd> (make sixteen blank lines), and <kbd>C-u C-k</kbd> (kill four
lines).

   <p>You can use a numeric argument before a self-inserting character to
insert multiple copies of it.  This is straightforward when the
character is not a digit; for example, <kbd>C-u 6 4 a</kbd> inserts 64
copies of the character `<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>'.  But this does not work for
inserting digits; <kbd>C-u 6 4 1</kbd> specifies an argument of 641.  You
can separate the argument from the digit to insert with another
<kbd>C-u</kbd>; for example, <kbd>C-u 6 4 C-u 1</kbd> does insert 64 copies of
the character `<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>'.

   <p>Some commands care whether there is an argument, but ignore its
value.  For example, the command <kbd>M-q</kbd> (<code>fill-paragraph</code>)
fills text; with an argument, it justifies the text as well. 
(See <a href="#Filling">Filling</a>, for more information on <kbd>M-q</kbd>.)  For these
commands, it is enough to specify the argument with a single
<kbd>C-u</kbd>.

   <p>Some commands use the value of the argument as a repeat count, but
do something special when there is no argument.  For example, the
command <kbd>C-k</kbd> (<code>kill-line</code>) with argument <var>n</var> kills
<var>n</var> lines, including their terminating newlines.  But <kbd>C-k</kbd>
with no argument is special: it kills the text up to the next newline,
or, if point is right at the end of the line, it kills the newline
itself.  Thus, two <kbd>C-k</kbd> commands with no arguments can kill a
nonblank line, just like <kbd>C-k</kbd> with an argument of one. 
(See <a href="#Killing">Killing</a>, for more information on <kbd>C-k</kbd>.)

   <p>A few commands treat a plain <kbd>C-u</kbd> differently from an ordinary
argument.  A few others may treat an argument of just a minus sign
differently from an argument of &minus;1.  These unusual cases are
described when they come up; they exist to make an individual command
more convenient, and they are documented in that command's
documentation string.

   <p>We use the term <dfn>prefix argument</dfn> to emphasize that you type
such arguments before the command, and to distinguish them from
minibuffer arguments (see <a href="#Minibuffer">Minibuffer</a>), which are entered after
invoking the command.

<h3 class="section">7.11 Repeating a Command</h3>

<p><a name="index-repeating-a-command-173"></a>
  Many simple commands, such as those invoked with a single key or
with <kbd>M-x </kbd><var>command-name</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>, can be repeated by
invoking them with a numeric argument that serves as a repeat count
(see <a href="#Arguments">Arguments</a>).  However, if the command you want to repeat
prompts for input, or uses a numeric argument in another way, that
method won't work.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-z-174"></a><a name="index-repeat-175"></a>  The command <kbd>C-x z</kbd> (<code>repeat</code>) provides another way to repeat
an Emacs command many times.  This command repeats the previous Emacs
command, whatever that was.  Repeating a command uses the same arguments
that were used before; it does not read new arguments each time.

   <p>To repeat the command more than once, type additional <kbd>z</kbd>'s: each
<kbd>z</kbd> repeats the command one more time.  Repetition ends when you
type a character other than <kbd>z</kbd>, or press a mouse button.

   <p>For example, suppose you type <kbd>C-u 2 0 C-d</kbd> to delete 20
characters.  You can repeat that command (including its argument) three
additional times, to delete a total of 80 characters, by typing <kbd>C-x
z z z</kbd>.  The first <kbd>C-x z</kbd> repeats the command once, and each
subsequent <kbd>z</kbd> repeats it once again.

<h2 class="chapter">8 The Minibuffer</h2>

<p><a name="index-minibuffer-176"></a>
  The <dfn>minibuffer</dfn> is where Emacs commands read complicated
arguments, such as file names, buffer names, Emacs command names, or
Lisp expressions.  We call it the &ldquo;minibuffer&rdquo; because it's a
special-purpose buffer with a small amount of screen space.  You can
use the usual Emacs editing commands in the minibuffer to edit the
argument text.

<h3 class="section">8.1 Using the Minibuffer</h3>

<p><a name="index-prompt-177"></a>  When the minibuffer is in use, it appears in the echo area, with a
cursor.  The minibuffer starts with a <dfn>prompt</dfn>, usually ending
with a colon.  The prompt states what kind of input is expected, and
how it will be used.  The prompt is highlighted using the
<code>minibuffer-prompt</code> face (see <a href="#Faces">Faces</a>).

   <p>The simplest way to enter a minibuffer argument is to type the text,
then &lt;RET&gt; to submit the argument and exit the minibuffer. 
Alternatively, you can type <kbd>C-g</kbd> to exit the minibuffer by
canceling the command asking for the argument (see <a href="#Quitting">Quitting</a>).

   <p><a name="index-default-argument-178"></a>  Sometimes, the prompt shows a <dfn>default argument</dfn>, inside
parentheses before the colon.  This default will be used as the
argument if you just type &lt;RET&gt;.  For example, commands that read
buffer names usually show a buffer name as the default; you can type
&lt;RET&gt; to operate on that default buffer.

   <p><a name="index-Minibuffer-Electric-Default-mode-179"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Minibuffer-Electric-Default-180"></a><a name="index-minibuffer_002delectric_002ddefault_002dmode-181"></a><a name="index-minibuffer_002deldef_002dshorten_002ddefault-182"></a>  If you enable Minibuffer Electric Default mode, a global minor mode,
Emacs hides the default argument as soon as you modify the contents of
the minibuffer (since typing &lt;RET&gt; would no longer submit that
default).  If you ever bring back the original minibuffer text, the
prompt again shows the default.  Furthermore, if you change the
variable <code>minibuffer-eldef-shorten-default</code> to a non-<code>nil</code>
value, the default argument is displayed as `<samp><span class="samp">[</span><var>default</var><span class="samp">]</span></samp>'
instead of `<samp><span class="samp">(default </span><var>default</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>', saving some screen space. 
To enable this minor mode, type <kbd>M-x
minibuffer-electric-default-mode</kbd>.

   <p>Since the minibuffer appears in the echo area, it can conflict with
other uses of the echo area.  If an error message or an informative
message is emitted while the minibuffer is active, the message hides
the minibuffer for a few seconds, or until you type something; then
the minibuffer comes back.  While the minibuffer is in use, keystrokes
do not echo.

<h3 class="section">8.2 Minibuffers for File Names</h3>

<p><a name="index-default-directory-183"></a>  Commands such as <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> (<code>find-file</code>) use the minibuffer
to read a file name argument (see <a href="#Basic-Files">Basic Files</a>).  When the
minibuffer is used to read a file name, it typically starts out with
some initial text ending in a slash.  This is the <dfn>default
directory</dfn>.  For example, it may start out like this:

<pre class="example">     Find file: /u2/emacs/src/
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here, `<samp><span class="samp">Find file: </span></samp>' is the prompt and `<samp><span class="samp">/u2/emacs/src/</span></samp>' is
the default directory.  If you now type <kbd>buffer.c</kbd> as input, that
specifies the file <samp><span class="file">/u2/emacs/src/buffer.c</span></samp>.  See <a href="#File-Names">File Names</a>,
for information about the default directory.

   <p>You can specify the parent directory with <samp><span class="file">..</span></samp>:
<samp><span class="file">/a/b/../foo.el</span></samp> is equivalent to <samp><span class="file">/a/foo.el</span></samp>. 
Alternatively, you can use <kbd>M-&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd> to kill directory names
backwards (see <a href="#Words">Words</a>).

   <p>To specify a file in a completely different directory, you can kill
the entire default with <kbd>C-a C-k</kbd> (see <a href="#Minibuffer-Edit">Minibuffer Edit</a>). 
Alternatively, you can ignore the default, and enter an absolute file
name starting with a slash or a tilde after the default directory. 
For example, you can specify <samp><span class="file">/etc/termcap</span></samp> as follows:

<pre class="example">     Find file: /u2/emacs/src//etc/termcap
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><a name="index-g_t_002f_002f-in-file-name-184"></a><a name="index-double-slash-in-file-name-185"></a><a name="index-slashes-repeated-in-file-name-186"></a><a name="index-file_002dname_002dshadow_002dmode-187"></a>A double slash causes Emacs to ignore everything before the
second slash in the pair.  In the example above,
<samp><span class="file">/u2/emacs/src/</span></samp> is ignored, so the argument you supplied is
<samp><span class="file">/etc/termcap</span></samp>.  The ignored part of the file name is dimmed if
the terminal allows it.  (To disable this dimming, turn off File Name
Shadow mode with the command <kbd>M-x file-name-shadow-mode</kbd>.)

   <p><a name="index-home-directory-shorthand-188"></a>  Emacs interprets <samp><span class="file">~/</span></samp> as your home directory.  Thus,
<samp><span class="file">~/foo/bar.txt</span></samp> specifies a file named <samp><span class="file">bar.txt</span></samp>, inside a
directory named <samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp>, which is in turn located in your home
directory.  In addition, <samp><span class="file">~</span><var>user-id</var><span class="file">/</span></samp> means the home
directory of a user whose login name is <var>user-id</var>.  Any leading
directory name in front of the <samp><span class="file">~</span></samp> is ignored: thus,
<samp><span class="file">/u2/emacs/~/foo/bar.txt</span></samp> is equivalent to <samp><span class="file">~/foo/bar.txt</span></samp>.

   <p>On MS-Windows and MS-DOS systems, where a user doesn't always have a
home directory, Emacs uses several alternatives.  For MS-Windows, see
<a href="#Windows-HOME">Windows HOME</a>; for MS-DOS, see
<a href="#MS_002dDOS-File-Names">MS-DOS File Names</a>. 
On these systems, the <samp><span class="file">~</span><var>user-id</var><span class="file">/</span></samp> construct is supported
only for the current user, i.e., only if <var>user-id</var> is the current
user's login name.

   <p><a name="index-insert_002ddefault_002ddirectory-189"></a>  To prevent Emacs from inserting the default directory when reading
file names, change the variable <code>insert-default-directory</code> to
<code>nil</code>.  In that case, the minibuffer starts out empty. 
Nonetheless, relative file name arguments are still interpreted based
on the same default directory.

   <p>You can also enter remote file names in the minibuffer. 
See <a href="#Remote-Files">Remote Files</a>.

<h3 class="section">8.3 Editing in the Minibuffer</h3>

<p>The minibuffer is an Emacs buffer, albeit a peculiar one, and the
usual Emacs commands are available for editing the argument text. 
(The prompt, however, is <dfn>read-only</dfn>, and cannot be changed.)

   <p>Since &lt;RET&gt; in the minibuffer submits the argument, you can't
use it to insert a newline.  You can do that with <kbd>C-q C-j</kbd>, which
inserts a <kbd>C-j</kbd> control character, which is formally equivalent to
a newline character (see <a href="#Inserting-Text">Inserting Text</a>).  Alternatively, you can
use the <kbd>C-o</kbd> (<code>open-line</code>) command (see <a href="#Blank-Lines">Blank Lines</a>).

   <p>Inside a minibuffer, the keys &lt;TAB&gt;, &lt;SPC&gt;, and <kbd>?</kbd> are
often bound to <dfn>completion commands</dfn>, which allow you to easily
fill in the desired text without typing all of it.  See <a href="#Completion">Completion</a>. 
As with &lt;RET&gt;, you can use <kbd>C-q</kbd> to insert a &lt;TAB&gt;,
&lt;SPC&gt;, or `<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>'  character.

   <p>For convenience, <kbd>C-a</kbd> (<code>move-beginning-of-line</code>) in a
minibuffer moves point to the beginning of the argument text, not the
beginning of the prompt.  For example, this allows you to erase the
entire argument with <kbd>C-a C-k</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-height-of-minibuffer-190"></a><a name="index-size-of-minibuffer-191"></a><a name="index-growing-minibuffer-192"></a><a name="index-resizing-minibuffer-193"></a>  When the minibuffer is active, the echo area is treated much like an
ordinary Emacs window.  For instance, you can switch to another window
(with <kbd>C-x o</kbd>), edit text there, then return to the minibuffer
window to finish the argument.  You can even kill text in another
window, return to the minibuffer window, and yank the text into the
argument.  There are some restrictions on the minibuffer window,
however: for instance, you cannot split it.  See <a href="#Windows">Windows</a>.

   <p><a name="index-resize_002dmini_002dwindows-194"></a>  Normally, the minibuffer window occupies a single screen line. 
However, if you add two or more lines' worth of text into the
minibuffer, it expands automatically to accommodate the text.  The
variable <code>resize-mini-windows</code> controls the resizing of the
minibuffer.  The default value is <code>grow-only</code>, which means the
behavior we have just described.  If the value is <code>t</code>, the
minibuffer window will also shrink automatically if you remove some
lines of text from the minibuffer, down to a minimum of one screen
line.  If the value is <code>nil</code>, the minibuffer window never changes
size automatically, but you can use the usual window-resizing commands
on it (see <a href="#Windows">Windows</a>).

   <p><a name="index-max_002dmini_002dwindow_002dheight-195"></a>  The variable <code>max-mini-window-height</code> controls the maximum
height for resizing the minibuffer window.  A floating-point number
specifies a fraction of the frame's height; an integer specifies the
maximum number of lines; <code>nil</code> means do not resize the minibuffer
window automatically.  The default value is 0.25.

   <p>The <kbd>C-M-v</kbd> command in the minibuffer scrolls the help text from
commands that display help text of any sort in another window.  You
can also scroll the help text with <kbd>M-&lt;prior&gt;</kbd> and
<kbd>M-&lt;next&gt;</kbd> (or, equivalently, <kbd>M-&lt;PageUp&gt;</kbd> and
<kbd>M-&lt;PageDown&gt;</kbd>).  This is especially useful with long lists of
possible completions.  See <a href="#Other-Window">Other Window</a>.

   <p><a name="index-enable_002drecursive_002dminibuffers-196"></a>  Emacs normally disallows most commands that use the minibuffer while
the minibuffer is active.  To allow such commands in the minibuffer,
set the variable <code>enable-recursive-minibuffers</code> to <code>t</code>.

   <p><a name="index-minibuffer_002dinactive_002dmode-197"></a>  When not active, the minibuffer is in <code>minibuffer-inactive-mode</code>,
and clicking <kbd>mouse-1</kbd> there shows the <samp><span class="file">*Messages*</span></samp> buffer. 
If you use a dedicated frame for minibuffers, Emacs also recognizes
certain keys there, for example <kbd>n</kbd> to make a new frame.

<p><a name="index-completion-198"></a>
  You can often use a feature called <dfn>completion</dfn> to help enter
arguments.  This means that after you type part of the argument, Emacs
can fill in the rest, or some of it, based on what was typed so far.

   <p><a name="index-completion-alternative-199"></a>  When completion is available, certain keys (usually &lt;TAB&gt;,
&lt;RET&gt;, and &lt;SPC&gt;) are rebound in the minibuffer to special
completion commands (see <a href="#Completion-Commands">Completion Commands</a>).  These commands
attempt to complete the text in the minibuffer, based on a set of
<dfn>completion alternatives</dfn> provided by the command that requested
the argument.  You can usually type <kbd>?</kbd> to see a list of
completion alternatives.

   <p>Although completion is usually done in the minibuffer, the feature
is sometimes available in ordinary buffers too.  See <a href="#Symbol-Completion">Symbol Completion</a>.

<h4 class="subsection">8.4.1 Completion Example</h4>

<p><a name="index-TAB-_0040r_007b_0028completion_0029_007d-200"></a>  A simple example may help here.  <kbd>M-x</kbd> uses the minibuffer to
read the name of a command, so completion works by matching the
minibuffer text against the names of existing Emacs commands.  Suppose
you wish to run the command <code>auto-fill-mode</code>.  You can do that by
typing <kbd>M-x auto-fill-mode &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>, but it is easier to use
completion.

   <p>If you type <kbd>M-x a u &lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>, the &lt;TAB&gt; looks for
completion alternatives (in this case, command names) that start with
`<samp><span class="samp">au</span></samp>'.  There are several, including <code>auto-fill-mode</code> and
<code>autoconf-mode</code>, but they all begin with <code>auto</code>, so the
`<samp><span class="samp">au</span></samp>' in the minibuffer completes to `<samp><span class="samp">auto</span></samp>'.  (More commands
may be defined in your Emacs session.  For example, if a command
called <code>authorize-me</code> was defined, Emacs could only complete
as far as `<samp><span class="samp">aut</span></samp>'.)

   <p>If you type &lt;TAB&gt; again immediately, it cannot determine the
next character; it could be `<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>', or `<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>'.  So it
does not add any characters; instead, &lt;TAB&gt; displays a list of all
possible completions in another window.

   <p>Next, type <kbd>-f</kbd>.  The minibuffer now contains `<samp><span class="samp">auto-f</span></samp>', and
the only command name that starts with this is <code>auto-fill-mode</code>. 
If you now type &lt;TAB&gt;, completion fills in the rest of the
argument `<samp><span class="samp">auto-fill-mode</span></samp>' into the minibuffer.

   <p>Hence, typing just <kbd>a u &lt;TAB&gt; - f &lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> allows you to
enter `<samp><span class="samp">auto-fill-mode</span></samp>'.

<h4 class="subsection">8.4.2 Completion Commands</h4>

<p>Here is a list of the completion commands defined in the minibuffer
when completion is allowed.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-minibuffer_002dcomplete-201"></a>Complete the text in the minibuffer as much as possible; if unable to
complete, display a list of possible completions
(<code>minibuffer-complete</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd><dd>Complete up to one word from the minibuffer text before point
(<code>minibuffer-complete-word</code>).  This command is not available for
arguments that often include spaces, such as file names. 
<br><dt><kbd>&lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Submit the text in the minibuffer as the argument, possibly completing
first (<code>minibuffer-complete-and-exit</code>).  See <a href="#Completion-Exit">Completion Exit</a>. 
<br><dt><kbd>?</kbd><dd>Display a list of completions (<code>minibuffer-completion-help</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-TAB-_0040r_007b_0028completion_0029_007d-202"></a><a name="index-minibuffer_002dcomplete-203"></a>  &lt;TAB&gt; (<code>minibuffer-complete</code>) is the most fundamental
completion command.  It searches for all possible completions that
match the existing minibuffer text, and attempts to complete as much
as it can.  See <a href="#Completion-Styles">Completion Styles</a>, for how completion alternatives
are chosen.

   <p><a name="index-SPC-_0040r_007b_0028completion_0029_007d-204"></a><a name="index-minibuffer_002dcomplete_002dword-205"></a>  &lt;SPC&gt; (<code>minibuffer-complete-word</code>) completes like
&lt;TAB&gt;, but only up to the next hyphen or space.  If you have
`<samp><span class="samp">auto-f</span></samp>' in the minibuffer and type &lt;SPC&gt;, it finds that the
completion is `<samp><span class="samp">auto-fill-mode</span></samp>', but it only inserts `<samp><span class="samp">ill-</span></samp>',
giving `<samp><span class="samp">auto-fill-</span></samp>'.  Another &lt;SPC&gt; at this point completes
all the way to `<samp><span class="samp">auto-fill-mode</span></samp>'.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_003f-_0040r_007b_0028completion_0029_007d-206"></a><a name="index-completion-list-207"></a>  If &lt;TAB&gt; or &lt;SPC&gt; is unable to complete, it displays a list
of matching completion alternatives (if there are any) in another
window.  You can display the same list with <kbd>?</kbd>
(<code>minibuffer-completion-help</code>).  The following commands can be
used with the completion list:

     
<a name="index-mouse_002dchoose_002dcompletion-208"></a>
<dl><dt><kbd>mouse-1</kbd><dt><kbd>mouse-2</kbd><dd>Clicking mouse button 1 or 2 on a completion alternative chooses it

the completion list (<code>switch-to-completions</code>).  This paves the
way for using the commands below.  &lt;PageUp&gt; or &lt;prior&gt; does
the same.  You can also select the window in other ways
(see <a href="#Windows">Windows</a>).

     <p><a name="index-choose_002dcompletion-210"></a><br><dt><kbd>&lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>While in the completion list buffer, this chooses the completion at

completion alternative (<code>next-completion</code>).

     <p><a name="index-previous_002dcompletion-212"></a><br><dt><kbd>&lt;LEFT&gt;</kbd><dd>While in the completion list buffer, this moves point to the previous
completion alternative (<code>previous-completion</code>).

<h4 class="subsection">8.4.3 Completion Exit</h4>

<p><a name="index-RET-_0040r_007b_0028completion-in-minibuffer_0029_007d-213"></a><a name="index-minibuffer_002dcomplete_002dand_002dexit-214"></a>  When a command reads an argument using the minibuffer with
completion, it also controls what happens when you type &lt;RET&gt;
(<code>minibuffer-complete-and-exit</code>) to submit the argument.  There
are four types of behavior:

     <ul>
<li><dfn>Strict completion</dfn> accepts only exact completion matches.  Typing
&lt;RET&gt; exits the minibuffer only if the minibuffer text is an exact
match, or completes to one.  Otherwise, Emacs refuses to exit the
minibuffer; instead it tries to complete, and if no completion can be
done it momentarily displays `<samp><span class="samp">[No match]</span></samp>' after the minibuffer
text.  (You can still leave the minibuffer by typing <kbd>C-g</kbd> to
cancel the command.)

     <p>An example of a command that uses this behavior is <kbd>M-x</kbd>, since it
is meaningless for it to accept a non-existent command name.

     <li><dfn>Cautious completion</dfn> is like strict completion, except &lt;RET&gt;
exits only if the text is already an exact match.  If the text
completes to an exact match, &lt;RET&gt; performs that completion but
does not exit yet; you must type a second &lt;RET&gt; to exit.

     <p>Cautious completion is used for reading file names for files that must
already exist, for example.

     <li><dfn>Permissive completion</dfn> allows any input; the completion
candidates are just suggestions.  Typing &lt;RET&gt; does not complete,
it just submits the argument as you have entered it.

     <p><a name="index-minibuffer-confirmation-215"></a><a name="index-confirming-in-the-minibuffer-216"></a><li><dfn>Permissive completion with confirmation</dfn> is like permissive
completion, with an exception: if you typed &lt;TAB&gt; and this
completed the text up to some intermediate state (i.e., one that is not
yet an exact completion match), typing &lt;RET&gt; right afterward does
not submit the argument.  Instead, Emacs asks for confirmation by
momentarily displaying `<samp><span class="samp">[Confirm]</span></samp>' after the text; type &lt;RET&gt;
again to confirm and submit the text.  This catches a common mistake,
in which one types &lt;RET&gt; before realizing that &lt;TAB&gt; did not
complete as far as desired.

     <p><a name="index-confirm_002dnonexistent_002dfile_002dor_002dbuffer-217"></a>You can tweak the confirmation behavior by customizing the variable
<code>confirm-nonexistent-file-or-buffer</code>.  The default value,
<code>after-completion</code>, gives the behavior we have just described. 
If you change it to <code>nil</code>, Emacs does not ask for confirmation,
falling back on permissive completion.  If you change it to any other
non-<code>nil</code> value, Emacs asks for confirmation whether or not the
preceding command was &lt;TAB&gt;.

     <p>This behavior is used by most commands that read file names, like
<kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>, and commands that read buffer names, like <kbd>C-x b</kbd>. 
</ul>

<h4 class="subsection">8.4.4 How Completion Alternatives Are Chosen</h4>

<p><a name="index-completion-style-218"></a>
  Completion commands work by narrowing a large list of possible
completion alternatives to a smaller subset that matches what you
have typed in the minibuffer.  In <a href="#Completion-Example">Completion Example</a>, we gave a
simple example of such matching.  The procedure of determining what
constitutes a match is quite intricate.  Emacs attempts to offer
plausible completions under most circumstances.

   <p>Emacs performs completion using one or more <dfn>completion
styles</dfn>&mdash;sets of criteria for matching minibuffer text to completion
alternatives.  During completion, Emacs tries each completion style in
turn.  If a style yields one or more matches, that is used as the list
of completion alternatives.  If a style produces no matches, Emacs
falls back on the next style.

   <p><a name="index-completion_002dstyles-219"></a>  The list variable <code>completion-styles</code> specifies the completion
styles to use.  Each list element is the name of a completion style (a
Lisp symbol).  The default completion styles are (in order):

     <dl>
<dt><code>basic</code><dd>A matching completion alternative must have the same beginning as the
text in the minibuffer before point.  Furthermore, if there is any
text in the minibuffer after point, the rest of the completion
alternative must contain that text as a substring.

     <p><a name="index-partial-completion-220"></a><br><dt><code>partial-completion</code><dd>This aggressive completion style divides the minibuffer text into
words separated by hyphens or spaces, and completes each word
separately.  (For example, when completing command names,
`<samp><span class="samp">em-l-m</span></samp>' completes to `<samp><span class="samp">emacs-lisp-mode</span></samp>'.)

     <p>Furthermore, a `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' in the minibuffer text is treated as a
<dfn>wildcard</dfn>&mdash;it matches any character at the corresponding
position in the completion alternative.

     <br><dt><code>emacs22</code><dd>This completion style is similar to <code>basic</code>, except that it
ignores the text in the minibuffer after point.  It is so-named
because it corresponds to the completion behavior in Emacs 22. 
</dl>

<p class="noindent">The following additional completion styles are also defined, and you
can add them to <code>completion-styles</code> if you wish
(see <a href="#Customization">Customization</a>):

     <dl>
<dt><code>substring</code><dd>A matching completion alternative must contain the text in the
minibuffer before point, and the text in the minibuffer after point,
as substrings (in that same order).

     <p>Thus, if the text in the minibuffer is `<samp><span class="samp">foobar</span></samp>', with point
between `<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">bar</span></samp>', that matches
`<samp><var>a</var><span class="samp">foo</span><var>b</var><span class="samp">bar</span><var>c</var></samp>', where <var>a</var>, <var>b</var>, and
<var>c</var> can be any string including the empty string.

     <br><dt><code>initials</code><dd>This very aggressive completion style attempts to complete acronyms
and initialisms.  For example, when completing command names, it
matches `<samp><span class="samp">lch</span></samp>' to `<samp><span class="samp">list-command-history</span></samp>'. 
</dl>

<p class="noindent">There is also a very simple completion style called <code>emacs21</code>. 
In this style, if the text in the minibuffer is `<samp><span class="samp">foobar</span></samp>',
only matches starting with `<samp><span class="samp">foobar</span></samp>' are considered.

   <p><a name="index-completion_002dcategory_002doverrides-221"></a>You can use different completion styles in different situations,
by setting the variable <code>completion-category-overrides</code>. 
For example, the default setting says to use only <code>basic</code>
and <code>substring</code> completion for buffer names.

<h4 class="subsection">8.4.5 Completion Options</h4>

<p><a name="index-case_002dsensitivity-and-completion-222"></a><a name="index-case-in-completion-223"></a>  Case is significant when completing case-sensitive arguments, such
as command names.  For example, when completing command names,
`<samp><span class="samp">AU</span></samp>' does not complete to `<samp><span class="samp">auto-fill-mode</span></samp>'.  Case
differences are ignored when completing arguments in which case does
not matter.

   <p><a name="index-read_002dfile_002dname_002dcompletion_002dignore_002dcase-224"></a><a name="index-read_002dbuffer_002dcompletion_002dignore_002dcase-225"></a>  When completing file names, case differences are ignored if the
variable <code>read-file-name-completion-ignore-case</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>.  The default value is <code>nil</code> on systems that have
case-sensitive file-names, such as GNU/Linux; it is non-<code>nil</code> on
systems that have case-insensitive file-names, such as Microsoft
Windows.  When completing buffer names, case differences are ignored
if the variable <code>read-buffer-completion-ignore-case</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>; the default is <code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-completion_002dignored_002dextensions-226"></a><a name="index-ignored-file-names_002c-in-completion-227"></a>  When completing file names, Emacs usually omits certain alternatives
that are considered unlikely to be chosen, as determined by the list
variable <code>completion-ignored-extensions</code>.  Each element in the
list should be a string; any file name ending in such a string is
ignored as a completion alternative.  Any element ending in a slash
(<samp><span class="file">/</span></samp>) represents a subdirectory name.  The standard value of
<code>completion-ignored-extensions</code> has several elements including
<code>".o"</code>, <code>".elc"</code>, and <code>"~"</code>.  For example, if a
directory contains `<samp><span class="samp">foo.c</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">foo.elc</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>'
completes to `<samp><span class="samp">foo.c</span></samp>'.  However, if <em>all</em> possible
completions end in otherwise-ignored strings, they are not ignored: in the
previous example, `<samp><span class="samp">foo.e</span></samp>' completes to `<samp><span class="samp">foo.elc</span></samp>'.  Emacs
disregards <code>completion-ignored-extensions</code> when showing
completion alternatives in the completion list.

   <p>Shell completion is an extended version of filename completion,
see <a href="#Shell-Options">Shell Options</a>.

   <p><a name="index-completion_002dauto_002dhelp-228"></a>  If <code>completion-auto-help</code> is set to <code>nil</code>, the completion
commands never display the completion list buffer; you must type
<kbd>?</kbd>  to display the list.  If the value is <code>lazy</code>, Emacs only
shows the completion list buffer on the second attempt to complete. 
In other words, if there is nothing to complete, the first &lt;TAB&gt;
echoes `<samp><span class="samp">Next char not unique</span></samp>'; the second &lt;TAB&gt; shows the
completion list buffer.

   <p><a name="index-completion_002dcycle_002dthreshold-229"></a>  If <code>completion-cycle-threshold</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, completion
commands can cycle through completion alternatives.  Normally, if
there is more than one completion alternative for the text in the
minibuffer, a completion command completes up to the longest common
substring.  If you change <code>completion-cycle-threshold</code> to
<code>t</code>, the completion command instead completes to the first of
those completion alternatives; each subsequent invocation of the
completion command replaces that with the next completion alternative,
in a cyclic manner.  If you give <code>completion-cycle-threshold</code> a
numeric value <var>n</var>, completion commands switch to this cycling
behavior only when there are <var>n</var> or fewer alternatives.

<h3 class="section">8.5 Minibuffer History</h3>

<p><a name="index-minibuffer-history-230"></a><a name="index-history-of-minibuffer-input-231"></a>
  Every argument that you enter with the minibuffer is saved in a
<dfn>minibuffer history list</dfn> so you can easily use it again later. 
You can use the following arguments to quickly fetch an earlier
argument into the minibuffer:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-p</kbd><dd>Move to the previous item in the minibuffer history, an earlier
argument (<code>previous-history-element</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-n</kbd><dd>Move to the next item in the minibuffer history
(<code>next-history-element</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>&lt;UP&gt;</kbd><dt><kbd>&lt;DOWN&gt;</kbd><dd>Like <kbd>M-p</kbd> and <kbd>M-n</kbd>, but move to the previous or next line of
a multi-line item before going to the previous history item
(<code>previous-line-or-history-element</code> and
<code>next-line-or-history-element</code>) . 
<br><dt><kbd>M-r </kbd><var>regexp</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Move to an earlier item in the minibuffer history that
matches <var>regexp</var> (<code>previous-matching-history-element</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-s </kbd><var>regexp</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Move to a later item in the minibuffer history that matches
<var>regexp</var> (<code>next-matching-history-element</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-M_002dp-_0040r_007b_0028minibuffer-history_0029_007d-232"></a><a name="index-M_002dn-_0040r_007b_0028minibuffer-history_0029_007d-233"></a><a name="index-UP-_0040r_007b_0028minibuffer-history_0029_007d-234"></a><a name="index-DOWN-_0040r_007b_0028minibuffer-history_0029_007d-235"></a><a name="index-next_002dhistory_002delement-236"></a><a name="index-previous_002dhistory_002delement-237"></a>  While in the minibuffer, <kbd>M-p</kbd> (<code>previous-history-element</code>)
moves through the minibuffer history list, one item at a time.  Each
<kbd>M-p</kbd> fetches an earlier item from the history list into the
minibuffer, replacing its existing contents.  Typing <kbd>M-n</kbd>
(<code>next-history-element</code>) moves through the minibuffer history
list in the opposite direction, fetching later entries into the
minibuffer.

   <p>If you type <kbd>M-n</kbd> in the minibuffer when there are no later
entries in the minibuffer history (e.g., if you haven't previously
typed <kbd>M-p</kbd>), Emacs tries fetching from a list of default
arguments: values that you are likely to enter.  You can think of this
as moving through the &ldquo;future history&rdquo;.

   <p><a name="index-previous_002dline_002dor_002dhistory_002delement-238"></a><a name="index-next_002dline_002dor_002dhistory_002delement-239"></a>  The arrow keys <kbd>&lt;UP&gt;</kbd> and <kbd>&lt;DOWN&gt;</kbd> work like
<kbd>M-p</kbd> and <kbd>M-n</kbd>, but if the current history item is longer
than a single line, they allow you to move to the previous or next
line of the current history item before going to the previous or next
history item.

   <p>If you edit the text inserted by the <kbd>M-p</kbd> or <kbd>M-n</kbd>
minibuffer history commands, this does not change its entry in the
history list.  However, the edited argument does go at the end of the
history list when you submit it.

   <p><a name="index-previous_002dmatching_002dhistory_002delement-240"></a><a name="index-next_002dmatching_002dhistory_002delement-241"></a><a name="index-M_002dr-_0040r_007b_0028minibuffer-history_0029_007d-242"></a><a name="index-M_002ds-_0040r_007b_0028minibuffer-history_0029_007d-243"></a>  You can use <kbd>M-r</kbd> (<code>previous-matching-history-element</code>) to
search through older elements in the history list, and <kbd>M-s</kbd>
(<code>next-matching-history-element</code>) to search through newer
entries.  Each of these commands asks for a <dfn>regular expression</dfn>
as an argument, and fetches the first matching entry into the
minibuffer.  See <a href="#Regexps">Regexps</a>, for an explanation of regular
expressions.  A numeric prefix argument <var>n</var> means to fetch the
<var>n</var>th matching entry.  These commands are unusual, in that they
use the minibuffer to read the regular expression argument, even
though they are invoked from the minibuffer.  An upper-case letter in
the regular expression makes the search case-sensitive (see <a href="#Lax-Search">Lax Search</a>).

   <p>You can also search through the history using an incremental search. 
See <a href="#Isearch-Minibuffer">Isearch Minibuffer</a>.

   <p>Emacs keeps separate history lists for several different kinds of
arguments.  For example, there is a list for file names, used by all
the commands that read file names.  Other history lists include buffer
names, command names (used by <kbd>M-x</kbd>), and command arguments (used
by commands like <code>query-replace</code>).

   <p><a name="index-history_002dlength-244"></a>  The variable <code>history-length</code> specifies the maximum length of a
minibuffer history list; adding a new element deletes the oldest
element if the list gets too long.  If the value is <code>t</code>, there is
no maximum length.

   <p><a name="index-history_002ddelete_002dduplicates-245"></a>  The variable <code>history-delete-duplicates</code> specifies whether to
delete duplicates in history.  If it is non-<code>nil</code>, adding a new
element deletes from the list all other elements that are equal to it. 
The default is <code>nil</code>.

<h3 class="section">8.6 Repeating Minibuffer Commands</h3>

<p><a name="index-command-history-246"></a><a name="index-history-of-commands-247"></a>
  Every command that uses the minibuffer once is recorded on a special
history list, the <dfn>command history</dfn>, together with the values of
its arguments, so that you can repeat the entire command.  In
particular, every use of <kbd>M-x</kbd> is recorded there, since <kbd>M-x</kbd>
uses the minibuffer to read the command name.

   <p><a name="index-list_002dcommand_002dhistory-248"></a>
     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x &lt;ESC&gt; &lt;ESC&gt;</kbd><dd>Re-execute a recent minibuffer command from the command history
 (<code>repeat-complex-command</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x list-command-history</kbd><dd>Display the entire command history, showing all the commands
<kbd>C-x &lt;ESC&gt; &lt;ESC&gt;</kbd> can repeat, most recent first. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-ESC-ESC-249"></a><a name="index-repeat_002dcomplex_002dcommand-250"></a>  <kbd>C-x &lt;ESC&gt; &lt;ESC&gt;</kbd> re-executes a recent command that used
the minibuffer.  With no argument, it repeats the last such command. 
A numeric argument specifies which command to repeat; 1 means the last
one, 2 the previous, and so on.

   <p><kbd>C-x &lt;ESC&gt; &lt;ESC&gt;</kbd> works by turning the previous command
into a Lisp expression and then entering a minibuffer initialized with
the text for that expression.  Even if you don't know Lisp, it will
probably be obvious which command is displayed for repetition.  If you
type just &lt;RET&gt;, that repeats the command unchanged.  You can also
change the command by editing the Lisp expression before you execute
it.  The executed command is added to the front of the command history
unless it is identical to the most recent item.

   <p>Once inside the minibuffer for <kbd>C-x &lt;ESC&gt; &lt;ESC&gt;</kbd>, you
can use the usual minibuffer history commands (see <a href="#Minibuffer-History">Minibuffer History</a>) to move through the history list.  After finding the desired
previous command, you can edit its expression as usual and then execute
it by typing &lt;RET&gt;.

   <p><a name="index-isearch_002dresume_002din_002dcommand_002dhistory-251"></a>  Incremental search does not, strictly speaking, use the minibuffer. 
Therefore, although it behaves like a complex command, it normally
does not appear in the history list for <kbd>C-x &lt;ESC&gt; &lt;ESC&gt;</kbd>. 
You can make incremental search commands appear in the history by
setting <code>isearch-resume-in-command-history</code> to a non-<code>nil</code>
value.  See <a href="#Incremental-Search">Incremental Search</a>.

   <p><a name="index-command_002dhistory-252"></a>  The list of previous minibuffer-using commands is stored as a Lisp
list in the variable <code>command-history</code>.  Each element is a Lisp
expression that describes one command and its arguments.  Lisp programs
can re-execute a command by calling <code>eval</code> with the
<code>command-history</code> element.

<h3 class="section">8.7 Entering passwords</h3>

<p>Sometimes, you may need to enter a password into Emacs.  For instance,
when you tell Emacs to visit a file on another machine via a network
protocol such as FTP, you often need to supply a password to gain
access to the machine (see <a href="#Remote-Files">Remote Files</a>).

   <p>Entering a password is similar to using a minibuffer.  Emacs
displays a prompt in the echo area (such as `<samp><span class="samp">Password: </span></samp>'); after
you type the required password, press &lt;RET&gt; to submit it.  To
prevent others from seeing your password, every character you type is
displayed as a dot (`<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>') instead of its usual form.

   <p>Most of the features and commands associated with the minibuffer can
<em>not</em> be used when entering a password.  There is no history or
completion, and you cannot change windows or perform any other action
with Emacs until you have submitted the password.

   <p>While you are typing the password, you may press &lt;DEL&gt; to delete
backwards, removing the last character entered.  <kbd>C-u</kbd> deletes
everything you have typed so far.  <kbd>C-g</kbd> quits the password prompt
(see <a href="#Quitting">Quitting</a>).  <kbd>C-y</kbd> inserts the current kill into the
password (see <a href="#Killing">Killing</a>).  You may type either &lt;RET&gt; or
&lt;ESC&gt; to submit the password.  Any other self-inserting character
key inserts the associated character into the password, and all other
input is ignored.

<h3 class="section">8.8 Yes or No Prompts</h3>

<p>An Emacs command may require you to answer a yes-or-no question
during the course of its execution.  Such queries come in two main
varieties.

   <p><a name="index-y-or-n-prompt-253"></a>  For the first type of yes-or-no query, the prompt ends with
`<samp><span class="samp">(y or n)</span></samp>'.  Such a query does not actually use the minibuffer;
the prompt appears in the echo area, and you answer by typing either
`<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>', which immediately delivers the response.  For
example, if you type <kbd>C-x C-w</kbd> (<kbd>write-file</kbd>) to save a
buffer, and enter the name of an existing file, Emacs issues a prompt
like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     File ‘foo.el’ exists; overwrite? (y or n)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Because this query does not actually use the minibuffer, the usual
minibuffer editing commands cannot be used.  However, you can perform
some window scrolling operations while the query is active: <kbd>C-l</kbd>
recenters the selected window; <kbd>M-v</kbd> (or &lt;PageDown&gt; or
&lt;next&gt;) scrolls forward; <kbd>C-v</kbd> (or &lt;PageUp&gt;, or
&lt;prior&gt;) scrolls backward; <kbd>C-M-v</kbd> scrolls forward in the next
window; and <kbd>C-M-S-v</kbd> scrolls backward in the next window.  Typing
<kbd>C-g</kbd> dismisses the query, and quits the command that issued it
(see <a href="#Quitting">Quitting</a>).

   <p><a name="index-yes-or-no-prompt-254"></a>  The second type of yes-or-no query is typically employed if
giving the wrong answer would have serious consequences; it uses the
minibuffer, and features a prompt ending with `<samp><span class="samp">(yes or no)</span></samp>'.  For
example, if you invoke <kbd>C-x k</kbd> (<code>kill-buffer</code>) on a
file-visiting buffer with unsaved changes, Emacs activates the
minibuffer with a prompt like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     Buffer foo.el modified; kill anyway? (yes or no)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">To answer, you must type `<samp><span class="samp">yes</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">no</span></samp>' into the minibuffer,
followed by &lt;RET&gt;.  The minibuffer behaves as described in the
previous sections; you can switch to another window with <kbd>C-x o</kbd>,
use the history commands <kbd>M-p</kbd> and <kbd>M-f</kbd>, etc.  Type <kbd>C-g</kbd>
to quit the minibuffer and the querying command.

<h2 class="chapter">9 Running Commands by Name</h2>

<p>Every Emacs command has a name that you can use to run it.  For
convenience, many commands also have key bindings.  You can run those
commands by typing the keys, or run them by name.  Most Emacs commands
have no key bindings, so the only way to run them is by name. 
(See <a href="#Key-Bindings">Key Bindings</a>, for how to set up key bindings.)

   <p>By convention, a command name consists of one or more words,
separated by hyphens; for example, <code>auto-fill-mode</code> or
<code>manual-entry</code>.  Command names mostly use complete English words
to make them easier to remember.

   <p><a name="index-M_002dx-255"></a>  To run a command by name, start with <kbd>M-x</kbd>, type the command
name, then terminate it with &lt;RET&gt;.  <kbd>M-x</kbd> uses the minibuffer
to read the command name.  The string `<samp><span class="samp">M-x</span></samp>' appears at the
beginning of the minibuffer as a <dfn>prompt</dfn> to remind you to enter a
command name to be run.  &lt;RET&gt; exits the minibuffer and runs the
command.  See <a href="#Minibuffer">Minibuffer</a>, for more information on the minibuffer.

   <p>You can use completion to enter the command name.  For example,
to invoke the command <code>forward-char</code>, you can type

<pre class="example">     M-x forward-char &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">or

<pre class="example">     M-x forw &lt;TAB&gt; c &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Note that <code>forward-char</code> is the same command that you invoke with
the key <kbd>C-f</kbd>.  The existence of a key binding does not stop you
from running the command by name.

   <p><a name="index-obsolete-command-256"></a>  When <kbd>M-x</kbd> completes on commands, it ignores the commands that
are declared <dfn>obsolete</dfn>; for these, you will have to type their
full name.  Obsolete commands are those for which newer, better
alternatives exist, and which are slated for removal in some future
Emacs release.

   <p>To cancel the <kbd>M-x</kbd> and not run a command, type <kbd>C-g</kbd> instead
of entering the command name.  This takes you back to command level.

   <p>To pass a numeric argument to the command you are invoking with
<kbd>M-x</kbd>, specify the numeric argument before <kbd>M-x</kbd>.  The
argument value appears in the prompt while the command name is being
read, and finally <kbd>M-x</kbd> passes the argument to that command.

   <p><a name="index-suggest_002dkey_002dbindings-257"></a>  When the command you run with <kbd>M-x</kbd> has a key binding, Emacs
mentions this in the echo area after running the command.  For
example, if you type <kbd>M-x forward-word</kbd>, the message says that you
can run the same command by typing <kbd>M-f</kbd>.  You can turn off these
messages by setting the variable <code>suggest-key-bindings</code> to
<code>nil</code>.  The value of <code>suggest-key-bindings</code> can also be a
number, in which case Emacs will show the binding for that many
seconds before removing it from display.  The default behavior is to
display the binding for 2 seconds.

   <p>Commands that don't have key bindings, can still be invoked after
typing less than their full name at the `<samp><span class="samp">M-x</span></samp>' prompt.  Emacs
mentions such shorthands in the echo area if they are significantly
shorter than the full command name.  The setting of
<code>suggest-key-bindings</code> affects these hints as well.

   <p>In this manual, when we speak of running a command by name, we often
omit the &lt;RET&gt; that terminates the name.  Thus we might say
<kbd>M-x auto-fill-mode</kbd> rather than <kbd>M-x auto-fill-mode
&lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.  We mention the &lt;RET&gt; only for emphasis, such as when
the command is followed by arguments.

   <p><a name="index-execute_002dextended_002dcommand-258"></a>  <kbd>M-x</kbd> works by running the command
<code>execute-extended-command</code>, which is responsible for reading the

<p><a name="index-Help-259"></a><a name="index-help-260"></a><a name="index-self_002ddocumentation-261"></a><a name="index-help_002dcommand-262"></a><a name="index-C_002dh-263"></a><a name="index-F1-264"></a>
<a name="index-C_002dh-C_002dh-265"></a><a name="index-help_002dfor_002dhelp-266"></a>  Emacs provides a wide variety of help commands, all accessible
through the prefix key <kbd>C-h</kbd> (or, equivalently, the function key
&lt;F1&gt;).  These help commands are described in the following
sections.  You can also type <kbd>C-h C-h</kbd> to view a list of help
commands (<code>help-for-help</code>).  You can scroll the list with
&lt;SPC&gt; and &lt;DEL&gt;, then type the help command you want.  To
cancel, type <kbd>C-g</kbd>.

   <p>Many help commands display their information in a special <dfn>help
buffer</dfn>.  In this buffer, you can type &lt;SPC&gt; and &lt;DEL&gt; to
scroll and type &lt;RET&gt; to follow hyperlinks.  See <a href="#Help-Mode">Help Mode</a>.

   <p><a name="index-searching-documentation-efficiently-267"></a><a name="index-looking-for-a-subject-in-documentation-268"></a>  If you are looking for a certain feature, but don't know what it is
called or where to look, we recommend three methods.  First, try an
apropos command, then try searching the manual index, then look in the
FAQ and the package keywords.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-h a </kbd><var>topics</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>This searches for commands whose names match the argument
<var>topics</var>.  The argument can be a keyword, a list of keywords, or a
regular expression (see <a href="#Regexps">Regexps</a>).  See <a href="#Apropos">Apropos</a>.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-h i d m emacs &lt;RET&gt; i </kbd><var>topic</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>This searches for <var>topic</var> in the indices of the Emacs Info manual,
displaying the first match found.  Press <kbd>,</kbd> to see subsequent
matches.  You can use a regular expression as <var>topic</var>.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-h i d m emacs &lt;RET&gt; s </kbd><var>topic</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Similar, but searches the <em>text</em> of the manual rather than the
indices.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-h C-f</kbd><dd>This displays the Emacs FAQ, using Info.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-h p</kbd><dd>This displays the available Emacs packages based on keywords. 
See <a href="#Package-Keywords">Package Keywords</a>. 
</dl>

   <p><kbd>C-h</kbd> or &lt;F1&gt; mean &ldquo;help&rdquo; in various other contexts as
well.  For instance, you can type them after a prefix key to view a
list of the keys that can follow the prefix key.  (You can also use
<kbd>?</kbd> in this context.  A few prefix keys don't support <kbd>C-h</kbd>
or <kbd>?</kbd> in this way, because they define other meanings for those
inputs, but they all support &lt;F1&gt;.)

<h3 class="section">10.2 Documentation for a Key</h3>

<p><a name="index-describe_002dkey_002dbriefly-269"></a><a name="index-describe_002dkey-270"></a>  The help commands to get information about a key sequence are
<kbd>C-h c</kbd> (<code>describe-key-briefly</code>) and <kbd>C-h k</kbd>
(<code>describe-key</code>).

   <p><a name="index-C_002dh-c-271"></a>  <kbd>C-h c </kbd><var>key</var> displays in the echo area the name of the
command that <var>key</var> is bound to.  For example, <kbd>C-h c C-f</kbd>
displays `<samp><span class="samp">forward-char</span></samp>'.

   <p><a name="index-documentation-string-272"></a><a name="index-C_002dh-k-273"></a>  <kbd>C-h k </kbd><var>key</var> is similar but gives more information: it
displays a help buffer containing the command's <dfn>documentation
string</dfn>, which describes exactly what the command does.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dh-K-274"></a><a name="index-Info_002dgoto_002demacs_002dkey_002dcommand_002dnode-275"></a>  <kbd>C-h K </kbd><var>key</var> displays the section of the Emacs manual that
describes the command corresponding to <var>key</var>.

   <p><kbd>C-h c</kbd>, <kbd>C-h k</kbd> and <kbd>C-h K</kbd> work for any sort of key
sequences, including function keys, menus, and mouse events.  For
instance, after <kbd>C-h k</kbd> you can select a menu item from the menu
bar, to view the documentation string of the command it runs.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dh-w-276"></a><a name="index-where_002dis-277"></a>  <kbd>C-h w </kbd><var>command</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> lists the keys that are bound to
<var>command</var>.  It displays the list in the echo area.  If it says the
command is not on any key, that means you must use <kbd>M-x</kbd> to run
it.  <kbd>C-h w</kbd> runs the command <code>where-is</code>.

<h3 class="section">10.3 Help by Command or Variable Name</h3>

<p><a name="index-C_002dh-f-278"></a><a name="index-describe_002dfunction-279"></a>  <kbd>C-h f </kbd><var>function</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> (<code>describe-function</code>)
displays the documentation of Lisp function <var>function</var>, in a
window.  Since commands are Lisp functions, you can use this method to
view the documentation of any command whose name you know.  For
example,

<pre class="example">     C-h f auto-fill-mode &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">displays the documentation of <code>auto-fill-mode</code>.  This is the only
way to get the documentation of a command that is not bound to any key
(one which you would normally run using <kbd>M-x</kbd>).

   <p><kbd>C-h f</kbd> is also useful for Lisp functions that you use in a Lisp
program.  For example, if you have just written the expression
<code>(make-vector len)</code> and want to check that you are using
<code>make-vector</code> properly, type <kbd>C-h f make-vector &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>. 
Because <kbd>C-h f</kbd> allows all function names, not just command names,
you may find that some of your favorite completion abbreviations that
work in <kbd>M-x</kbd> don't work in <kbd>C-h f</kbd>.  An abbreviation that is
unique among command names may not be unique among all function names.

   <p>If you type <kbd>C-h f &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>, it describes the function called
by the innermost Lisp expression in the buffer around point,
<em>provided</em> that function name is a valid, defined Lisp function. 
(That name appears as the default while you enter the argument.)  For
example, if point is located following the text `<samp><span class="samp">(make-vector
(car x)</span></samp>', the innermost list containing point is the one that starts
with `<samp><span class="samp">(make-vector</span></samp>', so <kbd>C-h f &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> describes the
function <code>make-vector</code>.

   <p><kbd>C-h f</kbd> is also useful just to verify that you spelled a
function name correctly.  If the minibuffer prompt for <kbd>C-h f</kbd>
shows the function name from the buffer as the default, it means that
name is defined as a Lisp function.  Type <kbd>C-g</kbd> to cancel the
<kbd>C-h f</kbd> command if you don't really want to view the
documentation.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dh-v-280"></a><a name="index-describe_002dvariable-281"></a>  <kbd>C-h v</kbd> (<code>describe-variable</code>) is like <kbd>C-h f</kbd> but
describes Lisp variables instead of Lisp functions.  Its default is
the Lisp symbol around or before point, if that is the name of a
defined Lisp variable.  See <a href="#Variables">Variables</a>.

   <p>Help buffers that describe Emacs variables and functions normally
have hyperlinks to the corresponding source code, if you have the
source files installed (see <a href="#Hyperlinking">Hyperlinking</a>).

   <p><a name="index-C_002dh-F-282"></a><a name="index-Info_002dgoto_002demacs_002dcommand_002dnode-283"></a>  To find a command's documentation in a manual, use <kbd>C-h F</kbd>
(<code>Info-goto-emacs-command-node</code>).  This knows about various
manuals, not just the Emacs manual, and finds the right one.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dh-o-284"></a><a name="index-describe_002dsymbol-285"></a>  <kbd>C-h o</kbd> (<code>describe-symbol</code>) is like <kbd>C-h f</kbd> and
<kbd>C-h v</kbd>, but it describes any symbol, be it a function, a
variable, or a face.  If the symbol has more than one definition, like
it has both definition as a function and as a variable, this command
will show the documentation of all of them, one after the other.

<h3 class="section">10.4 Apropos</h3>

<p><a name="index-apropos-286"></a>
  The <dfn>apropos</dfn> commands answer questions like, &ldquo;What are the
commands for working with files?&rdquo;  More precisely, you specify an
<dfn>apropos pattern</dfn>, which means either a word, a list of words, or
a regular expression.

   <p>Each of the following apropos commands reads an apropos pattern in
the minibuffer, searches for items that match the pattern, and
displays the results in a different window.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-h a</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dh-a-287"></a><a name="index-apropos_002dcommand-288"></a>Search for commands (<code>apropos-command</code>).  With a prefix argument,
search for noninteractive functions too.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x apropos</kbd><dd><a name="index-apropos-289"></a>Search for functions and variables.  Both interactive functions
(commands) and noninteractive functions can be found by this.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x apropos-user-option</kbd><dd><a name="index-apropos_002duser_002doption-290"></a>Search for user-customizable variables.  With a prefix argument,
search for non-customizable variables too.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x apropos-variable</kbd><dd><a name="index-apropos_002dvariable-291"></a>Search for variables.  With a prefix argument, search for
customizable variables only.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x apropos-value</kbd><dd><a name="index-apropos_002dvalue-292"></a>Search for variables whose values match the specified pattern.  With a
prefix argument, search also for functions with definitions matching
the pattern, and Lisp symbols with properties matching the pattern.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-h d</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dh-d-293"></a><a name="index-apropos_002ddocumentation-294"></a>Search for functions and variables whose documentation strings match
the specified pattern (<code>apropos-documentation</code>). 
</dl>

   <p>The simplest kind of apropos pattern is one word.  Anything
containing that word matches the pattern.  Thus, to find commands that
work on files, type <kbd>C-h a file &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.  This displays a list
of all command names that contain `<samp><span class="samp">file</span></samp>', including
<code>copy-file</code>, <code>find-file</code>, and so on.  Each command name
comes with a brief description and a list of keys you can currently
invoke it with.  In our example, it would say that you can invoke
<code>find-file</code> by typing <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>.

   <p>For more information about a function definition, variable or symbol
property listed in an apropos buffer, you can click on it with
<kbd>mouse-1</kbd> or <kbd>mouse-2</kbd>, or move there and type &lt;RET&gt;.

   <p>When you specify more than one word in the apropos pattern, a name
must contain at least two of the words in order to match.  Thus, if
you are looking for commands to kill a chunk of text before point, you
could try <kbd>C-h a kill back backward behind before &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.  The
real command name <code>kill-backward</code> will match that; if there were
a command <code>kill-text-before</code>, it would also match, since it
contains two of the specified words.

   <p>For even greater flexibility, you can specify a regular expression
(see <a href="#Regexps">Regexps</a>).  An apropos pattern is interpreted as a regular
expression if it contains any of the regular expression special
characters, `<samp><span class="samp">^$*+?.\[</span></samp>'.

   <p>Following the conventions for naming Emacs commands, here are some
words that you'll find useful in apropos patterns.  By using them in
<kbd>C-h a</kbd>, you will also get a feel for the naming conventions.

   <blockquote>
char, line, word, sentence, paragraph, region, page, sexp, list, defun,
rect, buffer, frame, window, face, file, dir, register, mode, beginning, end,
forward, backward, next, previous, up, down, search, goto, kill, delete,
mark, insert, yank, fill, indent, case, change, set, what, list, find,
view, describe, default. 
</blockquote>

   <p><a name="index-apropos_002ddo_002dall-295"></a>  If the variable <code>apropos-do-all</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, most
apropos commands behave as if they had been given a prefix argument. 
There is one exception: <code>apropos-variable</code> without a prefix
argument will always search for all variables, no matter what the
value of <code>apropos-do-all</code> is.

   <p><a name="index-apropos_002dsort_002dby_002dscores-296"></a><a name="index-apropos-search-results_002c-order-by-score-297"></a><a name="index-apropos_002ddocumentation_002dsort_002dby_002dscores-298"></a>  By default, all apropos commands except <code>apropos-documentation</code>
list their results in alphabetical order.  If the variable
<code>apropos-sort-by-scores</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, these commands
instead try to guess the relevance of each result, and display the
most relevant ones first.  The <code>apropos-documentation</code> command
lists its results in order of relevance by default; to list them in
alphabetical order, change the variable
<code>apropos-documentation-sort-by-scores</code> to <code>nil</code>.

<h3 class="section">10.5 Help Mode Commands</h3>

<p>Help buffers provide the same commands as View mode (see <a href="#View-Mode">View Mode</a>); for instance, &lt;SPC&gt; scrolls forward, and &lt;DEL&gt; or
<kbd>S-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> scrolls backward.  A few special commands are also
provided:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>&lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Follow a cross reference at point (<code>help-follow</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd><dd>Move point forward to the next hyperlink (<code>forward-button</code>).

<br><dt><kbd>C-c C-f</kbd><dd>Go forward to the next help topic (<code>help-go-forward</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-c C-b</kbd><dd>Go back to the previous help topic (<code>help-go-back</code>).

appears in the documentation in the help buffer, it is normally an
underlined <dfn>hyperlink</dfn>.  To view the associated documentation,
move point there and type &lt;RET&gt; (<code>help-follow</code>), or click on
the hyperlink with <kbd>mouse-1</kbd> or <kbd>mouse-2</kbd>.  Doing so replaces
the contents of the help buffer; to retrace your steps, type <kbd>C-c
C-b</kbd> (<code>help-go-back</code>).  While retracing your steps, you can go

forward to the next hyperlink, while <kbd>S-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>
(<code>backward-button</code>) point back to the previous hyperlink.  These

<h3 class="section">10.6 Keyword Search for Packages</h3>

<p><a name="index-finder-315"></a>
Most optional features in Emacs are grouped into <dfn>packages</dfn>. 
Emacs contains several hundred built-in packages, and more can be
installed over the network (see <a href="#Packages">Packages</a>).

   <p><a name="index-C_002dh-p-316"></a><a name="index-finder_002dby_002dkeyword-317"></a>  To make it easier to find packages related to a topic, most packages
are associated with one or more <dfn>keywords</dfn> based on what they do. 
Type <kbd>C-h p</kbd> (<code>finder-by-keyword</code>) to bring up a list of
package keywords, together with a description of what the keywords
mean.  To view a list of packages for a given keyword, type &lt;RET&gt;
on that line; this displays the list of packages in a Package Menu
buffer (see <a href="#Package-Menu">Package Menu</a>).

   <p><a name="index-describe_002dpackage-318"></a><a name="index-C_002dh-P-319"></a>  <kbd>C-h P</kbd> (<code>describe-package</code>) prompts for the name of a
package, and displays a help buffer describing the attributes of the
package and the features that it implements.  The buffer lists the
keywords that relate to the package in the form of buttons.  Click on
a button to see other packages related to that keyword.

<p>For information on a specific language environment (see <a href="#Language-Environments">Language Environments</a>), type <kbd>C-h L</kbd>
(<code>describe-language-environment</code>).  This displays a help buffer
describing the languages supported by the language environment, and

how to say &ldquo;hello&rdquo; in many languages.

   <p>The command <kbd>C-h I</kbd> (<code>describe-input-method</code>) describes an
input method&mdash;either a specified input method, or by default the
input method currently in use.  See <a href="#Input-Methods">Input Methods</a>.

   <p>The command <kbd>C-h C</kbd> (<code>describe-coding-system</code>) describes

structured documentation files.  The entire Emacs manual is available
within Info, along with many other manuals for the GNU system.  Type
<kbd>h</kbd> after entering Info to run a tutorial on using Info.

   <p><a name="index-find-Info-manual-by-its-file-name-324"></a>  With a numeric argument <var>n</var>, <kbd>C-h i</kbd> selects the Info buffer
`<samp><span class="samp">*info*&lt;</span><var>n</var><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>'.  This is useful if you want to browse multiple
Info manuals simultaneously.  If you specify just <kbd>C-u</kbd> as the
prefix argument, <kbd>C-h i</kbd> prompts for the name of a documentation
file, so you can browse a file which doesn't have an entry in the
top-level Info menu.

   <p>The help commands <kbd>C-h F </kbd><var>function</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> and <kbd>C-h
K </kbd><var>key</var>, described above, enter Info and go straight to the

   <p><a name="index-C_002dh-S-325"></a><a name="index-info_002dlookup_002dsymbol-326"></a>  When editing a program, if you have an Info version of the manual
for the programming language, you can use <kbd>C-h S</kbd>
(<code>info-lookup-symbol</code>) to find an entry for a symbol (keyword,
function or variable) in the proper manual.  The details of how this
command works depend on the major mode.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dh-l-327"></a><a name="index-view_002dlossage-328"></a>  If something surprising happens, and you are not sure what you typed,
use <kbd>C-h l</kbd> (<code>view-lossage</code>).  <kbd>C-h l</kbd> displays your last
300 input keystrokes and the commands they invoked.  If you see
commands that you are not familiar with, you can use <kbd>C-h k</kbd> or
<kbd>C-h f</kbd> to find out what they do.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dh-e-329"></a><a name="index-view_002decho_002darea_002dmessages-330"></a>  To review recent echo area messages, use <kbd>C-h e</kbd>
(<code>view-echo-area-messages</code>).  This displays the buffer
<samp><span class="file">*Messages*</span></samp>, where those messages are kept.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dh-m-331"></a><a name="index-describe_002dmode-332"></a>  Each Emacs major mode typically redefines a few keys and makes other
changes in how editing works.  <kbd>C-h m</kbd> (<code>describe-mode</code>)

(<code>describe-syntax</code>) show other information about the current
environment within Emacs.  <kbd>C-h b</kbd> displays a list of all the key
bindings now in effect: first the local bindings of the current minor
modes, then the local bindings defined by the current major mode, and
finally the global bindings (see <a href="#Key-Bindings">Key Bindings</a>).  <kbd>C-h s</kbd>
displays the contents of the syntax table, with explanations of each
character's syntax (see <a href="elisp.html#Syntax-Tables">Syntax Tables</a>).

   <p><a name="index-describe_002dprefix_002dbindings-337"></a>  You can get a list of subcommands for a particular prefix key by
typing <kbd>C-h</kbd>, <kbd>?</kbd>, or &lt;F1&gt;
(<code>describe-prefix-bindings</code>) after the prefix key.  (There are a
few prefix keys for which not all of these keys work&mdash;those that
provide their own bindings for that key.  One of these prefix keys
is &lt;ESC&gt;, because <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; C-h</kbd> is actually <kbd>C-M-h</kbd>,
which marks a defun.  However, <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; &lt;F1&gt;</kbd> and
<kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; ?</kbd> work fine.)

<h2 class="chapter">11 The Mark and the Region</h2>

<p><a name="index-mark-366"></a><a name="index-setting-a-mark-367"></a><a name="index-region-368"></a>
  Many Emacs commands operate on an arbitrary contiguous part of the
current buffer.  To specify the text for such a command to operate on,
you set <dfn>the mark</dfn> at one end of it, and move point to the other
end.  The text between point and the mark is called <dfn>the region</dfn>. 
The region always extends between point and the mark, no matter which
one comes earlier in the text; each time you move point, the region
changes.

   <p><a name="index-active-region-369"></a>  Setting the mark at a position in the text also <dfn>activates</dfn> it. 
When the mark is active, we say also that the region is active; Emacs
indicates its extent by highlighting the text within it, using the
<code>region</code> face (see <a href="#Face-Customization">Face Customization</a>).

   <p>After certain non-motion commands, including any command that
changes the text in the buffer, Emacs automatically <dfn>deactivates</dfn>
the mark; this turns off the highlighting.  You can also explicitly
deactivate the mark at any time, by typing <kbd>C-g</kbd>
(see <a href="#Quitting">Quitting</a>).

   <p>The above default behavior is known as Transient Mark mode. 
Disabling Transient Mark mode switches Emacs to an alternative
behavior, in which the region is usually not highlighted. 
See <a href="#Disabled-Transient-Mark">Disabled Transient Mark</a>.

   <p><a name="index-highlight_002dnonselected_002dwindows-370"></a>  Setting the mark in one buffer has no effect on the marks in other
buffers.  When you return to a buffer with an active mark, the mark is
at the same place as before.  When multiple windows show the same
buffer, they can have different values of point, and thus different
regions, but they all share one common mark position.  See <a href="#Windows">Windows</a>. 
Ordinarily, only the selected window highlights its region; however,
if the variable <code>highlight-nonselected-windows</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>, each window highlights its own region.

   <p>There is another kind of region: the rectangular region.

<h3 class="section">11.1 Setting the Mark</h3>

<p>Here are some commands for setting the mark:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd><dd>Set the mark at point, and activate it (<code>set-mark-command</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-@</kbd><dd>The same. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x C-x</kbd><dd>Set the mark at point, and activate it; then move point where the mark
used to be (<code>exchange-point-and-mark</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>Drag-mouse-1</kbd><dd>Set point and the mark around the text you drag across. 
<br><dt><kbd>mouse-3</kbd><dd>Set the mark at point, then move point to where you click
(<code>mouse-save-then-kill</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>`<samp></kbd><span class="samp">Shifted cursor motion keys</span><kbd></samp>'</kbd><dd>Set the mark at point if the mark is inactive, then move point. 
See <a href="#Shift-Selection">Shift Selection</a>. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dSPC-371"></a><a name="index-C_002d_0040_0040-372"></a><a name="index-set_002dmark_002dcommand-373"></a>  The most common way to set the mark is with <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>
(<code>set-mark-command</code>)<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-5" name="fnd-5"><sup>5</sup></a>.  This sets the mark where point is,
and activates it.  You can then move point away, leaving the mark
behind.

   <p>For example, suppose you wish to convert part of the buffer to upper
case.  To accomplish this, go to one end of the desired text, type
<kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>, and move point until the desired portion of text is
highlighted.  Now type <kbd>C-x C-u</kbd> (<code>upcase-region</code>).  This
converts the text in the region to upper case, and then deactivates
the mark.

   <p>Whenever the mark is active, you can deactivate it by typing
<kbd>C-g</kbd> (see <a href="#Quitting">Quitting</a>).  Most commands that operate on the
region also automatically deactivate the mark, like <kbd>C-x C-u</kbd> in
the above example.

   <p>Instead of setting the mark in order to operate on a region, you can
also use it to remember a position in the buffer (by typing
<kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt; C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>), and later jump back there (by typing
<kbd>C-u C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>).  See <a href="#Mark-Ring">Mark Ring</a>, for details.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dx-374"></a><a name="index-exchange_002dpoint_002dand_002dmark-375"></a>  The command <kbd>C-x C-x</kbd> (<code>exchange-point-and-mark</code>) exchanges
the positions of point and the mark.  <kbd>C-x C-x</kbd> is useful when you
are satisfied with the position of point but want to move the other
end of the region (where the mark is).  Using <kbd>C-x C-x</kbd> a second
time, if necessary, puts the mark at the new position with point back
at its original position.  Normally, if the mark is inactive, this
command first reactivates the mark wherever it was last set, to ensure
that the region is left highlighted.  However, if you call it with a
prefix argument, it leaves the mark inactive and the region
unhighlighted; you can use this to jump to the mark in a manner
similar to <kbd>C-u C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>.

   <p>You can also set the mark with the mouse.  If you press the left
mouse button (<kbd>down-mouse-1</kbd>) and drag the mouse across a range of
text, this sets the mark where you first pressed the mouse button and
puts point where you release it.  Alternatively, clicking the right
mouse button (<kbd>mouse-3</kbd>) sets the mark at point and then moves
point to where you clicked.  See <a href="#Mouse-Commands">Mouse Commands</a>, for a more
detailed description of these mouse commands.

   <p><a name="index-shift_002dselection-376"></a>  Finally, you can set the mark by holding down the shift key while
typing certain cursor motion commands (such as <kbd>S-&lt;RIGHT&gt;</kbd>,
<kbd>S-C-f</kbd>, <kbd>S-C-n</kbd>, etc.).  This is called <dfn>shift-selection</dfn>. 
It sets the mark at point before moving point, but only if there is no
active mark set via shift-selection.  The mark set by mouse commands
and by shift-selection behaves slightly differently from the usual
mark: any subsequent unshifted cursor motion command deactivates it
automatically.  For details, See <a href="#Shift-Selection">Shift Selection</a>.

   <p>Many commands that insert text, such as <kbd>C-y</kbd> (<code>yank</code>), set
the mark at the other end of the inserted text, without activating it. 
This lets you easily return to that position (see <a href="#Mark-Ring">Mark Ring</a>).  You
can tell that a command does this when it shows `<samp><span class="samp">Mark set</span></samp>' in the
echo area.

   <p><a name="index-primary-selection-377"></a>  Under X, every time the active region changes, Emacs saves the text
in the region to the <dfn>primary selection</dfn>.  This lets you insert
that text into other X applications with <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> clicks. 
See <a href="#Primary-Selection">Primary Selection</a>.

<h3 class="section">11.2 Commands to Mark Textual Objects</h3>

<p><a name="index-marking-sections-of-text-378"></a>  Here are commands for placing point and the mark around a textual
object such as a word, list, paragraph or page:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-@</kbd><dd>Set mark after end of next word (<code>mark-word</code>).  This does not
move point. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-M-@</kbd><dd>Set mark after end of following balanced expression
(<code>mark-sexp</code>).  This does not move point. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-h</kbd><dd>Move point to the beginning of the current paragraph, and set mark at
the end (<code>mark-paragraph</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-M-h</kbd><dd>Move point to the beginning of the current defun, and set mark at the
end (<code>mark-defun</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x C-p</kbd><dd>Move point to the beginning of the current page, and set mark at the
end (<code>mark-page</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x h</kbd><dd>Move point to the beginning of the buffer, and set mark at the end
(<code>mark-whole-buffer</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-M_002d_0040_0040-379"></a><a name="index-mark_002dword-380"></a>  <kbd>M-@</kbd> (<code>mark-word</code>) sets the mark at the end of the next
word (see <a href="#Words">Words</a>, for information about words).  Repeated
invocations of this command extend the region by advancing the mark
one word at a time.  As an exception, if the mark is active and
located before point, <kbd>M-@</kbd> moves the mark backwards from its
current position one word at a time.

   <p>This command also accepts a numeric argument <var>n</var>, which tells it
to advance the mark by <var>n</var> words.  A negative argument moves the
mark back by <var>n</var> words.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dM_002d_0040_0040-381"></a><a name="index-mark_002dsexp-382"></a>  Similarly, <kbd>C-M-@</kbd> (<code>mark-sexp</code>) puts the mark at the end
of the next balanced expression (see <a href="#Expressions">Expressions</a>).  Repeated
invocations extend the region to subsequent expressions, while
positive or negative numeric arguments move the mark forward or
backward by the specified number of expressions.

   <p>The other commands in the above list set both point and mark, so as
to delimit an object in the buffer.  <kbd>M-h</kbd> (<code>mark-paragraph</code>)
marks paragraphs (see <a href="#Paragraphs">Paragraphs</a>), <kbd>C-M-h</kbd> (<code>mark-defun</code>)
marks top-level definitions (see <a href="#Moving-by-Defuns">Moving by Defuns</a>), and <kbd>C-x
C-p</kbd> (<code>mark-page</code>) marks pages (see <a href="#Pages">Pages</a>).  Repeated
invocations again play the same role, extending the region to
consecutive objects; similarly, numeric arguments specify how many
objects to move the mark by.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-h-383"></a><a name="index-mark_002dwhole_002dbuffer-384"></a><a name="index-select-all-385"></a>  <kbd>C-x h</kbd> (<code>mark-whole-buffer</code>) sets up the entire buffer as
the region, by putting point at the beginning and the mark at the end.

<h3 class="section">11.3 Operating on the Region</h3>

<p><a name="index-operations-on-a-marked-region-386"></a>  Once you have a region, here are some of the ways you can operate on
it:

     <ul>
<li>Kill it with <kbd>C-w</kbd> (see <a href="#Killing">Killing</a>). 
<li>Copy it to the kill ring with <kbd>M-w</kbd> (see <a href="#Yanking">Yanking</a>). 
<li>Convert case with <kbd>C-x C-l</kbd> or <kbd>C-x C-u</kbd> (see <a href="#Case">Case</a>). 
<li>Undo changes within it using <kbd>C-u C-/</kbd> (see <a href="#Undo">Undo</a>). 
<li>Replace text within it using <kbd>M-%</kbd> (see <a href="#Query-Replace">Query Replace</a>). 
<li>Indent it with <kbd>C-x &lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> or <kbd>C-M-\</kbd> (see <a href="#Indentation">Indentation</a>). 
<li>Fill it as text with <kbd>M-x fill-region</kbd> (see <a href="#Filling">Filling</a>). 
<li>Check the spelling of words within it with <kbd>M-$</kbd> (see <a href="#Spelling">Spelling</a>). 
<li>Evaluate it as Lisp code with <kbd>M-x eval-region</kbd> (see <a href="#Lisp-Eval">Lisp Eval</a>). 
<li>Save it in a register with <kbd>C-x r s</kbd> (see <a href="#Registers">Registers</a>). 
<li>Save it in a buffer or a file (see <a href="#Accumulating-Text">Accumulating Text</a>). 
</ul>

   <p>Some commands have a default behavior when the mark is inactive, but
operate on the region if the mark is active.  For example, <kbd>M-$</kbd>
(<code>ispell-word</code>) normally checks the spelling of the word at
point, but it checks the text in the region if the mark is active
(see <a href="#Spelling">Spelling</a>).  Normally, such commands use their default
behavior if the region is empty (i.e., if mark and point are at the
same position).  If you want them to operate on the empty region,
change the variable <code>use-empty-active-region</code> to <code>t</code>.

   <p><a name="index-delete_002dactive_002dregion-387"></a>  As described in <a href="#Erasing">Erasing</a>, the &lt;DEL&gt;
(<code>backward-delete-char</code>) and &lt;delete&gt;
(<code>delete-forward-char</code>) commands also act this way.  If the mark
is active, they delete the text in the region.  (As an exception, if
you supply a numeric argument <var>n</var>, where <var>n</var> is not one, these
commands delete <var>n</var> characters regardless of whether the mark is
active).  If you change the variable <code>delete-active-region</code> to
<code>nil</code>, then these commands don't act differently when the mark is
active.  If you change the value to <code>kill</code>, these commands
<dfn>kill</dfn> the region instead of deleting it (see <a href="#Killing">Killing</a>).

   <p><a name="index-mark_002deven_002dif_002dinactive-388"></a>  Other commands always operate on the region, and have no default
behavior.  Such commands usually have the word <code>region</code> in their
names, like <kbd>C-w</kbd> (<code>kill-region</code>) and <code>C-x C-u</code>
(<code>upcase-region</code>).  If the mark is inactive, they operate on the
<dfn>inactive region</dfn>&mdash;that is, on the text between point and the
position at which the mark was last set (see <a href="#Mark-Ring">Mark Ring</a>).  To
disable this behavior, change the variable
<code>mark-even-if-inactive</code> to <code>nil</code>.  Then these commands will
instead signal an error if the mark is inactive.

   <p><a name="index-Delete-Selection-mode-389"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Delete-Selection-390"></a><a name="index-delete_002dselection_002dmode-391"></a>  By default, text insertion occurs normally even if the mark is
active&mdash;for example, typing <kbd>a</kbd> inserts the character `<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>',
then deactivates the mark.  Delete Selection mode, a minor mode,
modifies this behavior: if you enable that mode, then inserting text
while the mark is active causes the text in the region to be deleted
first.  Also, commands that normally delete just one character, such
as <kbd>C-d</kbd> or <kbd>&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd>, will delete the entire region
instead.  To toggle Delete Selection mode on or off, type <kbd>M-x
delete-selection-mode</kbd>.

<h3 class="section">11.4 The Mark Ring</h3>

<p><a name="index-mark-ring-392"></a>  Each buffer remembers previous locations of the mark, in the
<dfn>mark ring</dfn>.  Commands that set the mark also push the old mark
onto this ring.  One of the uses of the mark ring is to remember spots
that you may want to go back to.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt; C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd><dd>Set the mark, pushing it onto the mark ring, without activating it. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-u C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd><dd>Move point to where the mark was, and restore the mark from the ring
of former marks. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dSPC-C_002dSPC-393"></a>  The command <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt; C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> is handy when you want to
use the mark to remember a position to which you may wish to return. 
It pushes the current point onto the mark ring, without activating the
mark (which would cause Emacs to highlight the region).  This is
actually two consecutive invocations of <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>
(<code>set-mark-command</code>); the first <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> sets the mark,
and the second <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> deactivates it.  (When Transient Mark
mode is off, <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt; C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> instead activates Transient
Mark mode temporarily; see <a href="#Disabled-Transient-Mark">Disabled Transient Mark</a>.)

   <p><a name="index-C_002du-C_002dSPC-394"></a>  To return to a marked position, use <code>set-mark-command</code> with a
prefix argument: <kbd>C-u C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>.  This moves point to where the
mark was, and deactivates the mark if it was active.  Each subsequent
<kbd>C-u C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> jumps to a prior position stored in the mark
ring.  The positions you move through in this way are not lost; they
go to the end of the ring.

   <p><a name="index-set_002dmark_002dcommand_002drepeat_002dpop-395"></a>  If you set <code>set-mark-command-repeat-pop</code> to non-<code>nil</code>,
then immediately after you type <kbd>C-u C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>, you can type
<kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> instead of <kbd>C-u C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> to cycle through
the mark ring.  By default, <code>set-mark-command-repeat-pop</code> is
<code>nil</code>.

   <p>Each buffer has its own mark ring.  All editing commands use the
current buffer's mark ring.  In particular, <kbd>C-u C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>
always stays in the same buffer.

   <p><a name="index-mark_002dring_002dmax-396"></a>  The variable <code>mark-ring-max</code> specifies the maximum number of
entries to keep in the mark ring.  This defaults to 16 entries.  If
that many entries exist and another one is pushed, the earliest one in
the list is discarded.  Repeating <kbd>C-u C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> cycles through
the positions currently in the ring.

   <p>If you want to move back to the same place over and over, the mark
ring may not be convenient enough.  If so, you can record the position
in a register for later retrieval (see <a href="#Position-Registers">Saving Positions in Registers</a>).

<p><a name="index-global-mark-ring-397"></a>
<a name="index-global_002dmark_002dring_002dmax-398"></a>  In addition to the ordinary mark ring that belongs to each buffer,
Emacs has a single <dfn>global mark ring</dfn>.  Each time you set a mark,
this is recorded in the global mark ring in addition to the current
buffer's own mark ring, if you have switched buffers since the
previous mark setting.  Hence, the global mark ring records a sequence
of buffers that you have been in, and, for each buffer, a place where
you set the mark.  The length of the global mark ring is controlled by
<code>global-mark-ring-max</code>, and is 16 by default.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002d_0040key_007bSPC_007d-399"></a><a name="index-pop_002dglobal_002dmark-400"></a>  The command <kbd>C-x C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> (<code>pop-global-mark</code>) jumps to
the buffer and position of the latest entry in the global ring.  It also
rotates the ring, so that successive uses of <kbd>C-x C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> take
you to earlier buffers and mark positions.

<h3 class="section">11.6 Shift Selection</h3>

<p><a name="index-shift_002dselection-401"></a>
  If you hold down the shift key while typing a cursor motion command,
this sets the mark before moving point, so that the region extends
from the original position of point to its new position.  This feature
is referred to as <dfn>shift-selection</dfn>.  It is similar to the way
text is selected in other editors.

   <p>The mark set via shift-selection behaves a little differently from
what we have described above.  Firstly, in addition to the usual ways
of deactivating the mark (such as changing the buffer text or typing
<kbd>C-g</kbd>), the mark is deactivated by any <em>unshifted</em> cursor
motion command.  Secondly, any subsequent <em>shifted</em> cursor motion
command avoids setting the mark anew.  Therefore, a series of shifted
cursor motion commands will continuously adjust the region.

   <p>Shift-selection only works if the shifted cursor motion key is not
already bound to a separate command (see <a href="#Customization">Customization</a>).  For
example, if you bind <kbd>S-C-f</kbd> to another command, typing
<kbd>S-C-f</kbd> runs that command instead of performing a shift-selected
version of <kbd>C-f</kbd> (<code>forward-char</code>).

   <p>A mark set via mouse commands behaves the same as a mark set via
shift-selection (see <a href="#Setting-Mark">Setting Mark</a>).  For example, if you specify a
region by dragging the mouse, you can continue to extend the region
using shifted cursor motion commands.  In either case, any unshifted
cursor motion command deactivates the mark.

   <p>To turn off shift-selection, set <code>shift-select-mode</code> to
<code>nil</code>.  Doing so does not disable setting the mark via mouse
commands.

<h3 class="section">11.7 Disabling Transient Mark Mode</h3>

  The default behavior of the mark and region, in which setting the
mark activates it and highlights the region, is called Transient Mark
mode.  This is a minor mode that is enabled by default.  It can be
toggled with <kbd>M-x transient-mark-mode</kbd>, or with the `<samp><span class="samp">Active
Region Highlighting</span></samp>' menu item in the `<samp><span class="samp">Options</span></samp>' menu.  Turning it
off switches Emacs to an alternative mode of operation:

     <ul>
<li>Setting the mark, with commands like <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> or <kbd>C-x
C-x</kbd>, does not highlight the region.  Therefore, you can't tell by
looking where the mark is located; you have to remember.

     <p>The usual solution to this problem is to set the mark and then use it
soon, before you forget where it is.  You can also check where the
mark is by using <kbd>C-x C-x</kbd>, which exchanges the positions of the
point and the mark (see <a href="#Setting-Mark">Setting Mark</a>).

     <li>Some commands, which ordinarily act on the region when the mark is
active, no longer do so.  For example, normally <kbd>M-%</kbd>
(<code>query-replace</code>) performs replacements within the region, if the
mark is active.  When Transient Mark mode is off, it always operates
from point to the end of the buffer.  Commands that act this way are
identified in their own documentation. 
</ul>

   <p>While Transient Mark mode is off, you can activate it temporarily
using <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt; C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> or <kbd>C-u C-x C-x</kbd>.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt; C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002d_0040key_007bSPC_007d-C_002d_0040key_007bSPC_007d-408"></a>Set the mark at point (like plain <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>) and enable
Transient Mark mode just once, until the mark is deactivated.  (This
is not really a separate command; you are using the <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>
command twice.)

     <br><dt><kbd>C-u C-x C-x</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002du-C_002dx-C_002dx-409"></a>Exchange point and mark, activate the mark and enable Transient Mark
mode temporarily, until the mark is next deactivated.  (This is the
<kbd>C-x C-x</kbd> command, <code>exchange-point-and-mark</code>, with a prefix
argument.) 
</dl>

   <p>These commands set or activate the mark, and enable Transient Mark
mode only until the mark is deactivated.  One reason you may want to
use them is that some commands operate on the entire buffer instead of
the region when Transient Mark mode is off.  Enabling Transient Mark
mode momentarily gives you a way to use these commands on the region.

   <p>When you specify a region with the mouse (see <a href="#Setting-Mark">Setting Mark</a>), or
with shift-selection (see <a href="#Shift-Selection">Shift Selection</a>), this likewise
activates Transient Mark mode temporarily and highlights the region.

<h2 class="chapter">12 Killing and Moving Text</h2>

<p>In Emacs, <dfn>killing</dfn> means erasing text and copying it into the
<dfn>kill ring</dfn>.  <dfn>Yanking</dfn> means bringing text from the kill ring
back into the buffer.  (Some applications use the terms &ldquo;cutting&rdquo;
and &ldquo;pasting&rdquo; for similar operations.)  The kill ring is so-named
because it can be visualized as a set of blocks of text arranged in a
ring, which you can access in cyclic order.  See <a href="#Kill-Ring">Kill Ring</a>.

   <p>Killing and yanking are the most common way to move or copy text
within Emacs.  It is very versatile, because there are commands for
killing many different types of syntactic units.

<h3 class="section">12.1 Deletion and Killing</h3>

<p><a name="index-killing-text-410"></a><a name="index-cutting-text-411"></a><a name="index-deletion-412"></a>  Most commands which erase text from the buffer save it in the kill
ring.  These are known as <dfn>kill</dfn> commands, and their names
normally contain the word `<samp><span class="samp">kill</span></samp>' (e.g., <code>kill-line</code>).  The
kill ring stores several recent kills, not just the last one, so
killing is a very safe operation: you don't have to worry much about
losing text that you previously killed.  The kill ring is shared by
all buffers, so text that is killed in one buffer can be yanked into
another buffer.

   <p>When you use <kbd>C-/</kbd> (<code>undo</code>) to undo a kill command
(see <a href="#Undo">Undo</a>), that brings the killed text back into the buffer, but
does not remove it from the kill ring.

   <p>On graphical displays, killing text also copies it to the system
clipboard.  See <a href="#Cut-and-Paste">Cut and Paste</a>.

   <p>Commands that erase text but do not save it in the kill ring are
known as <dfn>delete</dfn> commands; their names usually contain the word
`<samp><span class="samp">delete</span></samp>'.  These include <kbd>C-d</kbd> (<code>delete-char</code>) and
&lt;DEL&gt; (<code>delete-backward-char</code>), which delete only one
character at a time, and those commands that delete only spaces or
newlines.  Commands that can erase significant amounts of nontrivial
data generally do a kill operation instead.

   <p>You can also use the mouse to kill and yank.  See <a href="#Cut-and-Paste">Cut and Paste</a>.

<p><a name="index-delete_002dbackward_002dchar-413"></a><a name="index-delete_002dchar-414"></a>
  Deletion means erasing text and not saving it in the kill ring.  For
the most part, the Emacs commands that delete text are those that
erase just one character or only whitespace.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd><dt><kbd>&lt;BACKSPACE&gt;</kbd><dd>Delete the previous character, or the text in the region if it is
active (<code>delete-backward-char</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>&lt;Delete&gt;</kbd><dd>Delete the next character, or the text in the region if it is active
(<code>delete-forward-char</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-d</kbd><dd>Delete the next character (<code>delete-char</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>M-\</kbd><dd>Delete spaces and tabs around point (<code>delete-horizontal-space</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd><dd>Delete spaces and tabs around point, leaving one space
(<code>just-one-space</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x C-o</kbd><dd>Delete blank lines around the current line (<code>delete-blank-lines</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-^</kbd><dd>Join two lines by deleting the intervening newline, along with any
indentation following it (<code>delete-indentation</code>). 
</dl>

   <p>We have already described the basic deletion commands &lt;DEL&gt;
(<code>delete-backward-char</code>), &lt;delete&gt;
(<code>delete-forward-char</code>), and <kbd>C-d</kbd> (<code>delete-char</code>). 
See <a href="#Erasing">Erasing</a>.  With a numeric argument, they delete the specified
number of characters.  If the numeric argument is omitted or one,
&lt;DEL&gt; and &lt;delete&gt; delete all the text in the region if it is
active (see <a href="#Using-Region">Using Region</a>).

   <p><a name="index-M_002d_005c-415"></a><a name="index-delete_002dhorizontal_002dspace-416"></a><a name="index-M_002dSPC-417"></a><a name="index-just_002done_002dspace-418"></a><a name="index-cycle_002dspacing-419"></a>  The other delete commands are those that delete only whitespace
characters: spaces, tabs and newlines.  <kbd>M-\</kbd>
(<code>delete-horizontal-space</code>) deletes all the spaces and tab
characters before and after point.  With a prefix argument, this only
deletes spaces and tab characters before point.  <kbd>M-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>
(<code>just-one-space</code>) does likewise but leaves a single space before
point, regardless of the number of spaces that existed previously
(even if there were none before).  With a numeric argument <var>n</var>, it
leaves <var>n</var> spaces before point if <var>n</var> is positive; if <var>n</var>
is negative, it deletes newlines in addition to spaces and tabs,
leaving <var>-n</var> spaces before point.  The command <code>cycle-spacing</code>
acts like a more flexible version of <code>just-one-space</code>.  It
does different things if you call it repeatedly in succession. 
The first call acts like <code>just-one-space</code>, the next removes
all whitespace, and a third call restores the original whitespace.

   <p><kbd>C-x C-o</kbd> (<code>delete-blank-lines</code>) deletes all blank lines
after the current line.  If the current line is blank, it deletes all
blank lines preceding the current line as well (leaving one blank line,
the current line).  On a solitary blank line, it deletes that line.

   <p><kbd>M-^</kbd> (<code>delete-indentation</code>) joins the current line and the
previous line, by deleting a newline and all surrounding spaces, usually
leaving a single space.  See <a href="#Indentation">M-^</a>.

<!-- Not really sure where to put this... -->
<p><a name="index-delete_002dduplicate_002dlines-420"></a>  The command <code>delete-duplicate-lines</code> searches the region for
identical lines, and removes all but one copy of each.  Normally it
keeps the first instance of each repeated line, but with a <kbd>C-u</kbd>
prefix argument it keeps the last.  With a <kbd>C-u C-u</kbd> prefix
argument, it only searches for adjacent identical lines.  This is a
more efficient mode of operation, useful when the lines have already
been sorted.  With a <kbd>C-u C-u C-u</kbd> prefix argument, it retains
repeated blank lines.

</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dk-421"></a><a name="index-kill_002dline-422"></a>  The simplest kill command is <kbd>C-k</kbd> (<code>kill-line</code>).  If used
at the end of a line, it kills the line-ending newline character,
merging the next line into the current one (thus, a blank line is
entirely removed).  Otherwise, <kbd>C-k</kbd> kills all the text from point
up to the end of the line; if point was originally at the beginning of
the line, this leaves the line blank.

   <p>Spaces and tabs at the end of the line are ignored when deciding
which case applies.  As long as point is after the last visible
character in the line, you can be sure that <kbd>C-k</kbd> will kill the
newline.  To kill an entire non-blank line, go to the beginning and
type <kbd>C-k</kbd> twice.

   <p>In this context, &ldquo;line&rdquo; means a logical text line, not a screen
line (see <a href="#Continuation-Lines">Continuation Lines</a>).

   <p>When <kbd>C-k</kbd> is given a positive argument <var>n</var>, it kills
<var>n</var> lines and the newlines that follow them (text on the current
line before point is not killed).  With a negative argument
&minus;<var>n</var>, it kills <var>n</var> lines preceding the current line,
together with the text on the current line before point.  <kbd>C-k</kbd>
with an argument of zero kills the text before point on the current
line.

   <p><a name="index-kill_002dwhole_002dline-423"></a>  If the variable <code>kill-whole-line</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, <kbd>C-k</kbd> at
the very beginning of a line kills the entire line including the
following newline.  This variable is normally <code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dS_002dbackspace-424"></a><a name="index-kill_002dwhole_002dline-425"></a>  <kbd>C-S-backspace</kbd> (<code>kill-whole-line</code>) kills a whole line
including its newline, regardless of the position of point within the
line.  Note that many text terminals will prevent you from typing the
key sequence <kbd>C-S-backspace</kbd>.

(<code>kill-region</code>), which kills the text in the region
(see <a href="#Mark">Mark</a>).  Similarly, <kbd>M-w</kbd> (<code>kill-ring-save</code>) copies
the text in the region into the kill ring without removing it from the
buffer.  If the mark is inactive when you type <kbd>C-w</kbd> or <kbd>M-w</kbd>,
the command acts on the text between point and where you last set the
mark (see <a href="#Using-Region">Using Region</a>).

   <p>Emacs also provides commands to kill specific syntactic units:
words, with <kbd>M-&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd> and <kbd>M-d</kbd> (see <a href="#Words">Words</a>); balanced
expressions, with <kbd>C-M-k</kbd> (see <a href="#Expressions">Expressions</a>); and sentences,
with <kbd>C-x &lt;DEL&gt;</kbd> and <kbd>M-k</kbd> (see <a href="#Sentences">Sentences</a>).

   <p><a name="index-M_002dz-432"></a><a name="index-zap_002dto_002dchar-433"></a>  The command <kbd>M-z</kbd> (<code>zap-to-char</code>) combines killing with
searching: it reads a character and kills from point up to (and
including) the next occurrence of that character in the buffer.  A
numeric argument acts as a repeat count; a negative argument means to
search backward and kill text before point.

<p><a name="index-kill_002dread_002donly_002dok-434"></a><a name="index-read_002donly-text_002c-killing-435"></a>  Some specialized buffers contain <dfn>read-only text</dfn>, which cannot
be modified and therefore cannot be killed.  The kill commands work
specially in a read-only buffer: they move over text and copy it to
the kill ring, without actually deleting it from the buffer. 
Normally, they also beep and display an error message when this
happens.  But if you set the variable <code>kill-read-only-ok</code> to a
non-<code>nil</code> value, they just print a message in the echo area to
explain why the text has not been erased.

   <p><a name="index-kill_002ddo_002dnot_002dsave_002dduplicates-436"></a>  If you change the variable <code>kill-do-not-save-duplicates</code> to a
non-<code>nil</code> value, identical subsequent kills yield a single
kill-ring entry, without duplication.

  <dfn>Yanking</dfn> means reinserting text previously killed.  The usual
way to move or copy text is to kill it and then yank it elsewhere.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-y</kbd><dd>Yank the last kill into the buffer, at point (<code>yank</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-y</kbd><dd>Replace the text just yanked with an earlier batch of killed text

previous kill (<code>append-next-kill</code>).  See <a href="#Appending-Kills">Appending Kills</a>. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dy-442"></a><a name="index-yank-443"></a>  The basic yanking command is <kbd>C-y</kbd> (<code>yank</code>).  It inserts
the most recent kill, leaving the cursor at the end of the inserted
text.  It also sets the mark at the beginning of the inserted text,
without activating the mark; this lets you jump easily to that
position, if you wish, with <kbd>C-u C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> (see <a href="#Mark-Ring">Mark Ring</a>).

   <p>With a plain prefix argument (<kbd>C-u C-y</kbd>), the command instead
leaves the cursor in front of the inserted text, and sets the mark at
the end.  Using any other prefix argument specifies an earlier kill;
e.g., <kbd>C-u 4 C-y</kbd> reinserts the fourth most recent kill. 
See <a href="#Earlier-Kills">Earlier Kills</a>.

   <p>On graphical displays, <kbd>C-y</kbd> first checks if another application
has placed any text in the system clipboard more recently than the
last Emacs kill.  If so, it inserts the clipboard's text instead. 
Thus, Emacs effectively treats &ldquo;cut&rdquo; or &ldquo;copy&rdquo; clipboard
operations performed in other applications like Emacs kills, except
that they are not recorded in the kill ring.  See <a href="#Cut-and-Paste">Cut and Paste</a>,
for details.

<h4 class="subsection">12.2.1 The Kill Ring</h4>

<p>The <dfn>kill ring</dfn> is a list of blocks of text that were previously
killed.  There is only one kill ring, shared by all buffers, so you
can kill text in one buffer and yank it in another buffer.  This is
the usual way to move text from one buffer to another.  (There are
several other methods: for instance, you could store the text in a
register; see <a href="#Registers">Registers</a>.  See <a href="#Accumulating-Text">Accumulating Text</a>, for some
other ways to move text around.)

   <p><a name="index-kill_002dring_002dmax-444"></a>  The maximum number of entries in the kill ring is controlled by the
variable <code>kill-ring-max</code>.  The default is 60.  If you make a new
kill when this limit has been reached, Emacs makes room by deleting
the oldest entry in the kill ring.

   <p><a name="index-kill_002dring-445"></a>  The actual contents of the kill ring are stored in a variable named
<code>kill-ring</code>; you can view the entire contents of the kill ring
with <kbd>C-h v kill-ring</kbd>.

<h4 class="subsection">12.2.2 Yanking Earlier Kills</h4>

<p><a name="index-yanking-previous-kills-446"></a>
  As explained in <a href="#Yanking">Yanking</a>, you can use a numeric argument to
<kbd>C-y</kbd> to yank text that is no longer the most recent kill.  This
is useful if you remember which kill ring entry you want.  If you
don't, you can use the <kbd>M-y</kbd> (<code>yank-pop</code>) command to cycle
through the possibilities.

   <p><a name="index-M_002dy-447"></a><a name="index-yank_002dpop-448"></a>  If the previous command was a yank command, <kbd>M-y</kbd> takes the text
that was yanked and replaces it with the text from an earlier kill. 
So, to recover the text of the next-to-the-last kill, first use
<kbd>C-y</kbd> to yank the last kill, and then use <kbd>M-y</kbd> to replace it
with the previous kill.  <kbd>M-y</kbd> is allowed only after a <kbd>C-y</kbd>
or another <kbd>M-y</kbd>.

   <p>You can understand <kbd>M-y</kbd> in terms of a last-yank pointer which
points at an entry in the kill ring.  Each time you kill, the last-yank
pointer moves to the newly made entry at the front of the ring. 
<kbd>C-y</kbd> yanks the entry which the last-yank pointer points to. 
<kbd>M-y</kbd> moves the last-yank pointer to a different entry, and the
text in the buffer changes to match.  Enough <kbd>M-y</kbd> commands can move
the pointer to any entry in the ring, so you can get any entry into the
buffer.  Eventually the pointer reaches the end of the ring; the next
<kbd>M-y</kbd> loops back around to the first entry again.

   <p><kbd>M-y</kbd> moves the last-yank pointer around the ring, but it does
not change the order of the entries in the ring, which always runs from
the most recent kill at the front to the oldest one still remembered.

   <p><kbd>M-y</kbd> can take a numeric argument, which tells it how many entries
to advance the last-yank pointer by.  A negative argument moves the
pointer toward the front of the ring; from the front of the ring, it
moves around to the last entry and continues forward from there.

   <p>Once the text you are looking for is brought into the buffer, you can
stop doing <kbd>M-y</kbd> commands and it will stay there.  It's just a copy
of the kill ring entry, so editing it in the buffer does not change
what's in the ring.  As long as no new killing is done, the last-yank
pointer remains at the same place in the kill ring, so repeating
<kbd>C-y</kbd> will yank another copy of the same previous kill.

   <p>When you call <kbd>C-y</kbd> with a numeric argument, that also sets the
last-yank pointer to the entry that it yanks.

<h4 class="subsection">12.2.3 Appending Kills</h4>

<p><a name="index-appending-kills-in-the-ring-449"></a>  Normally, each kill command pushes a new entry onto the kill ring. 
However, two or more kill commands in a row combine their text into a
single entry, so that a single <kbd>C-y</kbd> yanks all the text as a unit,
just as it was before it was killed.

   <p>Thus, if you want to yank text as a unit, you need not kill all of it
with one command; you can keep killing line after line, or word after
word, until you have killed it all, and you can still get it all back at
once.

   <p>Commands that kill forward from point add onto the end of the previous
killed text.  Commands that kill backward from point add text onto the
beginning.  This way, any sequence of mixed forward and backward kill
commands puts all the killed text into one entry without rearrangement. 
Numeric arguments do not break the sequence of appending kills.  For
example, suppose the buffer contains this text:

<pre class="example">     This is a line -!-of sample text.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">with point shown by -!-.  If you type <kbd>M-d M-&lt;DEL&gt; M-d
M-&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd>, killing alternately forward and backward, you end up with
`<samp><span class="samp">a line of sample</span></samp>' as one entry in the kill ring, and `<samp><span class="samp">This
is  text.</span></samp>' in the buffer.  (Note the double space between `<samp><span class="samp">is</span></samp>'
and `<samp><span class="samp">text</span></samp>', which you can clean up with <kbd>M-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> or
<kbd>M-q</kbd>.)

   <p>Another way to kill the same text is to move back two words with
<kbd>M-b M-b</kbd>, then kill all four words forward with <kbd>C-u M-d</kbd>. 
This produces exactly the same results in the buffer and in the kill
ring.  <kbd>M-f M-f C-u M-&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd> kills the same text, all going
backward; once again, the result is the same.  The text in the kill ring
entry always has the same order that it had in the buffer before you
killed it.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dM_002dw-450"></a><a name="index-append_002dnext_002dkill-451"></a>  If a kill command is separated from the last kill command by other
commands (not just numeric arguments), it starts a new entry on the
kill ring.  But you can force it to combine with the last killed text,
by typing <kbd>C-M-w</kbd> (<code>append-next-kill</code>) right beforehand.  The
<kbd>C-M-w</kbd> tells its following command, if it is a kill command, to
treat the kill as part of the sequence of previous kills.  As usual,
the kill is appended to the previous killed text if the command kills
forward, and prepended if the command kills backward.  In this way,
you can kill several separated pieces of text and accumulate them to
be yanked back in one place.

   <p>A kill command following <kbd>M-w</kbd> (<code>kill-ring-save</code>) does not
append to the text that <kbd>M-w</kbd> copied into the kill ring.

<p><a name="index-cut-452"></a><a name="index-copy-453"></a><a name="index-paste-454"></a>
  In most graphical desktop environments, you can transfer data
(usually text) between different applications using a system facility
called the <dfn>clipboard</dfn>.  On X, two other similar facilities are
available: the primary selection and the secondary selection.  When
Emacs is run on a graphical display, its kill and yank commands
integrate with these facilities, so that you can easily transfer text
between Emacs and other graphical applications.

   <p>By default, Emacs uses UTF-8 as the coding system for inter-program
text transfers.  If you find that the pasted text is not what you
expected, you can specify another coding system by typing <kbd>C-x
&lt;RET&gt; x</kbd> or <kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt; X</kbd>.  You can also request a
different data type by customizing <code>x-select-request-type</code>.

<h4 class="subsection">12.3.1 Using the Clipboard</h4>

<p><a name="index-clipboard-455"></a>
  The <dfn>clipboard</dfn> is the facility that most graphical applications
use for &ldquo;cutting and pasting&rdquo;.  When the clipboard exists, the kill
and yank commands in Emacs make use of it.

   <p>When you kill some text with a command such as <kbd>C-w</kbd>
(<code>kill-region</code>), or copy it to the kill ring with a command such
as <kbd>M-w</kbd> (<code>kill-ring-save</code>), that text is also put in the
clipboard.

   <p><a name="index-save_002dinterprogram_002dpaste_002dbefore_002dkill-456"></a>  When an Emacs kill command puts text in the clipboard, the existing
clipboard contents are normally lost.  Optionally, you can change
<code>save-interprogram-paste-before-kill</code> to <code>t</code>.  Then Emacs
will first save the clipboard to its kill ring, preventing you from
losing the old clipboard data&mdash;at the risk of high memory consumption
if that data turns out to be large.

   <p>Yank commands, such as <kbd>C-y</kbd> (<code>yank</code>), also use the
clipboard.  If another application &ldquo;owns&rdquo; the clipboard&mdash;i.e., if
you cut or copied text there more recently than your last kill command
in Emacs&mdash;then Emacs yanks from the clipboard instead of the kill
ring.

   <p><a name="index-yank_002dpop_002dchange_002dselection-457"></a>  Normally, rotating the kill ring with <kbd>M-y</kbd> (<code>yank-pop</code>)
does not alter the clipboard.  However, if you change
<code>yank-pop-change-selection</code> to <code>t</code>, then <kbd>M-y</kbd> saves the
new yank to the clipboard.

   <p><a name="index-select_002denable_002dclipboard-458"></a>  To prevent kill and yank commands from accessing the clipboard,
change the variable <code>select-enable-clipboard</code> to <code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-clipboard-manager-459"></a><a name="index-x_002dselect_002denable_002dclipboard_002dmanager-460"></a>  Many X desktop environments support a feature called the
<dfn>clipboard manager</dfn>.  If you exit Emacs while it is the current
&ldquo;owner&rdquo; of the clipboard data, and there is a clipboard manager
running, Emacs transfers the clipboard data to the clipboard manager
so that it is not lost.  In some circumstances, this may cause a delay
when exiting Emacs; if you wish to prevent Emacs from transferring
data to the clipboard manager, change the variable
<code>x-select-enable-clipboard-manager</code> to <code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-select_002denable_002dprimary-461"></a><a name="index-clipboard_002dkill_002dregion-462"></a><a name="index-clipboard_002dkill_002dring_002dsave-463"></a><a name="index-clipboard_002dyank-464"></a>  Prior to Emacs 24, the kill and yank commands used the primary
selection (see <a href="#Primary-Selection">Primary Selection</a>), not the clipboard.  If you
prefer this behavior, change <code>select-enable-clipboard</code> to
<code>nil</code>, <code>select-enable-primary</code> to <code>t</code>, and
<code>mouse-drag-copy-region</code> to <code>t</code>.  In this case, you can use
the following commands to act explicitly on the clipboard:
<code>clipboard-kill-region</code> kills the region and saves it to the
clipboard; <code>clipboard-kill-ring-save</code> copies the region to the
kill ring and saves it to the clipboard; and <code>clipboard-yank</code>
yanks the contents of the clipboard at point.

  Under the X Window System, there exists a <dfn>primary selection</dfn>
containing the last stretch of text selected in an X application
(usually by dragging the mouse).  Typically, this text can be inserted
into other X applications by <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> clicks.  The primary
selection is separate from the clipboard.  Its contents are more
fragile; they are overwritten each time you select text with the
mouse, whereas the clipboard is only overwritten by explicit cut
or copy commands.

   <p>Under X, whenever the region is active (see <a href="#Mark">Mark</a>), the text in
the region is saved in the primary selection.  This applies regardless
of whether the region was made by dragging or clicking the mouse
(see <a href="#Mouse-Commands">Mouse Commands</a>), or by keyboard commands (e.g., by typing
<kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> and moving point; see <a href="#Setting-Mark">Setting Mark</a>).

   <p><a name="index-select_002dactive_002dregions-469"></a>  If you change the variable <code>select-active-regions</code> to
<code>only</code>, Emacs saves only temporarily active regions to the
primary selection, i.e., those made with the mouse or with shift
selection (see <a href="#Shift-Selection">Shift Selection</a>).  If you change
<code>select-active-regions</code> to <code>nil</code>, Emacs avoids saving active
regions to the primary selection entirely.

   <p>To insert the primary selection into an Emacs buffer, click
<kbd>mouse-2</kbd> (<code>mouse-yank-primary</code>) where you want to insert it. 
See <a href="#Mouse-Commands">Mouse Commands</a>.

   <p><a name="index-MS_002dWindows_002c-and-primary-selection-470"></a>  MS-Windows provides no primary selection, but Emacs emulates it
within a single Emacs session by storing the selected text internally. 
Therefore, all the features and commands related to the primary
selection work on Windows as they do on X, for cutting and pasting
within the same session, but not across Emacs sessions or with other
applications.

<p><a name="index-secondary-selection-471"></a>
  In addition to the primary selection, the X Window System provides a
second similar facility known as the <dfn>secondary selection</dfn>. 
Nowadays, few X applications make use of the secondary selection, but
you can access it using the following Emacs commands:

     
<a name="index-mouse_002dset_002dsecondary-472"></a>
<a name="index-M_002dDrag_002dmouse_002d1-473"></a>
<a name="index-secondary_002dselection-face-474"></a>
<dl><dt><kbd>M-Drag-mouse-1</kbd><dd>Set the secondary selection, with one end at the place where you press
down the button, and the other end at the place where you release it
(<code>mouse-set-secondary</code>).  The selected text is highlighted, using
the <code>secondary-selection</code> face, as you drag.  The window scrolls
automatically if you drag the mouse off the top or bottom of the
window, just like <code>mouse-set-region</code> (see <a href="#Mouse-Commands">Mouse Commands</a>).

     <p>This command does not alter the kill ring.

     <p><a name="index-mouse_002dstart_002dsecondary-475"></a><a name="index-M_002dmouse_002d1-476"></a><br><dt><kbd>M-mouse-1</kbd><dd>Set one endpoint for the <dfn>secondary selection</dfn>
(<code>mouse-start-secondary</code>).

     <p><a name="index-mouse_002dsecondary_002dsave_002dthen_002dkill-477"></a><a name="index-M_002dmouse_002d3-478"></a><br><dt><kbd>M-mouse-3</kbd><dd>Set the secondary selection, with one end at the position clicked and
the other at the position specified with <kbd>M-mouse-1</kbd>
(<code>mouse-secondary-save-then-kill</code>).  This also puts the selected
text in the kill ring.  A second <kbd>M-mouse-3</kbd> at the same place
kills the secondary selection just made.

     <p><a name="index-mouse_002dyank_002dsecondary-479"></a><a name="index-M_002dmouse_002d2-480"></a><br><dt><kbd>M-mouse-2</kbd><dd>Insert the secondary selection where you click, placing point at the
end of the yanked text (<code>mouse-yank-secondary</code>). 
</dl>

   <p>Double or triple clicking of <kbd>M-mouse-1</kbd> operates on words and
lines, much like <kbd>mouse-1</kbd>.

   <p>If <code>mouse-yank-at-point</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, <kbd>M-mouse-2</kbd> yanks
at point.  Then it does not matter precisely where you click, or even
which of the frame's windows you click on.  See <a href="#Mouse-Commands">Mouse Commands</a>.

<h3 class="section">12.4 Accumulating Text</h3>

<p><a name="index-append_002dto_002dbuffer-481"></a><a name="index-prepend_002dto_002dbuffer-482"></a><a name="index-copy_002dto_002dbuffer-483"></a><a name="index-append_002dto_002dfile-484"></a>
<a name="index-accumulating-scattered-text-485"></a>  Usually we copy or move text by killing it and yanking it, but there
are other convenient methods for copying one block of text in many
places, or for copying many scattered blocks of text into one place. 
Here we describe the commands to accumulate scattered pieces of text
into a buffer or into a file.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-x append-to-buffer</kbd><dd>Append region to the contents of a specified buffer. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x prepend-to-buffer</kbd><dd>Prepend region to the contents of a specified buffer. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x copy-to-buffer</kbd><dd>Copy region into a specified buffer, deleting that buffer's old contents. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x insert-buffer</kbd><dd>Insert the contents of a specified buffer into current buffer at point. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x append-to-file</kbd><dd>Append region to the contents of a specified file, at the end. 
</dl>

   <p>To accumulate text into a buffer, use <kbd>M-x append-to-buffer</kbd>. 
This reads a buffer name, then inserts a copy of the region into the
buffer specified.  If you specify a nonexistent buffer,
<code>append-to-buffer</code> creates the buffer.  The text is inserted
wherever point is in that buffer.  If you have been using the buffer for
editing, the copied text goes into the middle of the text of the buffer,
starting from wherever point happens to be at that moment.

   <p>Point in that buffer is left at the end of the copied text, so
successive uses of <code>append-to-buffer</code> accumulate the text in the
specified buffer in the same order as they were copied.  Strictly
speaking, <code>append-to-buffer</code> does not always append to the text
already in the buffer&mdash;it appends only if point in that buffer is at
the end.  However, if <code>append-to-buffer</code> is the only command you
use to alter a buffer, then point is always at the end.

   <p><kbd>M-x prepend-to-buffer</kbd> is just like <code>append-to-buffer</code>
except that point in the other buffer is left before the copied text, so
successive prependings add text in reverse order.  <kbd>M-x
copy-to-buffer</kbd> is similar, except that any existing text in the other
buffer is deleted, so the buffer is left containing just the text newly
copied into it.

   <p>The command <kbd>M-x insert-buffer</kbd> can be used to retrieve the
accumulated text from another buffer.  This prompts for the name of a
buffer, and inserts a copy of all the text in that buffer into the
current buffer at point, leaving point at the beginning of the
inserted text.  It also adds the position of the end of the inserted
text to the mark ring, without activating the mark.  See <a href="#Buffers">Buffers</a>,
for background information on buffers.

   <p>Instead of accumulating text in a buffer, you can append text
directly into a file with <kbd>M-x append-to-file</kbd>.  This prompts for
a filename, and adds the text of the region to the end of the
specified file.  The file is changed immediately on disk.

   <p>You should use <code>append-to-file</code> only with files that are
<em>not</em> being visited in Emacs.  Using it on a file that you are
editing in Emacs would change the file behind Emacs's back, which
can lead to losing some of your editing.

   <p>Another way to move text around is to store it in a register.

<h3 class="section">12.5 Rectangles</h3>

<p><a name="index-rectangle-486"></a><a name="index-columns-_0028and-rectangles_0029-487"></a><a name="index-killing-rectangular-areas-of-text-488"></a>
  <dfn>Rectangle</dfn> commands operate on rectangular areas of the text:
all the characters between a certain pair of columns, in a certain
range of lines.  Emacs has commands to kill rectangles, yank killed
rectangles, clear them out, fill them with blanks or text, or delete
them.  Rectangle commands are useful with text in multicolumn formats,
and for changing text into or out of such formats.

   <p><a name="index-mark-rectangle-489"></a>  To specify a rectangle for a command to work on, set the mark at one
corner and point at the opposite corner.  The rectangle thus specified
is called the <dfn>region-rectangle</dfn>.  If point and the mark are in
the same column, the region-rectangle is empty.  If they are in the
same line, the region-rectangle is one line high.

   <p>The region-rectangle is controlled in much the same way as the
region is controlled.  But remember that a given combination of point
and mark values can be interpreted either as a region or as a
rectangle, depending on the command that uses them.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x r k</kbd><dd>Kill the text of the region-rectangle, saving its contents as the
last killed rectangle (<code>kill-rectangle</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x r M-w</kbd><dd>Save the text of the region-rectangle as the last killed rectangle
(<code>copy-rectangle-as-kill</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x r d</kbd><dd>Delete the text of the region-rectangle (<code>delete-rectangle</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x r y</kbd><dd>Yank the last killed rectangle with its upper left corner at point
(<code>yank-rectangle</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x r o</kbd><dd>Insert blank space to fill the space of the region-rectangle
(<code>open-rectangle</code>).  This pushes the previous contents of the
region-rectangle to the right. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x r N</kbd><dd>Insert line numbers along the left edge of the region-rectangle
(<code>rectangle-number-lines</code>).  This pushes the previous contents of
the region-rectangle to the right. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x r c</kbd><dd>Clear the region-rectangle by replacing all of its contents with spaces
(<code>clear-rectangle</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x delete-whitespace-rectangle</kbd><dd>Delete whitespace in each of the lines on the specified rectangle,
starting from the left edge column of the rectangle. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x r t </kbd><var>string</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Replace rectangle contents with <var>string</var> on each line
(<code>string-rectangle</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x string-insert-rectangle &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>string</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Insert <var>string</var> on each line of the rectangle. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x &lt;SPC&gt;</kbd><dd>Toggle Rectangle Mark mode (<code>rectangle-mark-mode</code>). 
When this mode is active, the region-rectangle is highlighted and can
be shrunk/grown, and the standard kill and yank commands operate on it. 
</dl>

   <p>The rectangle operations fall into two classes: commands to erase or
insert rectangles, and commands to make blank rectangles.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-r-k-490"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-r-d-491"></a><a name="index-kill_002drectangle-492"></a><a name="index-delete_002drectangle-493"></a>  There are two ways to erase the text in a rectangle: <kbd>C-x r d</kbd>
(<code>delete-rectangle</code>) to delete the text outright, or <kbd>C-x r
k</kbd> (<code>kill-rectangle</code>) to remove the text and save it as the
<dfn>last killed rectangle</dfn>.  In both cases, erasing the
region-rectangle is like erasing the specified text on each line of
the rectangle; if there is any following text on the line, it moves
backwards to fill the gap.

   <p>Killing a rectangle is not killing in the usual sense; the
rectangle is not stored in the kill ring, but in a special place that
only records the most recent rectangle killed.  This is because
yanking a rectangle is so different from yanking linear text that
different yank commands have to be used.  Yank-popping is not defined
for rectangles.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-r-M_002dw-494"></a><a name="index-copy_002drectangle_002das_002dkill-495"></a>  <kbd>C-x r M-w</kbd> (<code>copy-rectangle-as-kill</code>) is the equivalent of
<kbd>M-w</kbd> for rectangles: it records the rectangle as the last
killed rectangle, without deleting the text from the buffer.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-r-y-496"></a><a name="index-yank_002drectangle-497"></a>  To yank the last killed rectangle, type <kbd>C-x r y</kbd>
(<code>yank-rectangle</code>).  The rectangle's first line is inserted at
point, the rectangle's second line is inserted at the same horizontal
position one line vertically below, and so on.  The number of lines
affected is determined by the height of the saved rectangle.

   <p>For example, you can convert two single-column lists into a
double-column list by killing one of the single-column lists as a
rectangle, and then yanking it beside the other list.

   <p>You can also copy rectangles into and out of registers with <kbd>C-x r
r </kbd><var>r</var> and <kbd>C-x r i </kbd><var>r</var>.  See <a href="#Rectangle-Registers">Rectangle Registers</a>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-r-o-498"></a><a name="index-open_002drectangle-499"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-r-c-500"></a><a name="index-clear_002drectangle-501"></a>  There are two commands you can use for making blank rectangles:
<kbd>C-x r c</kbd> (<code>clear-rectangle</code>) blanks out existing text in the
region-rectangle, and <kbd>C-x r o</kbd> (<code>open-rectangle</code>) inserts a
blank rectangle.

   <p><a name="index-delete_002dwhitespace_002drectangle-502"></a>  <kbd>M-x delete-whitespace-rectangle</kbd> deletes horizontal whitespace
starting from a particular column.  This applies to each of the lines
in the rectangle, and the column is specified by the left edge of the
rectangle.  The right edge of the rectangle does not make any
difference to this command.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-r-N-503"></a><a name="index-rectangle-504"></a>  The command <kbd>C-x r N</kbd> (<code>rectangle-number-lines</code>) inserts
line numbers along the left edge of the region-rectangle.  Normally,
the numbering begins from 1 (for the first line of the rectangle). 
With a prefix argument, the command prompts for a number to begin
from, and for a format string with which to print the numbers
(see <a href="elisp.html#Formatting-Strings">Formatting Strings</a>).

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-r-t-505"></a><a name="index-string_002drectangle-506"></a>  The command <kbd>C-x r t</kbd> (<code>string-rectangle</code>) replaces the
contents of a region-rectangle with a string on each line.  The
string's width need not be the same as the width of the rectangle.  If
the string's width is less, the text after the rectangle shifts left;
if the string is wider than the rectangle, the text after the
rectangle shifts right.

   <p><a name="index-string_002dinsert_002drectangle-507"></a>  The command <kbd>M-x string-insert-rectangle</kbd> is similar to
<code>string-rectangle</code>, but inserts the string on each line,
shifting the original text to the right.

   <p><a name="index-rectangle_002dmark_002dmode-508"></a>  The command <kbd>C-x &lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> (<code>rectangle-mark-mode</code>) toggles
whether the region-rectangle or the standard region is highlighted
(first activating the region if necessary).  When this mode is enabled,
commands that resize the region (<kbd>C-f</kbd>, <kbd>C-n</kbd> etc.) do
so in a rectangular fashion, and killing and yanking operate on the
rectangle.  See <a href="#Killing">Killing</a>.  The mode persists only as long as the
region is active.

   <p>Unlike the standard region, the region-rectangle can have its corners
extended past the end of buffer, or inside stretches of white space
that point normally cannot enter, like the TAB.

   <p><a name="index-rectangle_002dexchange_002dpoint_002dand_002dmark-509"></a><a name="index-exchange_002dpoint_002dand_002dmark_0040r_007b_002c-in-rectangle_002dmark_002dmode_007d-510"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dx_0040r_007b_002c-in-rectangle_002dmark_002dmode_007d-511"></a>When the region is in rectangle-mark-mode, <kbd>C-x C-x</kbd> runs the
command <code>rectangle-exchange-point-and-mark</code>, which cycles between
the four corners of the region-rectangle.  This comes in handy if you
want to modify the dimensions of the region-rectangle before invoking
an operation on the marked text.

<h3 class="section">12.6 CUA Bindings</h3>

<p><a name="index-cua_002dmode-512"></a><a name="index-cua_002dmode-513"></a><a name="index-CUA-key-bindings-514"></a><a name="index-cua_002denable_002dcua_002dkeys-515"></a>  The command <kbd>M-x cua-mode</kbd> sets up key bindings that are
compatible with the Common User Access (CUA) system used in many other
applications.

   <p>When CUA mode is enabled, the keys <kbd>C-x</kbd>, <kbd>C-c</kbd>, <kbd>C-v</kbd>,
and <kbd>C-z</kbd> invoke commands that cut (kill), copy, paste (yank), and
undo respectively.  The <kbd>C-x</kbd> and <kbd>C-c</kbd> keys perform cut and
copy only if the region is active.  Otherwise, they still act as
prefix keys, so that standard Emacs commands like <kbd>C-x C-c</kbd> still
work.  Note that this means the variable <code>mark-even-if-inactive</code>
has no effect for <kbd>C-x</kbd> and <kbd>C-c</kbd> (see <a href="#Using-Region">Using Region</a>).

   <p>To enter an Emacs command like <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> while the mark is
active, use one of the following methods: either hold <kbd>Shift</kbd>
together with the prefix key, e.g., <kbd>S-C-x C-f</kbd>, or quickly type
the prefix key twice, e.g., <kbd>C-x C-x C-f</kbd>.

   <p>To disable the overriding of standard Emacs binding by CUA mode,
while retaining the other features of CUA mode described below, set
the variable <code>cua-enable-cua-keys</code> to <code>nil</code>.

   <p>CUA mode by default activates Delete-Selection mode (see <a href="#Mouse-Commands">Mouse Commands</a>)
so that typed text replaces the active region.  To use CUA without this
behavior, set the variable <code>cua-delete-selection</code> to <code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-rectangle-highlighting-516"></a>  CUA mode provides enhanced rectangle support with visible
rectangle highlighting.  Use <kbd>C-&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> to start a rectangle,
extend it using the movement commands, and cut or copy it using
<kbd>C-x</kbd> or <kbd>C-c</kbd>.  &lt;RET&gt; moves the cursor to the next
(clockwise) corner of the rectangle, so you can easily expand it in
any direction.  Normal text you type is inserted to the left or right
of each line in the rectangle (on the same side as the cursor).

   <p>You can use this rectangle support without activating CUA by calling the
<code>cua-rectangle-mark-mode</code> command.  But see also the standard
<code>rectangle-mark-mode</code>.  See <a href="#Rectangles">Rectangles</a>.

   <p>With CUA you can easily copy text and rectangles into and out of
registers by providing a one-digit numeric prefix to the kill, copy,
and yank commands, e.g., <kbd>C-1 C-c</kbd> copies the region into register
<code>1</code>, and <kbd>C-2 C-v</kbd> yanks the contents of register <code>2</code>.

   <p><a name="index-global-mark-517"></a>  CUA mode also has a global mark feature which allows easy moving and
copying of text between buffers.  Use <kbd>C-S-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> to toggle the
global mark on and off.  When the global mark is on, all text that you
kill or copy is automatically inserted at the global mark, and text
you type is inserted at the global mark rather than at the current
position.

   <p>For example, to copy words from various buffers into a word list in
a given buffer, set the global mark in the target buffer, then
navigate to each of the words you want in the list, mark it (e.g., with
<kbd>S-M-f</kbd>), copy it to the list with <kbd>C-c</kbd> or <kbd>M-w</kbd>, and
insert a newline after the word in the target list by pressing
&lt;RET&gt;.

<h2 class="chapter">13 Registers</h2>

<p><a name="index-registers-518"></a>
  Emacs <dfn>registers</dfn> are compartments where you can save text,
rectangles, positions, and other things for later use.  Once you save
text or a rectangle in a register, you can copy it into the buffer
once, or many times; once you save a position in a register, you can
jump back to that position once, or many times.

   <p>Each register has a name that consists of a single character, which
we will denote by <var>r</var>; <var>r</var> can be a letter (such as `<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>')
or a number (such as `<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>'); case matters, so register `<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>' is
not the same as register `<samp><span class="samp">A</span></samp>'.

   <p><a name="index-view_002dregister-519"></a>  A register can store a position, a piece of text, a rectangle, a
number, a window configuration, or a file name, but only one thing at
any given time.  Whatever you store in a register remains there until
you store something else in that register.  To see what register
<var>r</var> contains, use <kbd>M-x view-register</kbd>:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-x view-register &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>r</var><dd>Display a description of what register <var>r</var> contains. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-register_002dpreview_002ddelay-520"></a><a name="index-preview-of-registers-521"></a>  All of the commands that prompt for a register will display a
preview window that lists the existing registers (if there are
any) after a short delay.  To change the length of the delay,
customize <code>register-preview-delay</code>.  To prevent this display, set
that option to <code>nil</code>.  You can explicitly request a preview
window by pressing <kbd>C-h</kbd> or &lt;F1&gt;.

   <p><dfn>Bookmarks</dfn> record files and positions in them, so you can
return to those positions when you look at the file again.  Bookmarks
are similar in spirit to registers, so they are also documented in
this chapter.

  When you want to insert a copy of the same piece of text several
times, it may be inconvenient to yank it from the kill ring, since each
subsequent kill moves that entry further down the ring.  An alternative
is to store the text in a register and later retrieve it.

at the end of this command.  See <a href="#Mark">Mark</a>.  <kbd>C-u C-x r s </kbd><var>r</var>,
the same command with a prefix argument, copies the text into register
<var>r</var> and deletes the text from the buffer as well; you can think of
this as moving the region text into the register.

   <p><a name="index-append_002dto_002dregister-531"></a><a name="index-prepend_002dto_002dregister-532"></a>  <kbd>M-x append-to-register &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>r</var> appends the copy of
the text in the region to the text already stored in the register
named <var>r</var>.  If invoked with a prefix argument, it deletes the
region after appending it to the register.  The command
<code>prepend-to-register</code> is similar, except that it <em>prepends</em>
the region text to the text in the register instead of
<em>appending</em> it.

   <p><a name="index-register_002dseparator-533"></a>  When you are collecting text using <code>append-to-register</code> and
<code>prepend-to-register</code>, you may want to separate individual
collected pieces using a separator.  In that case, configure a
<code>register-separator</code> and store the separator text in to that
register.  For example, to get double newlines as text separator
during the collection process, you can use the following setting.

<pre class="example">     (setq register-separator ?+)
     (set-register register-separator "\n\n")

before, without activating it.  With a numeric argument, it instead
puts point before the text and the mark after.

<h3 class="section">13.5 Keeping Numbers in Registers</h3>

<p><a name="index-saving-number-in-a-register-544"></a>
  There are commands to store a number in a register, to insert
the number in the buffer in decimal, and to increment it.  These commands
can be useful in keyboard macros (see <a href="#Keyboard-Macros">Keyboard Macros</a>).

<p><a name="index-saving-file-name-in-a-register-549"></a>
  If you visit certain file names frequently, you can visit them more
conveniently if you put their names in registers.  Here's the Lisp code

<h3 class="section">13.8 Bookmarks</h3>

<p><a name="index-bookmarks-554"></a>
  <dfn>Bookmarks</dfn> are somewhat like registers in that they record
positions you can jump to.  Unlike registers, they have long names, and
they persist automatically from one Emacs session to the next.  The
prototypical use of bookmarks is to record where you were reading in
various files.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x r m &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Set the bookmark for the visited file, at point.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-x r m </kbd><var>bookmark</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Set the bookmark named <var>bookmark</var> at point (<code>bookmark-set</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-x r M </kbd><var>bookmark</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Like <kbd>C-x r m</kbd>, but don't overwrite an existing bookmark.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-x r b </kbd><var>bookmark</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-bookmark_002djump-555"></a>Jump to the bookmark named <var>bookmark</var> (<code>bookmark-jump</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-x r l</kbd><dd><a name="index-list_002dbookmarks-556"></a>List all bookmarks (<code>list-bookmarks</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x bookmark-save</kbd><dd><a name="index-bookmark_002dsave-557"></a>Save all the current bookmark values in the default bookmark file. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-r-m-558"></a><a name="index-bookmark_002dset-559"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-r-b-560"></a><a name="index-bookmark_002djump-561"></a>  The prototypical use for bookmarks is to record one current position
in each of several files.  So the command <kbd>C-x r m</kbd>, which sets a
bookmark, uses the visited file name as the default for the bookmark
name.  If you name each bookmark after the file it points to, then you
can conveniently revisit any of those files with <kbd>C-x r b</kbd>, and move
to the position of the bookmark at the same time.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-r-M-562"></a><a name="index-bookmark_002dset_002dno_002doverwrite-563"></a>  The command <kbd>C-x r M</kbd> (<code>bookmark-set-no-overwrite</code>) works
like <kbd>C-x r m</kbd>, but it signals an error if the specified bookmark
already exists, instead of overwriting it.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-r-l-564"></a>  To display a list of all your bookmarks in a separate buffer, type
<kbd>C-x r l</kbd> (<code>list-bookmarks</code>).  If you switch to that buffer,
you can use it to edit your bookmark definitions or annotate the
bookmarks.  Type <kbd>C-h m</kbd> in the bookmark buffer for more
information about its special editing commands.

   <p>When you kill Emacs, Emacs saves your bookmarks, if
you have changed any bookmark values.  You can also save the bookmarks
at any time with the <kbd>M-x bookmark-save</kbd> command.  Bookmarks are
saved to the file <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs.d/bookmarks</span></samp> (for compatibility with
older versions of Emacs, if you have a file named <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs.bmk</span></samp>,
that is used instead).  The bookmark commands load your default
bookmark file automatically.  This saving and loading is how bookmarks
persist from one Emacs session to the next.

   <p><a name="index-bookmark_002dsave_002dflag-565"></a>  If you set the variable <code>bookmark-save-flag</code> to 1, each command
that sets a bookmark will also save your bookmarks; this way, you
don't lose any bookmark values even if Emacs crashes.  The value, if
a number, says how many bookmark modifications should go by between
saving.  If you set this variable to <code>nil</code>, Emacs only
saves bookmarks if you explicitly use <kbd>M-x bookmark-save</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-bookmark_002ddefault_002dfile-566"></a>  The variable <code>bookmark-default-file</code> specifies the file in
which to save bookmarks by default.

   <p><a name="index-bookmark_002dsearch_002dsize-567"></a>  Bookmark position values are saved with surrounding context, so that
<code>bookmark-jump</code> can find the proper position even if the file is
modified slightly.  The variable <code>bookmark-search-size</code> says how
many characters of context to record on each side of the bookmark's
position.

   <p>Here are some additional commands for working with bookmarks:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-x bookmark-load &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>filename</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-bookmark_002dload-568"></a>Load a file named <var>filename</var> that contains a list of bookmark
values.  You can use this command, as well as <code>bookmark-write</code>, to
work with other files of bookmark values in addition to your default
bookmark file.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x bookmark-write &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>filename</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-bookmark_002dwrite-569"></a>Save all the current bookmark values in the file <var>filename</var>.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x bookmark-delete &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>bookmark</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-bookmark_002ddelete-570"></a>Delete the bookmark named <var>bookmark</var>.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x bookmark-insert-location &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>bookmark</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-bookmark_002dinsert_002dlocation-571"></a>Insert in the buffer the name of the file that bookmark <var>bookmark</var>
points to.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x bookmark-insert &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>bookmark</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-bookmark_002dinsert-572"></a>Insert in the buffer the <em>contents</em> of the file that bookmark
<var>bookmark</var> points to.

<h3 class="section">14.1 Scrolling</h3>

<p><a name="index-scrolling-573"></a>
  If a window is too small to display all the text in its buffer, it
displays only a portion of it.  <dfn>Scrolling</dfn> commands change which
portion of the buffer is displayed.

   <p>Scrolling forward or up advances the portion of the buffer
displayed in the window; equivalently, it moves the buffer text
upwards relative to the window.  Scrolling backward or down
displays an earlier portion of the buffer, and moves the text
downwards relative to the window.

   <p>In Emacs, scrolling up or down refers to the direction that
the text moves in the window, <em>not</em> the direction that the window
moves relative to the text.  This terminology was adopted by Emacs
before the modern meaning of &ldquo;scrolling up&rdquo; and &ldquo;scrolling down&rdquo;
became widespread.  Hence, the strange result that &lt;PageDown&gt;
scrolls up in the Emacs sense.

   <p>The portion of a buffer displayed in a window always contains point. 
If you move point past the bottom or top of the window, scrolling
occurs automatically to bring it back onscreen (see <a href="#Auto-Scrolling">Auto Scrolling</a>).  You can also scroll explicitly with these commands:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-v</kbd><dt><kbd>&lt;next&gt;</kbd><dt><kbd>&lt;PageDown&gt;</kbd><dd>Scroll forward by nearly a full window (<code>scroll-up-command</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-v</kbd><dt><kbd>&lt;prior&gt;</kbd><dt><kbd>&lt;PageUp&gt;</kbd><dd>Scroll backward (<code>scroll-down-command</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dv-574"></a><a name="index-M_002dv-575"></a><a name="index-next-576"></a><a name="index-prior-577"></a><a name="index-PageDown-578"></a><a name="index-PageUp-579"></a><a name="index-scroll_002dup_002dcommand-580"></a><a name="index-scroll_002ddown_002dcommand-581"></a>  <kbd>C-v</kbd> (<code>scroll-up-command</code>) scrolls forward by nearly the
whole window height.  The effect is to take the two lines at the
bottom of the window and put them at the top, followed by lines that
were not previously visible.  If point was in the text that scrolled
off the top, it ends up on the window's new topmost line.  The
&lt;next&gt; (or &lt;PageDown&gt;) key is equivalent to <kbd>C-v</kbd>.

   <p><kbd>M-v</kbd> (<code>scroll-down-command</code>) scrolls backward in a similar
way.  The &lt;prior&gt; (or &lt;PageUp&gt;) key is equivalent to
<kbd>M-v</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-next_002dscreen_002dcontext_002dlines-582"></a>  The number of lines of overlap left by these scroll commands is
controlled by the variable <code>next-screen-context-lines</code>, whose
default value is 2.  You can supply the commands with a numeric prefix
argument, <var>n</var>, to scroll by <var>n</var> lines; Emacs attempts to leave
point unchanged, so that the text and point move up or down together. 
<kbd>C-v</kbd> with a negative argument is like <kbd>M-v</kbd> and vice versa.

   <p><a name="index-scroll_002derror_002dtop_002dbottom-583"></a>  By default, these commands signal an error (by beeping or flashing
the screen) if no more scrolling is possible, because the window has
reached the beginning or end of the buffer.  If you change the
variable <code>scroll-error-top-bottom</code> to <code>t</code>, the command moves
point to the farthest possible position.  If point is already there,
the command signals an error.

   <p><a name="index-scroll_002dpreserve_002dscreen_002dposition-584"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bscroll_002dcommand_007d-property-585"></a>  Some users like scroll commands to keep point at the same screen
position, so that scrolling back to the same screen conveniently
returns point to its original position.  You can enable this behavior
via the variable <code>scroll-preserve-screen-position</code>.  If the value
is <code>t</code>, Emacs adjusts point to keep the cursor at the same screen
position whenever a scroll command moves it off-window, rather than
moving it to the topmost or bottommost line.  With any other
non-<code>nil</code> value, Emacs adjusts point this way even if the scroll
command leaves point in the window.  This variable affects all the
scroll commands documented in this section, as well as scrolling with
the mouse wheel (see <a href="#Mouse-Commands">Mouse Commands</a>); in general, it affects any
command that has a non-<code>nil</code> <code>scroll-command</code> property. 
See <a href="elisp.html#Property-Lists">Property Lists</a>.

   <p><a name="index-fast_002dbut_002dimprecise_002dscrolling-586"></a>  Sometimes, particularly when you hold down keys such as <kbd>C-v</kbd>
and <kbd>M-v</kbd>, activating keyboard auto-repeat, Emacs fails to keep up
with the rapid rate of scrolling requested; the display doesn't update
and Emacs can become unresponsive to input for quite a long time.  You
can counter this sluggishness by setting the variable
<code>fast-but-imprecise-scrolling</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> value.  This
instructs the scrolling commands not to fontify (see <a href="#Font-Lock">Font Lock</a>)
any unfontified text they scroll over, instead to assume it has the
default face.  This can cause Emacs to scroll to somewhat wrong buffer
positions when the faces in use are not all the same size, even with
single (i.e., without auto-repeat) scrolling operations.

similarly to <code>scroll-up-command</code> and <code>scroll-down-command</code>,
except they do not obey <code>scroll-error-top-bottom</code>.  Prior to
Emacs 24, these were the default commands for scrolling up and down. 
The commands <kbd>M-x scroll-up-line</kbd> and <kbd>M-x scroll-down-line</kbd>
scroll the current window by one line at a time.  If you intend to use
any of these commands, you might want to give them key bindings
(see <a href="#Init-Rebinding">Init Rebinding</a>).

   <p><a name="index-C_002dl-591"></a><a name="index-recenter_002dtop_002dbottom-592"></a>  The <kbd>C-l</kbd> (<code>recenter-top-bottom</code>) command <dfn>recenters</dfn>
the selected window, scrolling it so that the current screen line is
exactly in the center of the window, or as close to the center as
possible.

   <p>Typing <kbd>C-l</kbd> twice in a row (<kbd>C-l C-l</kbd>) scrolls the window
so that point is on the topmost screen line.  Typing a third <kbd>C-l</kbd>
scrolls the window so that point is on the bottom-most screen line. 
Each successive <kbd>C-l</kbd> cycles through these three positions.

   <p><a name="index-recenter_002dpositions-593"></a>  You can change the cycling order by customizing the list variable
<code>recenter-positions</code>.  Each list element should be the symbol
<code>top</code>, <code>middle</code>, or <code>bottom</code>, or a number; an integer
means to move the line to the specified screen line, while a
floating-point number between 0.0 and 1.0 specifies a percentage of
the screen space from the top of the window.  The default,
<code>(middle top bottom)</code>, is the cycling order described above. 
Furthermore, if you change the variable <code>scroll-margin</code> to a
non-zero value <var>n</var>, <kbd>C-l</kbd> always leaves at least <var>n</var>
screen lines between point and the top or bottom of the window
(see <a href="#Auto-Scrolling">Auto Scrolling</a>).

   <p>You can also give <kbd>C-l</kbd> a prefix argument.  A plain prefix
argument, <kbd>C-u C-l</kbd>, simply recenters point.  A positive argument
<var>n</var> puts point <var>n</var> lines down from the top of the window.  An
argument of zero puts point on the topmost line.  A negative argument
<var>-n</var> puts point <var>n</var> lines from the bottom of the window.  When
given an argument, <kbd>C-l</kbd> does not clear the screen or cycle
through different screen positions.

   <p><a name="index-recenter_002dredisplay-594"></a>  If the variable <code>recenter-redisplay</code> has a non-<code>nil</code>
value, each invocation of <kbd>C-l</kbd> also clears and redisplays the
screen; the special value <code>tty</code> (the default) says to do this on
text-terminal frames only.  Redisplaying is useful in case the screen
becomes garbled for any reason (see <a href="#Screen-Garbled">Screen Garbled</a>).

   <p><a name="index-recenter-595"></a>  The more primitive command <kbd>M-x recenter</kbd> behaves like
<code>recenter-top-bottom</code>, but does not cycle among screen positions.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dM_002dl-596"></a><a name="index-reposition_002dwindow-597"></a>  <kbd>C-M-l</kbd> (<code>reposition-window</code>) scrolls the current window
heuristically in a way designed to get useful information onto the
screen.  For example, in a Lisp file, this command tries to get the
entire current defun onto the screen if possible.

<h3 class="section">14.3 Automatic Scrolling</h3>

<p><a name="index-automatic-scrolling-598"></a>  Emacs performs <dfn>automatic scrolling</dfn> when point moves out of the
visible portion of the text.  Normally, automatic scrolling centers
point vertically in the window, but there are several ways to alter
this behavior.

   <p><a name="index-scroll_002dconservatively-599"></a>  If you set <code>scroll-conservatively</code> to a small number <var>n</var>,
then moving point just a little off the screen (no more than <var>n</var>
lines) causes Emacs to scroll just enough to bring point back on
screen; if doing so fails to make point visible, Emacs scrolls just
far enough to center point in the window.  If you set
<code>scroll-conservatively</code> to a large number (larger than 100),
automatic scrolling never centers point, no matter how far point
moves; Emacs always scrolls text just enough to bring point into view,
either at the top or bottom of the window depending on the scroll
direction.  By default, <code>scroll-conservatively</code> is&nbsp;<!-- /@w -->0, which
means to always center point in the window.

   <p><a name="index-scroll_002dstep-600"></a>  Another way to control automatic scrolling is to customize the
variable <code>scroll-step</code>.  Its value determines the number of lines
by which to automatically scroll, when point moves off the screen.  If
scrolling by that number of lines fails to bring point back into view,
point is centered instead.  The default value is zero, which (by
default) causes point to always be centered after scrolling.

   <p><a name="index-aggressive-scrolling-601"></a><a name="index-scroll_002dup_002daggressively-602"></a><a name="index-scroll_002ddown_002daggressively-603"></a>  A third way to control automatic scrolling is to customize the
variables <code>scroll-up-aggressively</code> and
<code>scroll-down-aggressively</code>, which directly specify the vertical
position of point after scrolling.  The value of
<code>scroll-up-aggressively</code> should be either <code>nil</code> (the
default), or a floating point number <var>f</var> between 0 and 1.  The
latter means that when point goes below the bottom window edge (i.e.,
scrolling forward), Emacs scrolls the window so that point is <var>f</var>
parts of the window height from the bottom window edge.  Thus, larger
<var>f</var> means more aggressive scrolling: more new text is brought into
view.  The default value, <code>nil</code>, is equivalent to 0.5.

   <p>Likewise, <code>scroll-down-aggressively</code> is used when point goes
above the bottom window edge (i.e., scrolling backward).  The value
specifies how far point should be from the top margin of the window
after scrolling.  Thus, as with <code>scroll-up-aggressively</code>, a
larger value is more aggressive.

   <p>Note that the variables <code>scroll-conservatively</code>,
<code>scroll-step</code>, and <code>scroll-up-aggressively</code> /
<code>scroll-down-aggressively</code> control automatic scrolling in
contradictory ways.  Therefore, you should pick no more than one of
these methods to customize automatic scrolling.  In case you customize
multiple variables, the order of priority is:
<code>scroll-conservatively</code>, then <code>scroll-step</code>, and finally
<code>scroll-up-aggressively</code> / <code>scroll-down-aggressively</code>.

   <p><a name="index-scroll_002dmargin-604"></a>  The variable <code>scroll-margin</code> restricts how close point can come
to the top or bottom of a window (even if aggressive scrolling
specifies a fraction <var>f</var> that is larger than the window portion
between the top and the bottom margins).  Its value is a number of screen
lines; if point comes within that many lines of the top or bottom of
the window, Emacs performs automatic scrolling.  By default,
<code>scroll-margin</code> is 0.

<h3 class="section">14.4 Horizontal Scrolling</h3>

<p><a name="index-horizontal-scrolling-605"></a>
<a name="index-auto_002dhscroll_002dmode-606"></a>  <dfn>Horizontal scrolling</dfn> means shifting all the lines sideways
within a window, so that some of the text near the left margin is not
displayed.  When the text in a window is scrolled horizontally, text
lines are truncated rather than continued (see <a href="#Line-Truncation">Line Truncation</a>). 
If a window shows truncated lines, Emacs performs automatic horizontal
scrolling whenever point moves off the left or right edge of the
screen.  To disable automatic horizontal scrolling, set the variable
<code>auto-hscroll-mode</code> to <code>nil</code>.  Note that when the automatic
horizontal scrolling is turned off, if point moves off the edge of the
screen, the cursor disappears to indicate that.  (On text terminals,
the cursor is left at the edge instead.)

   <p><a name="index-hscroll_002dmargin-607"></a>  The variable <code>hscroll-margin</code> controls how close point can get
to the window's left and right edges before automatic scrolling
occurs.  It is measured in columns.  For example, if the value is 5,
then moving point within 5 columns of an edge causes horizontal
scrolling away from that edge.

   <p><a name="index-hscroll_002dstep-608"></a>  The variable <code>hscroll-step</code> determines how many columns to
scroll the window when point gets too close to the edge.  Zero, the
default value, means to center point horizontally within the window. 
A positive integer value specifies the number of columns to scroll by. 
A floating-point number specifies the fraction of the window's width
to scroll by.

   <p>You can also perform explicit horizontal scrolling with the
following commands:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x &lt;</kbd><dd>Scroll text in current window to the left (<code>scroll-left</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x &gt;</kbd><dd>Scroll to the right (<code>scroll-right</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-_003c-609"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-_003e-610"></a><a name="index-scroll_002dleft-611"></a><a name="index-scroll_002dright-612"></a>  <kbd>C-x &lt;</kbd> (<code>scroll-left</code>) scrolls text in the selected window
to the left by the full width of the window, less two columns.  (In
other words, the text in the window moves left relative to the
window.)  With a numeric argument <var>n</var>, it scrolls by <var>n</var>
columns.

   <p>If the text is scrolled to the left, and point moves off the left
edge of the window, the cursor will freeze at the left edge of the
window, until point moves back to the displayed portion of the text. 
This is independent of the current setting of
<code>auto-hscroll-mode</code>, which, for text scrolled to the left, only
affects the behavior at the right edge of the window.

   <p><kbd>C-x &gt;</kbd> (<code>scroll-right</code>) scrolls similarly to the right. 
The window cannot be scrolled any farther to the right once it is
displayed normally, with each line starting at the window's left
margin; attempting to do so has no effect.  This means that you don't
have to calculate the argument precisely for <kbd>C-x&nbsp;&gt;</kbd><!-- /@w -->; any
sufficiently large argument will restore the normal display.

   <p>If you use those commands to scroll a window horizontally, that sets
a lower bound for automatic horizontal scrolling.  Automatic scrolling
will continue to scroll the window, but never farther to the right
than the amount you previously set by <code>scroll-left</code>.

<h3 class="section">14.5 Narrowing</h3>

<p><a name="index-widening-613"></a><a name="index-restriction-614"></a><a name="index-narrowing-615"></a><a name="index-accessible-portion-616"></a>
  <dfn>Narrowing</dfn> means focusing in on some portion of the buffer,
making the rest temporarily inaccessible.  The portion which you can
still get to is called the <dfn>accessible portion</dfn>.  Canceling the
narrowing, which makes the entire buffer once again accessible, is
called <dfn>widening</dfn>.  The bounds of narrowing in effect in a buffer
are called the buffer's <dfn>restriction</dfn>.

   <p>Narrowing can make it easier to concentrate on a single subroutine or
paragraph by eliminating clutter.  It can also be used to limit the
range of operation of a replace command or repeating keyboard macro.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x n n</kbd><dd>Narrow down to between point and mark (<code>narrow-to-region</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x n w</kbd><dd>Widen to make the entire buffer accessible again (<code>widen</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x n p</kbd><dd>Narrow down to the current page (<code>narrow-to-page</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x n d</kbd><dd>Narrow down to the current defun (<code>narrow-to-defun</code>). 
</dl>

   <p>When you have narrowed down to a part of the buffer, that part appears
to be all there is.  You can't see the rest, you can't move into it
(motion commands won't go outside the accessible part), you can't change
it in any way.  However, it is not gone, and if you save the file all
the inaccessible text will be saved.  The word `<samp><span class="samp">Narrow</span></samp>' appears in
the mode line whenever narrowing is in effect.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-n-n-617"></a><a name="index-narrow_002dto_002dregion-618"></a>  The primary narrowing command is <kbd>C-x n n</kbd> (<code>narrow-to-region</code>). 
It sets the current buffer's restrictions so that the text in the current
region remains accessible, but all text before the region or after the
region is inaccessible.  Point and mark do not change.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-n-p-619"></a><a name="index-narrow_002dto_002dpage-620"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-n-d-621"></a><a name="index-narrow_002dto_002ddefun-622"></a>  Alternatively, use <kbd>C-x n p</kbd> (<code>narrow-to-page</code>) to narrow
down to the current page.  See <a href="#Pages">Pages</a>, for the definition of a page. 
<kbd>C-x n d</kbd> (<code>narrow-to-defun</code>) narrows down to the defun
containing point (see <a href="#Defuns">Defuns</a>).

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-n-w-623"></a><a name="index-widen-624"></a>  The way to cancel narrowing is to widen with <kbd>C-x n w</kbd>
(<code>widen</code>).  This makes all text in the buffer accessible again.

   <p>You can get information on what part of the buffer you are narrowed down
to using the <kbd>C-x =</kbd> command.  See <a href="#Position-Info">Position Info</a>.

   <p>Because narrowing can easily confuse users who do not understand it,
<code>narrow-to-region</code> is normally a disabled command.  Attempting to use
this command asks for confirmation and gives you the option of enabling it;
if you enable the command, confirmation will no longer be required for
it.  See <a href="#Disabling">Disabling</a>.

<h3 class="section">14.8 Text Faces</h3>

<p><a name="index-faces-641"></a>
  Emacs can display text in several different styles, called
<dfn>faces</dfn>.  Each face can specify various <dfn>face attributes</dfn>,
such as the font, height, weight, slant, foreground and background
color, and underlining or overlining.  Most major modes assign faces
to the text automatically, via Font Lock mode.  See <a href="#Font-Lock">Font Lock</a>, for
more information about how these faces are assigned.

   <p><a name="index-list_002dfaces_002ddisplay-642"></a>  To see what faces are currently defined, and what they look like,
type <kbd>M-x list-faces-display</kbd>.  With a prefix argument, this
prompts for a regular expression, and displays only faces with names
matching that regular expression (see <a href="#Regexps">Regexps</a>).

   <p><a name="index-frame_002dbackground_002dmode-643"></a>  It's possible for a given face to look different in different
frames.  For instance, some text terminals do not support all face
attributes, particularly font, height, and width, and some support a
limited range of colors.  In addition, most Emacs faces are defined so
that their attributes are different on light and dark frame
backgrounds, for reasons of legibility.  By default, Emacs
automatically chooses which set of face attributes to display on each
frame, based on the frame's current background color.  However, you
can override this by giving the variable <code>frame-background-mode</code>
a non-<code>nil</code> value.  A value of <code>dark</code> makes Emacs treat all
frames as if they have a dark background, whereas a value of
<code>light</code> makes it treat all frames as if they have a light
background.

   <p><a name="index-background-color-644"></a><a name="index-default-face-645"></a>  You can customize a face to alter its attributes, and save those
customizations for future Emacs sessions.  See <a href="#Face-Customization">Face Customization</a>,
for details.

   <p>The <code>default</code> face is the default for displaying text, and all
of its attributes are specified.  Its background color is also used as
the frame's background color.  See <a href="#Colors">Colors</a>.

   <p><a name="index-cursor-face-646"></a>  Another special face is the <code>cursor</code> face.  On graphical
displays, the background color of this face is used to draw the text
cursor.  None of the other attributes of this face have any effect;
the foreground color for text under the cursor is taken from the
background color of the underlying text.  On text terminals, the
appearance of the text cursor is determined by the terminal, not by
the <code>cursor</code> face.

   <p>You can also use X resources to specify attributes of any particular
face.  See <a href="#Resources">Resources</a>.

   <p>Emacs can display variable-width fonts, but some Emacs commands,
particularly indentation commands, do not account for variable
character display widths.  Therefore, we recommend not using
variable-width fonts for most faces, particularly those assigned by
Font Lock mode.

<h3 class="section">14.9 Colors for Faces</h3>

<p><a name="index-color-name-647"></a><a name="index-RGB-triplet-648"></a>
  Faces can have various foreground and background colors.  When you
specify a color for a face&mdash;for instance, when customizing the face
(see <a href="#Face-Customization">Face Customization</a>)&mdash;you can use either a <dfn>color name</dfn>
or an <dfn>RGB triplet</dfn>.

   <p><a name="index-list_002dcolors_002ddisplay-649"></a><a name="index-list_002dcolors_002dsort-650"></a>  A color name is a pre-defined name, such as `<samp><span class="samp">dark orange</span></samp>' or
`<samp><span class="samp">medium sea green</span></samp>'.  To view a list of color names, type <kbd>M-x
list-colors-display</kbd>.  To control the order in which colors are shown,
customize <code>list-colors-sort</code>.  If you run this command on a
graphical display, it shows the full range of color names known to
Emacs (these are the standard X11 color names, defined in X's
<samp><span class="file">rgb.txt</span></samp> file).  If you run the command on a text terminal, it
shows only a small subset of colors that can be safely displayed on
such terminals.  However, Emacs understands X11 color names even on
text terminals; if a face is given a color specified by an X11 color
name, it is displayed using the closest-matching terminal color.

   <p>An RGB triplet is a string of the form `<samp><span class="samp">#RRGGBB</span></samp>'.  Each of the
R, G, and B components is a hexadecimal number specifying the
component's relative intensity, one to four digits long (usually two
digits are used).  The components must have the same number of digits. 
For hexadecimal values A to F, either upper or lower case are
acceptable.

   <p>The <kbd>M-x list-colors-display</kbd> command also shows the equivalent
RGB triplet for each named color.  For instance, `<samp><span class="samp">medium sea
green</span></samp>' is equivalent to `<samp><span class="samp">#3CB371</span></samp>'.

   <p><a name="index-face-colors_002c-setting-651"></a><a name="index-set_002dface_002dforeground-652"></a><a name="index-set_002dface_002dbackground-653"></a>  You can change the foreground and background colors of a face with
<kbd>M-x set-face-foreground</kbd> and <kbd>M-x set-face-background</kbd>. 
These commands prompt in the minibuffer for a face name and a color,
with completion, and then set that face to use the specified color. 
They affect the face colors on all frames, but their effects do not
persist for future Emacs sessions, unlike using the customization
buffer or X resources.  You can also use frame parameters to set
foreground and background colors for a specific frame; See <a href="#Frame-Parameters">Frame Parameters</a>.

<h3 class="section">14.10 Standard Faces</h3>

<p><a name="index-standard-faces-654"></a>
  Here are the standard faces for specifying text appearance.  You can
apply them to specific text when you want the effects they produce.

     <dl>
<dt><code>default</code><dd>This face is used for ordinary text that doesn't specify any face. 
Its background color is used as the frame's background color. 
<br><dt><code>bold</code><dd>This face uses a bold variant of the default font. 
<br><dt><code>italic</code><dd>This face uses an italic variant of the default font. 
<br><dt><code>bold-italic</code><dd>This face uses a bold italic variant of the default font. 
<br><dt><code>underline</code><dd>This face underlines text. 
<br><dt><code>fixed-pitch</code><dd>This face forces use of a fixed-width font.  It's reasonable to
customize this face to use a different fixed-width font, if you like,
but you should not make it a variable-width font. 
<a name="index-variable_002dpitch-face-655"></a><br><dt><code>variable-pitch</code><dd>This face forces use of a variable-width font. 
<a name="index-shadow-face-656"></a><br><dt><code>shadow</code><dd>This face is used for making the text less noticeable than the surrounding
ordinary text.  Usually this can be achieved by using shades of gray in
contrast with either black or white default foreground color. 
</dl>

   <p>Here's an incomplete list of faces used to highlight parts of the
text temporarily for specific purposes.  (Many other modes define
their own faces for this purpose.)

     <dl>
<dt><code>highlight</code><dd>This face is used for text highlighting in various contexts, such as
when the mouse cursor is moved over a hyperlink. 
<br><dt><code>isearch</code><dd>This face is used to highlight the current Isearch match
(see <a href="#Incremental-Search">Incremental Search</a>). 
<br><dt><code>query-replace</code><dd>This face is used to highlight the current Query Replace match
(see <a href="#Replace">Replace</a>). 
<br><dt><code>lazy-highlight</code><dd>This face is used to highlight lazy matches for Isearch and Query
Replace (matches other than the current one). 
<br><dt><code>region</code><dd>This face is used for displaying an active region (see <a href="#Mark">Mark</a>). 
When Emacs is built with GTK support, its colors are taken from the
current GTK theme. 
<br><dt><code>secondary-selection</code><dd>This face is used for displaying a secondary X selection (see <a href="#Secondary-Selection">Secondary Selection</a>). 
<br><dt><code>trailing-whitespace</code><dd>The face for highlighting excess spaces and tabs at the end of a line
when <code>show-trailing-whitespace</code> is non-<code>nil</code> (see <a href="#Useless-Whitespace">Useless Whitespace</a>). 
<br><dt><code>escape-glyph</code><dd>The face for displaying control characters and escape sequences
(see <a href="#Text-Display">Text Display</a>). 
<br><dt><code>nobreak-space</code><dd>The face for displaying no-break space characters (see <a href="#Text-Display">Text Display</a>). 
</dl>

   <p>The following faces control the appearance of parts of the Emacs
frame:

     <dl>
<dt><code>mode-line</code><dd><a name="index-mode_002dline-face-657"></a><a name="index-faces-for-mode-lines-658"></a>This face is used for the mode line of the currently selected window,
and for menu bars when toolkit menus are not used.  By default, it's
drawn with shadows for a raised effect on graphical displays, and
drawn as the inverse of the default face on non-windowed terminals. 
<br><dt><code>mode-line-inactive</code><dd><a name="index-mode_002dline_002dinactive-face-659"></a>Like <code>mode-line</code>, but used for mode lines of the windows other
than the selected one (if <code>mode-line-in-non-selected-windows</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>).  This face inherits from <code>mode-line</code>, so changes
in that face affect mode lines in all windows. 
<br><dt><code>mode-line-highlight</code><dd><a name="index-mode_002dline_002dhighlight-face-660"></a>Like <code>highlight</code>, but used for mouse-sensitive portions of text
on mode lines.  Such portions of text typically pop up tooltips
(see <a href="#Tooltips">Tooltips</a>) when the mouse pointer hovers above them. 
<br><dt><code>mode-line-buffer-id</code><dd><a name="index-mode_002dline_002dbuffer_002did-face-661"></a>This face is used for buffer identification parts in the mode line. 
<br><dt><code>header-line</code><dd><a name="index-header_002dline-face-662"></a>Similar to <code>mode-line</code> for a window's header line, which appears
at the top of a window just as the mode line appears at the bottom. 
Most windows do not have a header line&mdash;only some special modes, such
Info mode, create one. 
<br><dt><code>vertical-border</code><dd><a name="index-vertical_002dborder-face-663"></a>This face is used for the vertical divider between windows on text
terminals. 
<br><dt><code>minibuffer-prompt</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bminibuffer_002dprompt_007d-face-664"></a><a name="index-minibuffer_002dprompt_002dproperties-665"></a>This face is used for the prompt strings displayed in the minibuffer. 
By default, Emacs automatically adds this face to the value of
<code>minibuffer-prompt-properties</code>, which is a list of text
properties (see <a href="elisp.html#Text-Properties">Text Properties</a>) used to display the prompt text.  (This variable takes effect
when you enter the minibuffer.) 
<br><dt><code>fringe</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bfringe_007d-face-666"></a>The face for the fringes to the left and right of windows on graphic
displays.  (The fringes are the narrow portions of the Emacs frame
between the text area and the window's right and left borders.) 
See <a href="#Fringes">Fringes</a>. 
<br><dt><code>cursor</code><dd>The <code>:background</code> attribute of this face specifies the color of
the text cursor.  See <a href="#Cursor-Display">Cursor Display</a>. 
<br><dt><code>tooltip</code><dd>This face is used for tooltip text.  By default, if Emacs is built
with GTK support, tooltips are drawn via GTK and this face has no
effect.  See <a href="#Tooltips">Tooltips</a>. 
<br><dt><code>mouse</code><dd>This face determines the color of the mouse pointer. 
</dl>

   <p>The following faces likewise control the appearance of parts of the
Emacs frame, but only on text terminals, or when Emacs is built on X
with no toolkit support.  (For all other cases, the appearance of the
respective frame elements is determined by system-wide settings.)

     <dl>
<dt><code>scroll-bar</code><dd>This face determines the visual appearance of the scroll bar. 
See <a href="#Scroll-Bars">Scroll Bars</a>. 
<br><dt><code>tool-bar</code><dd>This face determines the color of tool bar icons.  See <a href="#Tool-Bars">Tool Bars</a>. 
<br><dt><code>menu</code><dd><a name="index-menu-bar-appearance-667"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bmenu_007d-face_002c-no-effect-if-customized-668"></a><a name="index-customization-of-_0040code_007bmenu_007d-face-669"></a>This face determines the colors and font of Emacs's menus.  See <a href="#Menu-Bars">Menu Bars</a>. 
<br><dt><code>tty-menu-enabled-face</code><dd><a name="index-faces-for-text_002dmode-menus-670"></a><a name="index-TTY-menu-faces-671"></a>This face is used to display enabled menu items on text-mode
terminals. 
<br><dt><code>tty-menu-disabled-face</code><dd>This face is used to display disabled menu items on text-mode
terminals. 
<br><dt><code>tty-menu-selected-face</code><dd>This face is used to display on text-mode terminals the menu item that
would be selected if you click a mouse or press &lt;RET&gt;.

type <kbd>C-x C-+</kbd> or <kbd>C-x C-=</kbd>.  To decrease it, type <kbd>C-x
C--</kbd>.  To restore the default (global) face height, type <kbd>C-x
C-0</kbd>.  These keys are all bound to the same command,
<code>text-scale-adjust</code>, which looks at the last key typed to
determine which action to take.

   <p>The final key of these commands may be repeated without the leading
<kbd>C-x</kbd>.  For instance, <kbd>C-x C-= C-= C-=</kbd> increases the face
height by three steps.  Each step scales the text height by a factor
of 1.2; to change this factor, customize the variable
<code>text-scale-mode-step</code>.  A numeric argument of 0
to the <code>text-scale-adjust</code> command restores the default height,
the same as typing <kbd>C-x C-0</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-increase-buffer-face-height-678"></a><a name="index-text_002dscale_002dincrease-679"></a><a name="index-decrease-buffer-face-height-680"></a><a name="index-text_002dscale_002ddecrease-681"></a>  The commands <code>text-scale-increase</code> and
<code>text-scale-decrease</code> increase or decrease the height of the
default face, just like <kbd>C-x C-+</kbd> and <kbd>C-x C--</kbd> respectively. 
You may find it convenient to bind to these commands, rather than
<code>text-scale-adjust</code>.

   <p><a name="index-set-buffer-face-height-682"></a><a name="index-text_002dscale_002dset-683"></a>  The command <code>text-scale-set</code> scales the height of the default
face in the current buffer to an absolute level specified by its
prefix argument.

   <p><a name="index-text_002dscale_002dmode-684"></a>  The above commands automatically enable the minor mode
<code>text-scale-mode</code> if the current font scaling is other than 1,
and disable it otherwise.

<h3 class="section">14.12 Font Lock mode</h3>

<p><a name="index-Font-Lock-mode-685"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Font-Lock-686"></a><a name="index-syntax-highlighting-and-coloring-687"></a>
  Font Lock mode is a minor mode, always local to a particular buffer,
which assigns faces to (or <dfn>fontifies</dfn>) the text in the buffer. 
Each buffer's major mode tells Font Lock mode which text to fontify;
for instance, programming language modes fontify syntactically
relevant constructs like comments, strings, and function names.

   <p><a name="index-font_002dlock_002dmode-688"></a>  Font Lock mode is enabled by default.  To toggle it in the current
buffer, type <kbd>M-x font-lock-mode</kbd>.  A positive numeric argument
unconditionally enables Font Lock mode, and a negative or zero
argument disables it.

   <p><a name="index-global_002dfont_002dlock_002dmode-689"></a><a name="index-global_002dfont_002dlock_002dmode-690"></a>  Type <kbd>M-x global-font-lock-mode</kbd> to toggle Font Lock mode in all
buffers.  To impose this setting for future Emacs sessions, customize
the variable <code>global-font-lock-mode</code> (see <a href="#Easy-Customization">Easy Customization</a>), or add the following line to your init file:

<pre class="example">     (global-font-lock-mode 0)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If you have disabled Global Font Lock mode, you can still enable Font
Lock for specific major modes by adding the function
<code>font-lock-mode</code> to the mode hooks (see <a href="#Hooks">Hooks</a>).  For example,
to enable Font Lock mode for editing C files, you can do this:

<pre class="example">     (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'font-lock-mode)
</pre>
   <p>Font Lock mode uses several specifically named faces to do its job,
including <code>font-lock-string-face</code>, <code>font-lock-comment-face</code>,
and others.  The easiest way to find them all is to use <kbd>M-x
customize-group &lt;RET&gt; font-lock-faces &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.  You can then
use that customization buffer to customize the appearance of these
faces.  See <a href="#Face-Customization">Face Customization</a>.

   <p><a name="index-font_002dlock_002dmaximum_002ddecoration-691"></a>  You can customize the variable <code>font-lock-maximum-decoration</code>
to alter the amount of fontification applied by Font Lock mode, for
major modes that support this feature.  The value should be a number
(with 1 representing a minimal amount of fontification; some modes
support levels as high as 3); or <code>t</code>, meaning &ldquo;as high as
possible&rdquo; (the default).  You can also specify different numbers for
particular major modes; for example, to use level 1 for C/C++ modes,
and the default level otherwise, use the value

<pre class="example">     '((c-mode . 1) (c++-mode . 1)))
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-incorrect-fontification-692"></a><a name="index-parenthesis-in-column-zero-and-fontification-693"></a><a name="index-brace-in-column-zero-and-fontification-694"></a>  Comment and string fontification (or &ldquo;syntactic&rdquo; fontification)
relies on analysis of the syntactic structure of the buffer text.  For
the sake of speed, some modes, including Lisp mode, rely on a special
convention: an open-parenthesis or open-brace in the leftmost column
always defines the beginning of a defun, and is thus always outside
any string or comment.  Therefore, you should avoid placing an
open-parenthesis or open-brace in the leftmost column, if it is inside
a string or comment.  See <a href="#Left-Margin-Paren">Left Margin Paren</a>, for details.

   <p><a name="index-font_002dlock_002dadd_002dkeywords-695"></a>  Font Lock highlighting patterns already exist for most modes, but
you may want to fontify additional patterns.  You can use the function
<code>font-lock-add-keywords</code>, to add your own highlighting patterns
for a particular mode.  For example, to highlight `<samp><span class="samp">FIXME:</span></samp>' words
in C comments, use this:

<pre class="example">     (add-hook 'c-mode-hook
               (lambda ()
                (font-lock-add-keywords nil
                 '(("\\&lt;\\(FIXME\\):" 1
                    font-lock-warning-face t)))))
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-font_002dlock_002dremove_002dkeywords-696"></a>To remove keywords from the font-lock highlighting patterns, use the
function <code>font-lock-remove-keywords</code>.  See <a href="elisp.html#Search_002dbased-Fontification">Search-based Fontification</a>.

   <p><a name="index-just_002din_002dtime-_0028JIT_0029-font_002dlock-697"></a><a name="index-background-syntax-highlighting-698"></a>  Fontifying large buffers can take a long time.  To avoid large
delays when a file is visited, Emacs initially fontifies only the
visible portion of a buffer.  As you scroll through the buffer, each
portion that becomes visible is fontified as soon as it is displayed;
this type of Font Lock is called <dfn>Just-In-Time</dfn> (or <dfn>JIT</dfn>)
Lock.  You can control how JIT Lock behaves, including telling it to
perform fontification while idle, by customizing variables in the
customization group `<samp><span class="samp">jit-lock</span></samp>'.  See <a href="#Specific-Customization">Specific Customization</a>.

<h3 class="section">14.13 Interactive Highlighting</h3>

<p><a name="index-highlighting-by-matching-699"></a><a name="index-interactive-highlighting-700"></a><a name="index-Highlight-Changes-mode-701"></a>
<a name="index-highlight_002dchanges_002dmode-702"></a>Highlight Changes mode is a minor mode that <dfn>highlights</dfn> the parts
of the buffer that were changed most recently, by giving that text a
different face.  To enable or disable Highlight Changes mode, use
<kbd>M-x highlight-changes-mode</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-Hi-Lock-mode-703"></a><a name="index-hi_002dlock_002dmode-704"></a>  Hi Lock mode is a minor mode that highlights text that matches
regular expressions you specify.  For example, you can use it to
highlight all the references to a certain variable in a program source
file, highlight certain parts in a voluminous output of some program,
or highlight certain names in an article.  To enable or disable Hi
Lock mode, use the command <kbd>M-x hi-lock-mode</kbd>.  To enable Hi Lock
mode for all buffers, use <kbd>M-x global-hi-lock-mode</kbd> or place
<code>(global-hi-lock-mode 1)</code> in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file.

   <p>Hi Lock mode works like Font Lock mode (see <a href="#Font-Lock">Font Lock</a>), except
that you specify explicitly the regular expressions to highlight.  You
control them with the commands described below.  (The key bindings
below that begin with <kbd>C-x w</kbd> are deprecated in favor of the
global <kbd>M-s h</kbd> bindings, and will be removed in some future Emacs
version.)

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-s h r </kbd><var>regexp</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>face</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dt><kbd>C-x w h </kbd><var>regexp</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>face</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-M_002ds-h-r-705"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-w-h-706"></a><a name="index-highlight_002dregexp-707"></a>Highlight text that matches <var>regexp</var> using face <var>face</var>
(<code>highlight-regexp</code>).  The highlighting will remain as long as
the buffer is loaded.  For example, to highlight all occurrences of
the word &ldquo;whim&rdquo; using the default face (a yellow background)
<kbd>M-s h r whim &lt;RET&gt; &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.  Any face can be used for
highlighting, Hi Lock provides several of its own and these are
pre-loaded into a list of default values.  While being prompted
for a face use <kbd>M-n</kbd> and <kbd>M-p</kbd> to cycle through them.

     <p><a name="index-hi_002dlock_002dauto_002dselect_002dface-708"></a>Setting the option <code>hi-lock-auto-select-face</code> to a non-<code>nil</code>
value causes this command (and other Hi Lock commands that read faces)
to automatically choose the next face from the default list without
prompting.

     <p>You can use this command multiple times, specifying various regular
expressions to highlight in different ways.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-s h u </kbd><var>regexp</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dt><kbd>C-x w r </kbd><var>regexp</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-M_002ds-h-u-709"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-w-r-710"></a><a name="index-unhighlight_002dregexp-711"></a>Unhighlight <var>regexp</var> (<code>unhighlight-regexp</code>).

     <p>If you invoke this from the menu, you select the expression to
unhighlight from a list.  If you invoke this from the keyboard, you
use the minibuffer.  It will show the most recently added regular
expression; use <kbd>M-n</kbd> to show the next older expression and
<kbd>M-p</kbd> to select the next newer expression.  (You can also type the
expression by hand, with completion.)  When the expression you want to
unhighlight appears in the minibuffer, press <kbd>&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> to exit
the minibuffer and unhighlight it.

     <p>These patterns are extracted from the comments, if appropriate, if you
invoke <kbd>M-x hi-lock-find-patterns</kbd>, or if you visit the file while
Hi Lock mode is enabled (since that runs <code>hi-lock-find-patterns</code>).

(<code>hi-lock-find-patterns</code>).  Thus, you can enter patterns
interactively with <code>highlight-regexp</code>, store them into the file
with <code>hi-lock-write-interactive-patterns</code>, edit them (perhaps
including different faces for different parenthesized parts of the
match), and finally use this command (<code>hi-lock-find-patterns</code>) to
have Hi Lock highlight the edited patterns.

     <p><a name="index-hi_002dlock_002dfile_002dpatterns_002dpolicy-733"></a>The variable <code>hi-lock-file-patterns-policy</code> controls whether Hi

<code>ask</code> (query the user), or a function.  If it is a function,
<code>hi-lock-find-patterns</code> calls it with the patterns as argument; if
the function returns non-<code>nil</code>, the patterns are used.  The default
is <code>ask</code>.  Note that patterns are always highlighted if you call
<code>hi-lock-find-patterns</code> directly, regardless of the value of this
variable.

     <p><a name="index-hi_002dlock_002dexclude_002dmodes-734"></a>Also, <code>hi-lock-find-patterns</code> does nothing if the current major

<h3 class="section">14.14 Window Fringes</h3>

<p><a name="index-fringes-735"></a>
<a name="index-set_002dfringe_002dstyle-736"></a><a name="index-fringe_002dmode-737"></a><a name="index-fringe_002dmode-_0040r_007b_0028variable_0029_007d-738"></a>  On graphical displays, each Emacs window normally has narrow
<dfn>fringes</dfn> on the left and right edges.  The fringes are used to
display symbols that provide information about the text in the window. 
You can type <kbd>M-x fringe-mode</kbd> to disable the fringes, or modify
their width.  This command affects fringes in all frames; to modify
fringes on the selected frame only, use <kbd>M-x set-fringe-style</kbd>. 
You can make your changes to the fringes permanent by customizing the
variable <code>fringe-mode</code>.

   <p>The most common use of the fringes is to indicate a continuation
line (see <a href="#Continuation-Lines">Continuation Lines</a>).  When one line of text is split
into multiple screen lines, the left fringe shows a curving arrow for
each screen line except the first, indicating that this is not the
real beginning.  The right fringe shows a curving arrow for each
screen line except the last, indicating that this is not the real
end.  If the line's direction is right-to-left (see <a href="#Bidirectional-Editing">Bidirectional Editing</a>), the meanings of the curving arrows in the fringes are
swapped.

   <p>The fringes indicate line truncation (see <a href="#Line-Truncation">Line Truncation</a>) with
short horizontal arrows meaning there's more text on this line which
is scrolled horizontally out of view.  Clicking the mouse on one of
the arrows scrolls the display horizontally in the direction of the
arrow.

   <p>The fringes can also indicate other things, such as buffer
boundaries (see <a href="#Displaying-Boundaries">Displaying Boundaries</a>), and where a program you
are debugging is executing (see <a href="#Debuggers">Debuggers</a>).

   <p><a name="index-overflow_002dnewline_002dinto_002dfringe-739"></a>  The fringe is also used for drawing the cursor, if the current line
is exactly as wide as the window and point is at the end of the line. 
To disable this, change the variable
<code>overflow-newline-into-fringe</code> to <code>nil</code>; this causes Emacs
to continue or truncate lines that are exactly as wide as the window.

   <p>If you customize <code>fringe-mode</code> to remove the fringes on one or
both sides of the window display, the features that display on the
fringe are not available.  Indicators of line continuation and
truncation are an exception: when fringes are not available, Emacs
uses the leftmost and rightmost character cells to indicate
continuation and truncation with special ASCII characters, see
<a href="#Continuation-Lines">Continuation Lines</a>, and <a href="#Line-Truncation">Line Truncation</a>.  This reduces the
width available for displaying text on each line, because the
character cells used for truncation and continuation indicators are
reserved for that purpose.  Since buffer text can include
bidirectional text, and thus both left-to-right and right-to-left
paragraphs (see <a href="#Bidirectional-Editing">Bidirectional Editing</a>), removing only one of the
fringes still reserves two character cells, one on each side of the
window, for truncation and continuation indicators, because these
indicators are displayed on opposite sides of the window in
right-to-left paragraphs.

<h3 class="section">14.15 Displaying Boundaries</h3>

<p><a name="index-indicate_002dbuffer_002dboundaries-740"></a>  On graphical displays, Emacs can indicate the buffer boundaries in
the fringes.  If you enable this feature, the first line and the last
line are marked with angle images in the fringes.  This can be
combined with up and down arrow images which say whether it is
possible to scroll the window.

   <p>The buffer-local variable <code>indicate-buffer-boundaries</code> controls
how the buffer boundaries and window scrolling is indicated in the
fringes.  If the value is <code>left</code> or <code>right</code>, both angle and
arrow bitmaps are displayed in the left or right fringe, respectively.

   <p>If value is an alist (see <a href="elisp.html#Association-Lists">Association Lists</a>), each element <code>(</code><var>indicator</var><code> . 
</code><var>position</var><code>)</code> specifies the position of one of the indicators.  The
<var>indicator</var> must be one of <code>top</code>, <code>bottom</code>, <code>up</code>,
<code>down</code>, or <code>t</code> which specifies the default position for the
indicators not present in the alist.  The <var>position</var> is one of
<code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, or <code>nil</code> which specifies not to show
this indicator.

   <p>For example, <code>((top . left) (t . right))</code> places the top angle
bitmap in left fringe, the bottom angle bitmap in right fringe, and
both arrow bitmaps in right fringe.  To show just the angle bitmaps in
the left fringe, but no arrow bitmaps, use <code>((top .  left)
(bottom . left))</code>.

<h3 class="section">14.16 Useless Whitespace</h3>

<p><a name="index-trailing-whitespace-741"></a><a name="index-whitespace_002c-trailing-742"></a><a name="index-show_002dtrailing_002dwhitespace-743"></a>  It is easy to leave unnecessary spaces at the end of a line, or
empty lines at the end of a buffer, without realizing it.  In most
cases, this <dfn>trailing whitespace</dfn> has no effect, but sometimes it
can be a nuisance.

   <p><a name="index-trailing_002dwhitespace-face-744"></a>  You can make trailing whitespace at the end of a line visible by
setting the buffer-local variable <code>show-trailing-whitespace</code> to
<code>t</code>.  Then Emacs displays trailing whitespace, using the face
<code>trailing-whitespace</code>.

   <p>This feature does not apply when point is at the end of the line
containing the whitespace.  Strictly speaking, that is trailing
whitespace nonetheless, but displaying it specially in that case
looks ugly while you are typing in new text.  In this special case,
the location of point is enough to show you that the spaces are
present.

   <p><a name="index-delete_002dtrailing_002dwhitespace-745"></a><a name="index-delete_002dtrailing_002dlines-746"></a>  Type <kbd>M-x delete-trailing-whitespace</kbd> to delete all trailing
whitespace.  This command deletes all extra spaces at the end of each
line in the buffer, and all empty lines at the end of the buffer; to
ignore the latter, change the variable <code>delete-trailing-lines</code> to
<code>nil</code>.  If the region is active, the command instead deletes
extra spaces at the end of each line in the region.

   <p><a name="index-indicate_002dempty_002dlines-747"></a><a name="index-unused-lines-748"></a><a name="index-fringes_002c-and-unused-line-indication-749"></a>  On graphical displays, Emacs can indicate unused lines at the end of
the window with a small image in the left fringe (see <a href="#Fringes">Fringes</a>). 
The image appears for screen lines that do not correspond to any
buffer text, so blank lines at the end of the buffer stand out because
they lack this image.  To enable this feature, set the buffer-local
variable <code>indicate-empty-lines</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> value.  You
can enable or disable this feature for all new buffers by setting the
default value of this variable, e.g., <code>(setq-default
indicate-empty-lines t)</code>.

   <p><a name="index-Whitespace-mode-750"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Whitespace-751"></a><a name="index-whitespace_002dmode-752"></a><a name="index-whitespace_002dstyle-753"></a><a name="index-whitespace_002dtoggle_002doptions-754"></a>  Whitespace mode is a buffer-local minor mode that lets you
visualize many kinds of whitespace in the buffer, by either
drawing the whitespace characters with a special face or displaying
them as special glyphs.  To toggle this mode, type <kbd>M-x
whitespace-mode</kbd>.  The kinds of whitespace visualized are determined
by the list variable <code>whitespace-style</code>.  Individual elements in
that list can be toggled on or off in the current buffer by typing
<kbd>M-x&nbsp;whitespace-toggle-options</kbd><!-- /@w -->.  Here is a partial list
of possible elements (see the variable's documentation for the full
list):

     <dl>
<dt><code>face</code><dd>Enable all visualizations which use special faces.  This element has a
special meaning: if it is absent from the list, none of the other
visualizations take effect except <code>space-mark</code>, <code>tab-mark</code>,
and <code>newline-mark</code>.

     <br><dt><code>trailing</code><dd>Highlight trailing whitespace.

     <br><dt><code>tabs</code><dd>Highlight tab characters.

     <br><dt><code>spaces</code><dd>Highlight space and non-breaking space characters.

     <br><dt><code>lines</code><dd><a name="index-whitespace_002dline_002dcolumn-755"></a>Highlight lines longer than 80 columns.  To change the column limit,
customize the variable <code>whitespace-line-column</code>.

     <br><dt><code>newline</code><dd>Highlight newlines.

     <br><dt><code>empty</code><dd>Highlight empty lines.

     <br><dt><code>big-indent</code><dd><a name="index-whitespace_002dbig_002dindent_002dregexp-756"></a>Highlight too-deep indentation.  By default any sequence of at least 4
consecutive TAB characters or 32 consecutive SPC characters is
highlighted.  To change that, customize the regular expression
<code>whitespace-big-indent-regexp</code>.

     <br><dt><code>space-mark</code><dd>Draw space and non-breaking characters with a special glyph.

     <br><dt><code>tab-mark</code><dd>Draw tab characters with a special glyph.

  Emacs has the ability to hide lines indented more than a given
number of columns.  You can use this to get an overview of a part of a
program.

   <p>To hide lines in the current buffer, type <kbd>C-x $</kbd>
(<code>set-selective-display</code>) with a numeric argument <var>n</var>.  Then
lines with at least <var>n</var> columns of indentation disappear from the
screen.  The only indication of their presence is that three dots
(`<samp><span class="samp">...</span></samp>') appear at the end of each visible line that is
followed by one or more hidden ones.

   <p>The commands <kbd>C-n</kbd> and <kbd>C-p</kbd> move across the hidden lines as
if they were not there.

   <p>The hidden lines are still present in the buffer, and most editing
commands see them as usual, so you may find point in the middle of the
hidden text.  When this happens, the cursor appears at the end of the
previous line, after the three dots.  If point is at the end of the
visible line, before the newline that ends it, the cursor appears before
the three dots.

   <p>To make all lines visible again, type <kbd>C-x $</kbd> with no argument.

   <p><a name="index-selective_002ddisplay_002dellipses-762"></a>  If you set the variable <code>selective-display-ellipses</code> to
<code>nil</code>, the three dots do not appear at the end of a line that
precedes hidden lines.  Then there is no visible indication of the
hidden lines.  This variable becomes local automatically when set.

   <p>See also <a href="#Outline-Mode">Outline Mode</a> for another way to hide part of
the text in a buffer.

buffer above the top of the window.  You can additionally display the
size of the buffer by typing <kbd>M-x size-indication-mode</kbd> to turn on
Size Indication mode.  The size will be displayed immediately
following the buffer percentage like this:

<pre class="example">     <var>pos</var> of <var>size</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here <var>size</var> is the human readable representation of the number of
characters in the buffer, which means that `<samp><span class="samp">k</span></samp>' for 10^3, `<samp><span class="samp">M</span></samp>'
for 10^6, `<samp><span class="samp">G</span></samp>' for 10^9, etc., are used to abbreviate.

   <p><a name="index-line-number-display-766"></a><a name="index-display-of-line-number-767"></a><a name="index-line_002dnumber_002dmode-768"></a>  The current line number of point appears in the mode line when Line
Number mode is enabled.  Use the command <kbd>M-x line-number-mode</kbd> to
turn this mode on and off; normally it is on.  The line number appears
after the buffer percentage <var>pos</var>, with the letter `<samp><span class="samp">L</span></samp>' to
indicate what it is.

   <p><a name="index-Column-Number-mode-769"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Column-Number-770"></a><a name="index-column_002dnumber_002dmode-771"></a>  Similarly, you can display the current column number by turning on
Column number mode with <kbd>M-x column-number-mode</kbd>.  The column
number is indicated by the letter `<samp><span class="samp">C</span></samp>'.  However, when both of
these modes are enabled, the line and column numbers are displayed in
parentheses, the line number first, rather than with `<samp><span class="samp">L</span></samp>' and
`<samp><span class="samp">C</span></samp>'.  For example: `<samp><span class="samp">(561,2)</span></samp>'.  See <a href="#Minor-Modes">Minor Modes</a>, for more
information about minor modes and about how to use these commands.

   <p><a name="index-narrowing_002c-and-line-number-display-772"></a>  If you have narrowed the buffer (see <a href="#Narrowing">Narrowing</a>), the displayed
line number is relative to the accessible portion of the buffer. 
Thus, it isn't suitable as an argument to <code>goto-line</code>.  (Use
<code>what-line</code> command to see the line number relative to the whole
file.)

   <p><a name="index-line_002dnumber_002ddisplay_002dlimit-773"></a>  If the buffer is very large (larger than the value of
<code>line-number-display-limit</code>), Emacs won't compute the line
number, because that would be too slow; therefore, the line number
won't appear on the mode-line.  To remove this limit, set
<code>line-number-display-limit</code> to <code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-line_002dnumber_002ddisplay_002dlimit_002dwidth-774"></a>  Line-number computation can also be slow if the lines in the buffer
are too long.  For this reason, Emacs doesn't display line numbers if
the average width, in characters, of lines near point is larger than
the value of <code>line-number-display-limit-width</code>.  The default
value is 200 characters.

   <p><a name="index-display_002dtime-775"></a><a name="index-time-_0028on-mode-line_0029-776"></a>  Emacs can optionally display the time and system load in all mode
lines.  To enable this feature, type <kbd>M-x display-time</kbd> or customize
the option <code>display-time-mode</code>.  The information added to the mode
line looks like this:

<pre class="example">     <var>hh</var>:<var>mm</var>pm <var>l.ll</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><a name="index-display_002dtime_002d24hr_002dformat-777"></a>Here <var>hh</var> and <var>mm</var> are the hour and minute, followed always by
`<samp><span class="samp">am</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">pm</span></samp>'.  <var>l.ll</var> is the average number, collected
for the last few minutes, of processes in the whole system that were
either running or ready to run (i.e., were waiting for an available
processor).  (Some fields may be missing if your operating system
cannot support them.)  If you prefer time display in 24-hour format,
set the variable <code>display-time-24hr-format</code> to <code>t</code>.

   <p><a name="index-mail-_0028on-mode-line_0029-778"></a><a name="index-display_002dtime_002duse_002dmail_002dicon-779"></a><a name="index-display_002dtime_002dmail_002dface-780"></a><a name="index-display_002dtime_002dmail_002dfile-781"></a><a name="index-display_002dtime_002dmail_002ddirectory-782"></a>  The word `<samp><span class="samp">Mail</span></samp>' appears after the load level if there is mail
for you that you have not read yet.  On graphical displays, you can
use an icon instead of `<samp><span class="samp">Mail</span></samp>' by customizing
<code>display-time-use-mail-icon</code>; this may save some space on the
mode line.  You can customize <code>display-time-mail-face</code> to make
the mail indicator prominent.  Use <code>display-time-mail-file</code> to
specify the mail file to check, or set
<code>display-time-mail-directory</code> to specify the directory to check
for incoming mail (any nonempty regular file in the directory is
considered to be newly arrived mail).

   <p><a name="index-battery-status-_0028on-mode-line_0029-783"></a><a name="index-display_002dbattery_002dmode-784"></a><a name="index-display_002dbattery_002dmode-785"></a><a name="index-battery_002dmode_002dline_002dformat-786"></a>  When running Emacs on a laptop computer, you can display the battery
charge on the mode-line, by using the command
<code>display-battery-mode</code> or customizing the variable
<code>display-battery-mode</code>.  The variable
<code>battery-mode-line-format</code> determines the way the battery charge
is displayed; the exact mode-line message depends on the operating
system, and it usually shows the current battery charge as a
percentage of the total charge.

   <p><a name="index-mode-line_002c-3D-appearance-787"></a><a name="index-attributes-of-mode-line_002c-changing-788"></a><a name="index-non_002dintegral-number-of-lines-in-a-window-789"></a>  On graphical displays, the mode line is drawn as a 3D box.  If you
don't like this effect, you can disable it by customizing the
<code>mode-line</code> face and setting its <code>box</code> attribute to
<code>nil</code>.  See <a href="#Face-Customization">Face Customization</a>.

   <p><a name="index-non_002dselected-windows_002c-mode-line-appearance-790"></a>  By default, the mode line of nonselected windows is displayed in a
different face, called <code>mode-line-inactive</code>.  Only the selected
window is displayed in the <code>mode-line</code> face.  This helps show
which window is selected.  When the minibuffer is selected, since
it has no mode line, the window from which you activated the minibuffer
has its mode line displayed using <code>mode-line</code>; as a result,
ordinary entry to the minibuffer does not change any mode lines.

   <p><a name="index-mode_002dline_002din_002dnon_002dselected_002dwindows-791"></a>  You can disable use of <code>mode-line-inactive</code> by setting variable
<code>mode-line-in-non-selected-windows</code> to <code>nil</code>; then all mode
lines are displayed in the <code>mode-line</code> face.

formats by setting each of the variables <code>eol-mnemonic-unix</code>,
<code>eol-mnemonic-dos</code>, <code>eol-mnemonic-mac</code>, and
<code>eol-mnemonic-undecided</code> to the strings you prefer.

<h3 class="section">14.19 How Text Is Displayed</h3>

<p><a name="index-characters-_0028in-text_0029-796"></a><a name="index-printing-character-797"></a>
  Most characters are <dfn>printing characters</dfn>: when they appear in a
buffer, they are displayed literally on the screen.  Printing
characters include <acronym>ASCII</acronym> numbers, letters, and punctuation
characters, as well as many non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters.

   <p><a name="index-tab_002dwidth-798"></a><a name="index-control-characters-on-display-799"></a>  The <acronym>ASCII</acronym> character set contains non-printing <dfn>control
characters</dfn>.  Two of these are displayed specially: the newline
character (Unicode code point <code>U+000A</code>) is displayed by starting
a new line, while the tab character (<code>U+0009</code>) is displayed as a
space that extends to the next tab stop column (normally every 8
columns).  The number of spaces per tab is controlled by the
buffer-local variable <code>tab-width</code>, which must have an integer
value between 1 and 1000, inclusive.  Note that how the tab character
in the buffer is displayed has nothing to do with the definition of
&lt;TAB&gt; as a command.

   <p>Other <acronym>ASCII</acronym> control characters, whose codes are below
<code>U+0020</code> (octal 40, decimal 32), are displayed as a caret
(`<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>') followed by the non-control version of the character, with
the <code>escape-glyph</code> face.  For instance, the `<samp><span class="samp">control-A</span></samp>'
character, <code>U+0001</code>, is displayed as `<samp><span class="samp">^A</span></samp>'.

   <p><a name="index-octal-escapes-800"></a><a name="index-ctl_002darrow-801"></a>  The raw bytes with codes <code>U+0080</code> (octal 200) through
<code>U+009F</code> (octal 237) are displayed as <dfn>octal escape
sequences</dfn>, with the <code>escape-glyph</code> face.  For instance,
character code <code>U+0098</code> (octal 230) is displayed as `<samp><span class="samp">\230</span></samp>'. 
If you change the buffer-local variable <code>ctl-arrow</code> to
<code>nil</code>, the <acronym>ASCII</acronym> control characters are also displayed
as octal escape sequences instead of caret escape sequences.

   <p><a name="index-nobreak_002dchar_002ddisplay-802"></a><a name="index-non_002dbreaking-space-803"></a><a name="index-non_002dbreaking-hyphen-804"></a><a name="index-soft-hyphen-805"></a><a name="index-escape_002dglyph-face-806"></a><a name="index-nobreak_002dspace-face-807"></a>  Some non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters have the same appearance as an
<acronym>ASCII</acronym> space or hyphen (minus) character.  Such characters
can cause problems if they are entered into a buffer without your
realization, e.g., by yanking; for instance, source code compilers
typically do not treat non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> spaces as whitespace
characters.  To deal with this problem, Emacs displays such characters
specially: it displays <code>U+00A0</code> (no-break space) with the
<code>nobreak-space</code> face, and it displays <code>U+00AD</code> (soft
hyphen), <code>U+2010</code> (hyphen), and <code>U+2011</code> (non-breaking
hyphen) with the <code>escape-glyph</code> face.  To disable this, change
the variable <code>nobreak-char-display</code> to <code>nil</code>.  If you give
this variable a non-<code>nil</code> and non-<code>t</code> value, Emacs instead
displays such characters as a highlighted backslash followed by a
space or hyphen.

   <p>You can customize the way any particular character code is displayed
by means of a display table.  See <a href="elisp.html#Display-Tables">Display Tables</a>.

   <p><a name="index-glyphless-characters-808"></a><a name="index-characters-with-no-font-glyphs-809"></a><a name="index-glyphless_002dchar-face-810"></a>  On graphical displays, some characters may have no glyphs in any of
the fonts available to Emacs.  These <dfn>glyphless characters</dfn> are
normally displayed as boxes containing the hexadecimal character code. 
Similarly, on text terminals, characters that cannot be displayed
using the terminal encoding (see <a href="#Terminal-Coding">Terminal Coding</a>) are normally
displayed as question signs.  You can control the display method by
customizing the variable <code>glyphless-char-display-control</code>.  You
can also customize the <code>glyphless-char</code> face to make these

<h3 class="section">14.20 Displaying the Cursor</h3>

<p><a name="index-text-cursor-814"></a>
<a name="index-visible_002dcursor-815"></a>  On a text terminal, the cursor's appearance is controlled by the
terminal, largely out of the control of Emacs.  Some terminals offer
two different cursors: a visible static cursor, and a very
visible blinking cursor.  By default, Emacs uses the very visible
cursor, and switches to it when you start or resume Emacs.  If the
variable <code>visible-cursor</code> is <code>nil</code> when Emacs starts or
resumes, it uses the normal cursor.

   <p><a name="index-cursor-face-816"></a><a name="index-cursor_002dtype-817"></a>  On a graphical display, many more properties of the text cursor can
be altered.  To customize its color, change the <code>:background</code>
attribute of the face named <code>cursor</code> (see <a href="#Face-Customization">Face Customization</a>).  (The other attributes of this face have no effect;
the text shown under the cursor is drawn using the frame's background
color.)  To change its shape, customize the buffer-local variable
<code>cursor-type</code>; possible values are <code>box</code> (the default),
<code>hollow</code> (a hollow box), <code>bar</code> (a vertical bar), <code>(bar
. </code><var>n</var><code>)</code> (a vertical bar <var>n</var> pixels wide), <code>hbar</code> (a
horizontal bar), <code>(hbar . </code><var>n</var><code>)</code> (a horizontal bar <var>n</var>
pixels tall), or <code>nil</code> (no cursor at all).

   <p><a name="index-blink_002dcursor_002dmode-818"></a><a name="index-cursor_002c-blinking-819"></a><a name="index-blinking-cursor-820"></a><a name="index-blink_002dcursor_002dmode-821"></a><a name="index-blink_002dcursor_002dblinks-822"></a><a name="index-blink_002dcursor_002dalist-823"></a>  By default, the cursor stops blinking after 10 blinks, if Emacs does
not get any input during that time; any input event restarts the
count.  You can customize the variable <code>blink-cursor-blinks</code> to
control that: its value says how many times to blink without input
before stopping.  Setting that variable to a zero or negative value
will make the cursor blink forever.  To disable cursor blinking
altogether, change the variable <code>blink-cursor-mode</code> to <code>nil</code>
(see <a href="#Easy-Customization">Easy Customization</a>), or add the line

<pre class="lisp">       (blink-cursor-mode 0)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">to your init file.  Alternatively, you can change how the cursor
looks when it blinks off by customizing the list variable
<code>blink-cursor-alist</code>.  Each element in the list should have the
form <code>(</code><var>on-type</var><code> . </code><var>off-type</var><code>)</code>; this means that if the
cursor is displayed as <var>on-type</var> when it blinks on (where
<var>on-type</var> is one of the cursor types described above), then it is
displayed as <var>off-type</var> when it blinks off.

   <p><a name="index-x_002dstretch_002dcursor-824"></a><a name="index-wide-block-cursor-825"></a>  Some characters, such as tab characters, are extra wide.  When
the cursor is positioned over such a character, it is normally drawn
with the default character width.  You can make the cursor stretch to
cover wide characters, by changing the variable
<code>x-stretch-cursor</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> value.

   <p><a name="index-cursor-in-non_002dselected-windows-826"></a><a name="index-cursor_002din_002dnon_002dselected_002dwindows-827"></a>  The cursor normally appears in non-selected windows as a
non-blinking hollow box.  (For a bar cursor, it instead appears as a
thinner bar.)  To turn off cursors in non-selected windows, change the
variable <code>cursor-in-non-selected-windows</code> to <code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-hl_002dline_002dmode-828"></a><a name="index-global_002dhl_002dline_002dmode-829"></a><a name="index-highlight-current-line-830"></a>  To make the cursor even more visible, you can use HL Line mode, a
minor mode that highlights the line containing point.  Use <kbd>M-x
hl-line-mode</kbd> to enable or disable it in the current buffer.  <kbd>M-x
global-hl-line-mode</kbd> enables or disables the same mode globally.

<h3 class="section">14.21 Line Truncation</h3>

<p><a name="index-truncation-831"></a><a name="index-line-truncation_002c-and-fringes-832"></a>  As an alternative to continuation (see <a href="#Continuation-Lines">Continuation Lines</a>),
Emacs can display long lines by <dfn>truncation</dfn>.  This means that all
the characters that do not fit in the width of the screen or window do
not appear at all.  On graphical displays, a small straight arrow in
the fringe indicates truncation at either end of the line.  On text
terminals, this is indicated with `<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>' signs in the leftmost
and/or rightmost columns.

   <p><a name="index-truncate_002dlines-833"></a><a name="index-toggle_002dtruncate_002dlines-834"></a>  Horizontal scrolling automatically causes line truncation
(see <a href="#Horizontal-Scrolling">Horizontal Scrolling</a>).  You can explicitly enable line
truncation for a particular buffer with the command <kbd>M-x
toggle-truncate-lines</kbd>.  This works by locally changing the variable
<code>truncate-lines</code>.  If that variable is non-<code>nil</code>, long lines
are truncated; if it is <code>nil</code>, they are continued onto multiple
screen lines.  Setting the variable <code>truncate-lines</code> in any way
makes it local to the current buffer; until that time, the default
value, which is normally <code>nil</code>, is in effect.

   <p>If a split window becomes too narrow, Emacs may automatically enable
line truncation.  See <a href="#Split-Window">Split Window</a>, for the variable
<code>truncate-partial-width-windows</code> which controls this.

<h3 class="section">14.22 Visual Line Mode</h3>

<p><a name="index-word-wrap-835"></a>  Another alternative to ordinary line continuation is to use
<dfn>word wrap</dfn>.  Here, each long logical line is divided into two or
more screen lines, like in ordinary line continuation.  However, Emacs
attempts to wrap the line at word boundaries near the right window
edge.  This makes the text easier to read, as wrapping does not occur
in the middle of words.

   <p><a name="index-mode_002c-Visual-Line-836"></a><a name="index-Visual-Line-mode-837"></a><a name="index-visual_002dline_002dmode-838"></a><a name="index-global_002dvisual_002dline_002dmode-839"></a>  Word wrap is enabled by Visual Line mode, an optional minor mode. 
To turn on Visual Line mode in the current buffer, type <kbd>M-x
visual-line-mode</kbd>; repeating this command turns it off.  You can also
turn on Visual Line mode using the menu bar: in the Options menu,
select the `<samp><span class="samp">Line Wrapping in this Buffer</span></samp>' submenu, followed by
the `<samp><span class="samp">Word Wrap (Visual Line Mode)</span></samp>' menu item.  While Visual Line
mode is enabled, the mode-line shows the string `<samp><span class="samp">wrap</span></samp>' in the
mode display.  The command <kbd>M-x global-visual-line-mode</kbd> toggles
Visual Line mode in all buffers.

   <p><a name="index-beginning_002dof_002dvisual_002dline-840"></a><a name="index-end_002dof_002dvisual_002dline-841"></a><a name="index-next_002dlogical_002dline-842"></a><a name="index-previous_002dlogical_002dline-843"></a>  In Visual Line mode, some editing commands work on screen lines
instead of logical lines: <kbd>C-a</kbd> (<code>beginning-of-visual-line</code>)
moves to the beginning of the screen line, <kbd>C-e</kbd>
(<code>end-of-visual-line</code>) moves to the end of the screen line, and
<kbd>C-k</kbd> (<code>kill-visual-line</code>) kills text to the end of the
screen line.

   <p>To move by logical lines, use the commands <kbd>M-x
next-logical-line</kbd> and <kbd>M-x previous-logical-line</kbd>.  These move
point to the next logical line and the previous logical line
respectively, regardless of whether Visual Line mode is enabled.  If
you use these commands frequently, it may be convenient to assign key
bindings to them.  See <a href="#Init-Rebinding">Init Rebinding</a>.

   <p>By default, word-wrapped lines do not display fringe indicators. 
Visual Line mode is often used to edit files that contain many long
logical lines, so having a fringe indicator for each wrapped line
would be visually distracting.  You can change this by customizing the
variable <code>visual-line-fringe-indicators</code>.

<h3 class="section">14.23 Customization of Display</h3>

<p>This section describes variables that control miscellaneous aspects
of the appearance of the Emacs screen.  Beginning users can skip it.

   <p><a name="index-visible_002dbell-844"></a>  If the variable <code>visible-bell</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, Emacs attempts
to make the whole screen blink when it would normally make an audible bell
sound.  This variable has no effect if your terminal does not have a way
to make the screen blink.

   <p><a name="index-echo_002dkeystrokes-845"></a>  The variable <code>echo-keystrokes</code> controls the echoing of multi-character
keys; its value is the number of seconds of pause required to cause echoing
to start, or zero, meaning don't echo at all.  The value takes effect when
there is something to echo.  See <a href="#Echo-Area">Echo Area</a>.

   <p><a name="index-mouse-pointer-846"></a><a name="index-hourglass-pointer-display-847"></a><a name="index-display_002dhourglass-848"></a><a name="index-hourglass_002ddelay-849"></a>  On graphical displays, Emacs displays the mouse pointer as an
hourglass if Emacs is busy.  To disable this feature, set the variable
<code>display-hourglass</code> to <code>nil</code>.  The variable
<code>hourglass-delay</code> determines the number of seconds of busy
time before the hourglass is shown; the default is 1.

   <p><a name="index-make_002dpointer_002dinvisible-850"></a>  If the mouse pointer lies inside an Emacs frame, Emacs makes it
invisible each time you type a character to insert text, to prevent it
from obscuring the text.  (To be precise, the hiding occurs when you
type a self-inserting character.  See <a href="#Inserting-Text">Inserting Text</a>.)  Moving
the mouse pointer makes it visible again.  To disable this feature,
set the variable <code>make-pointer-invisible</code> to <code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-underline_002dminimum_002doffset-851"></a><a name="index-x_002dunderline_002dat_002ddescent_002dline-852"></a>  On graphical displays, the variable <code>underline-minimum-offset</code>
determines the minimum distance between the baseline and underline, in
pixels, for underlined text.  By default, the value is 1; increasing
it may improve the legibility of underlined text for certain fonts. 
(However, Emacs will never draw the underline below the current line
area.)  The variable <code>x-underline-at-descent-line</code> determines how
to draw underlined text.  The default is <code>nil</code>, which means to
draw it at the baseline level of the font; if you change it to
<code>nil</code>, Emacs draws the underline at the same height as the font's
descent line.

   <p><a name="index-overline_002dmargin-853"></a>  The variable <code>overline-margin</code> specifies the vertical position
of an overline above the text, including the height of the overline
itself, in pixels; the default is 2.

   <p><a name="index-tty_002dsuppress_002dbold_002dinverse_002ddefault_002dcolors-854"></a>  On some text terminals, bold face and inverse video together result
in text that is hard to read.  Call the function
<code>tty-suppress-bold-inverse-default-colors</code> with a non-<code>nil</code>
argument to suppress the effect of bold-face in this case.

<h2 class="chapter">15 Searching and Replacement</h2>

<p><a name="index-searching-855"></a><a name="index-finding-strings-within-text-856"></a>
  Like other editors, Emacs has commands to search for occurrences of
a string.  Emacs also has commands to replace occurrences of a string
with a different string.  There are also commands that do the same
thing, but search for patterns instead of fixed strings.

   <p>You can also search multiple files under the control of <code>xref</code>
(see <a href="#Identifier-Search">Identifier Search</a>) or through the Dired <kbd>A</kbd> command
(see <a href="#Operating-on-Files">Operating on Files</a>), or ask the <code>grep</code> program to do it
(see <a href="#Grep-Searching">Grep Searching</a>).

<p><a name="index-incremental-search-857"></a><a name="index-isearch-858"></a>
  The principal search command in Emacs is <dfn>incremental</dfn>: it
begins searching as soon as you type the first character of the search
string.  As you type in the search string, Emacs shows you where the
string (as you have typed it so far) would be found.  When you have
typed enough characters to identify the place you want, you can stop. 
Depending on what you plan to do next, you may or may not need to
terminate the search explicitly with &lt;RET&gt;.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-s</kbd><dd>Begin incremental search (<code>isearch-forward</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-r</kbd><dd>Begin reverse incremental search (<code>isearch-backward</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002ds-859"></a><a name="index-isearch_002dforward-860"></a>  <kbd>C-s</kbd> (<code>isearch-forward</code>) starts a forward incremental
search.  It reads characters from the keyboard, and moves point just
past the end of the next occurrence of those characters in the buffer.

   <p>For instance, if you type <kbd>C-s</kbd> and then <kbd>F</kbd>, that puts the
cursor after the first `<samp><span class="samp">F</span></samp>' that occurs in the buffer after the
starting point.  If you then type <kbd>O</kbd>, the cursor moves to just
after the first `<samp><span class="samp">FO</span></samp>'; the `<samp><span class="samp">F</span></samp>' in that `<samp><span class="samp">FO</span></samp>' might not be
the first `<samp><span class="samp">F</span></samp>' previously found.  After another <kbd>O</kbd>, the
cursor moves to just after the first `<samp><span class="samp">FOO</span></samp>'.

   <p><a name="index-faces-for-highlighting-search-matches-861"></a><a name="index-isearch-face-862"></a>  At each step, Emacs highlights the <dfn>current match</dfn>&mdash;the buffer
text that matches the search string&mdash;using the <code>isearch</code> face
(see <a href="#Faces">Faces</a>).  See <a href="#Search-Customizations">Search Customizations</a>, for various options
that customize this highlighting.  The current search string is also
displayed in the echo area.

   <p>If you make a mistake typing the search string, type &lt;DEL&gt;. 
Each &lt;DEL&gt; cancels the last character of the search string. 
See <a href="#Error-in-Isearch">Error in Isearch</a>, for more about dealing with unsuccessful
search.

   <p><a name="index-exit-incremental-search-863"></a><a name="index-incremental-search_002c-exiting-864"></a>  When you are satisfied with the place you have reached, type
&lt;RET&gt;.  This stops searching, leaving the cursor where the search
brought it.  Also, any command not specially meaningful in searches
stops the searching and is then executed.  Thus, typing <kbd>C-a</kbd>
exits the search and then moves to the beginning of the line; typing
one of the arrow keys exits the search and performs the respective
movement command; etc.  &lt;RET&gt; is necessary only if the next
command you want to type is a printing character, &lt;DEL&gt;,
&lt;RET&gt;, or another character that is special within searches
(<kbd>C-q</kbd>, <kbd>C-w</kbd>, <kbd>C-r</kbd>, <kbd>C-s</kbd>, <kbd>C-y</kbd>, <kbd>M-y</kbd>,
<kbd>M-r</kbd>, <kbd>M-c</kbd>, <kbd>M-e</kbd>, and some others described below). 
You can fine-tune the commands that exit the search; see <a href="#Not-Exiting-Isearch">Not Exiting Isearch</a>.

   <p>As a special exception, entering &lt;RET&gt; when the search string is
empty launches nonincremental search (see <a href="#Nonincremental-Search">Nonincremental Search</a>). 
(This can be customized; see <a href="#Search-Customizations">Search Customizations</a>.)

   <p>To abandon the search and return to the place where you started,
type <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; &lt;ESC&gt; &lt;ESC&gt;</kbd> (<code>isearch-cancel</code>) or
<kbd>C-g C-g</kbd> (<code>isearch-abort</code>).

   <p>When you exit the incremental search, it adds the original value of
point to the mark ring, without activating the mark; you can thus use
<kbd>C-u C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> or <kbd>C-x C-x</kbd> to return to where you were
before beginning the search.  See <a href="#Mark-Ring">Mark Ring</a>.  (Emacs only does this
if the mark was not already active; if the mark was active when you
started the search, both <kbd>C-u C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> and <kbd>C-x C-x</kbd> will
go to the mark.)

   <p><a name="index-C_002dr-865"></a><a name="index-isearch_002dbackward-866"></a>  To search backwards, use <kbd>C-r</kbd> (<code>isearch-backward</code>) instead
of <kbd>C-s</kbd> to start the search.  A backward search finds matches
that end before the starting point, just as a forward search finds
matches that begin after it.

<h4 class="subsection">15.1.2 Repeating Incremental Search</h4>

<p>Suppose you search forward for `<samp><span class="samp">FOO</span></samp>' and find a match, but not
the one you expected to find: the `<samp><span class="samp">FOO</span></samp>' you were aiming for
occurs later in the buffer.  In this event, type another <kbd>C-s</kbd> to
move to the next occurrence of the search string.  You can repeat this
any number of times.  If you overshoot, you can cancel some <kbd>C-s</kbd>
characters with &lt;DEL&gt;.  Similarly, each <kbd>C-r</kbd> in a backward
incremental search repeats the backward search.

   <p><a name="index-lazy-search-highlighting-867"></a>  If you pause for a little while during incremental search, Emacs
highlights all the other possible matches for the search string that
are present on the screen.  This helps you anticipate where you can
get to by typing <kbd>C-s</kbd> or <kbd>C-r</kbd> to repeat the search.  The
other matches are highlighted differently from the current match,
using the customizable face <code>lazy-highlight</code> (see <a href="#Faces">Faces</a>).  If
you don't like this feature, you can disable it by setting
<code>isearch-lazy-highlight</code> to <code>nil</code>.  For other customizations
related to highlighting matches, see <a href="#Search-Customizations">Search Customizations</a>.

   <p>After exiting a search, you can search for the same string again by
typing just <kbd>C-s C-s</kbd>.  The first <kbd>C-s</kbd> is the key that
invokes incremental search, and the second <kbd>C-s</kbd> means to search
again for the last search string.  Similarly, <kbd>C-r C-r</kbd> searches
backward for the last search string.  In determining the last search
string, it doesn't matter whether that string was searched for with
<kbd>C-s</kbd> or <kbd>C-r</kbd>.

   <p>If you are searching forward but you realize you were looking for
something before the starting point, type <kbd>C-r</kbd> to switch to a
backward search, leaving the search string unchanged.  Similarly,

Repeating a failing reverse search with <kbd>C-r</kbd> starts again from
the end.  This is called <dfn>wrapping around</dfn>, and `<samp><span class="samp">Wrapped</span></samp>'
appears in the search prompt once this has happened.  If you keep on
going past the original starting point of the search, it changes to
`<samp><span class="samp">Overwrapped</span></samp>', which means that you are revisiting matches that

<p>In many cases, you will want to use text at or near point as your
search string.  The commands described in this subsection let you do
that conveniently.

character or word at point to the search string.  This is an easy way
to search for another occurrence of the text at point.  (The decision
of whether to copy a character or a word is heuristic.)

   <p><a name="index-M_002ds-C_002de-_0040r_007b_0028Incremental-search_0029_007d-882"></a><a name="index-isearch_002dyank_002dline-883"></a>  Similarly, <kbd>M-s C-e</kbd> (<code>isearch-yank-line</code>) appends the rest
of the current line to the search string.  If point is already at the
end of a line, it appends the next line.  With a prefix argument
<var>n</var>, it appends the next <var>n</var> lines.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dy-_0040r_007b_0028Incremental-search_0029_007d-884"></a><a name="index-M_002dy-_0040r_007b_0028Incremental-search_0029_007d-885"></a><a name="index-mouse_002d2-_0040r_007bin-the-minibuffer-_0028Incremental-search_0029_007d-886"></a><a name="index-isearch_002dyank_002dkill-887"></a><a name="index-isearch_002dyank_002dpop-888"></a><a name="index-isearch_002dyank_002dx_002dselection-889"></a>  Within incremental search, <kbd>C-y</kbd> (<code>isearch-yank-kill</code>)
appends the current kill to the search string.  <kbd>M-y</kbd>
(<code>isearch-yank-pop</code>), if called after <kbd>C-y</kbd>, replaces that
appended text with an earlier kill, similar to the usual <kbd>M-y</kbd>
(<code>yank-pop</code>) command (see <a href="#Yanking">Yanking</a>).  Clicking <kbd>mouse-2</kbd>
in the echo area appends the current X selection (see <a href="#Primary-Selection">Primary Selection</a>) to the search string (<code>isearch-yank-x-selection</code>).

   <p><a name="index-C_002dM_002dw-_0040r_007b_0028Incremental-search_0029_007d-890"></a><a name="index-C_002dM_002dy-_0040r_007b_0028Incremental-search_0029_007d-891"></a><a name="index-isearch_002ddel_002dchar-892"></a><a name="index-isearch_002dyank_002dchar-893"></a>  <kbd>C-M-w</kbd> (<code>isearch-del-char</code>) deletes the last character
from the search string, and <kbd>C-M-y</kbd> (<code>isearch-yank-char</code>)
appends the character after point to the search string.  An
alternative method to add the character after point is to enter the
minibuffer with <kbd>M-e</kbd> (see <a href="#Repeat-Isearch">Repeat Isearch</a>) and type <kbd>C-f</kbd>
or <kbd>&lt;RIGHT&gt;</kbd> at the end of the search string in the
minibuffer.  Each <kbd>C-f</kbd> or <kbd>&lt;RIGHT&gt;</kbd> you type adds another
character following point to the search string.

   <p>Normally, when the search is case-insensitive, text yanked into the
search string is converted to lower case, so that the search remains
case-insensitive (see <a href="#Lax-Search">case folding</a>).  However, if the
value of the variable <code>search-upper-case</code> (see <a href="#Lax-Search">search-upper-case</a>) is other than <code>not-yanks</code>, that disables this
down-casing.

<h4 class="subsection">15.1.4 Errors in Incremental Search</h4>

<p><a name="index-isearch_002dfail-face-894"></a>  If your string is not found at all, the echo area says `<samp><span class="samp">Failing
I-Search</span></samp>', and the cursor moves past the place where Emacs found as
much of your string as it could.  Thus, if you search for `<samp><span class="samp">FOOT</span></samp>',
and there is no `<samp><span class="samp">FOOT</span></samp>', you might see the cursor after the
`<samp><span class="samp">FOO</span></samp>' in `<samp><span class="samp">FOOL</span></samp>'.  In the echo area, the part of the search
string that failed to match is highlighted using the face
<code>isearch-fail</code>.

   <p>At this point, there are several things you can do.  If your string
was mistyped, you can use &lt;DEL&gt; to erase some of it and correct
it, or you can type <kbd>M-e</kbd> and edit it.  If you like the place you
have found, you can type &lt;RET&gt; to remain there.  Or you can type
<kbd>C-g</kbd>, which removes from the search string the characters that
could not be found (the `<samp><span class="samp">T</span></samp>' in `<samp><span class="samp">FOOT</span></samp>'), leaving those that
were found (the `<samp><span class="samp">FOO</span></samp>' in `<samp><span class="samp">FOOT</span></samp>').  A second <kbd>C-g</kbd> at
that point cancels the search entirely, returning point to where it
was when the search started.

just what it does depends on the status of the search.  If the search
has found what you specified and is waiting for input, <kbd>C-g</kbd>
cancels the entire search, moving the cursor back to where you started
the search.  If <kbd>C-g</kbd> is typed when there are characters in the
search string that have not been found&mdash;because Emacs is still
searching for them, or because it has failed to find them&mdash;then the
search string characters which have not been found are discarded from
the search string.  With them gone, the search is now successful and
waiting for more input, so a second <kbd>C-g</kbd> will cancel the entire
search.

<h4 class="subsection">15.1.5 Special Input for Incremental Search</h4>

<p>In addition to characters described in the previous subsections,
some of the other characters you type during incremental search have
special effects.  They are described here.

   <p>To toggle lax space matching (see <a href="#Lax-Search">lax space matching</a>), type <kbd>M-s &lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>.

   <p>To toggle case sensitivity of the search, type <kbd>M-c</kbd> or
<kbd>M-s c</kbd>.  See <a href="#Lax-Search">case folding</a>.  If the search string
includes upper-case letters, the search is case-sensitive by default.

   <p>To toggle whether or not the search will consider similar and
equivalent characters as a match, type <kbd>M-s '</kbd>.  See <a href="#Lax-Search">character folding</a>.  If the search string includes accented
characters, that disables character folding during that search.

   <p><a name="index-invisible-text_002c-searching-for-897"></a><a name="index-M_002ds-i-_0040r_007b_0028Incremental-search_0029_007d-898"></a><a name="index-isearch_002dtoggle_002dinvisible-899"></a>  To toggle whether or not invisible text is searched, type
<kbd>M-s i</kbd> (<code>isearch-toggle-invisible</code>).  See <a href="#Outline-Search">Outline Search</a>.

   <p><a name="index-M_002dr-_0040r_007b_0028Incremental-Search_0029_007d-900"></a><a name="index-M_002ds-r-_0040r_007b_0028Incremental-Search_0029_007d-901"></a><a name="index-isearch_002dtoggle_002dregexp-902"></a>  To toggle between non-regexp and regexp incremental search, type
<kbd>M-r</kbd> or <kbd>M-s r</kbd> (<code>isearch-toggle-regexp</code>). 
See <a href="#Regexp-Search">Regexp Search</a>.

   <p>To toggle symbol mode, type <kbd>M-s _</kbd>.  See <a href="#Symbol-Search">Symbol Search</a>.

   <p>To search for a newline character, type <kbd>C-j</kbd> as part of the
search string.

   <p>To search for non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters, use one of the
following methods:

     <ul>
<li>Type <kbd>C-q</kbd>, followed by a non-graphic character or a sequence of
octal digits.  This adds a character to the search string, similar to
inserting into a buffer using <kbd>C-q</kbd> (see <a href="#Inserting-Text">Inserting Text</a>).  For
example, <kbd>C-q C-s</kbd> during incremental search adds the
`<samp><span class="samp">control-S</span></samp>' character to the search string.

     <li>Type <kbd>C-x 8 &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>, followed by a Unicode name or code-point
in hex.  This adds the specified character into the search string,
similar to the usual <code>insert-char</code> command (see <a href="#Inserting-Text">Inserting Text</a>).

     <li><a name="index-C_002d_005e-_0040r_007b_0028Incremental-Search_0029_007d-903"></a><a name="index-isearch_002dtoggle_002dinput_002dmethod-904"></a><a name="index-isearch_002dtoggle_002dspecified_002dinput_002dmethod-905"></a>Use an input method (see <a href="#Input-Methods">Input Methods</a>).  If an input method is
enabled in the current buffer when you start the search, the same
method will be active in the minibuffer when you type the search
string.  While typing the search string, you can toggle the input
method with <kbd>C-\</kbd> (<code>isearch-toggle-input-method</code>).  You can
also turn on a non-default input method with <kbd>C-^</kbd>
(<code>isearch-toggle-specified-input-method</code>), which prompts for the
name of the input method.  When an input method is active during
incremental search, the search prompt includes the input method
mnemonic, like this:

     <pre class="example">          I-search [<var>im</var>]:
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">where <var>im</var> is the mnemonic of the active input method.  Any input
method you enable during incremental search remains enabled in the
current buffer afterwards. 
</ul>

<code>isearch-occur</code>, which runs <code>occur</code> with the current search
string.  See <a href="#Other-Repeating-Search">occur</a>.

   <p><a name="index-M_002d_0025-_0040r_007b_0028Incremental-search_0029_007d-908"></a>  Typing <kbd>M-%</kbd> in incremental search invokes <code>query-replace</code>
or <code>query-replace-regexp</code> (depending on search mode) with the
current search string used as the string to replace.  A negative
prefix argument means to replace backward.  See <a href="#Query-Replace">Query Replace</a>.

   <p><a name="index-M_002dTAB-_0040r_007b_0028Incremental-search_0029_007d-909"></a>  Typing <kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> in incremental search invokes
<code>isearch-complete</code>, which attempts to complete the search string
using the search ring (the previous search strings you used) as a list
of completion alternatives.  See <a href="#Completion">Completion</a>.  In many operating
systems, the <kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> key sequence is captured by the window
manager; you then need to rebind <code>isearch-complete</code> to another
key sequence if you want to use it (see <a href="#Rebinding">Rebinding</a>).

   <p><a name="index-M_002ds-h-r-_0040r_007b_0028Incremental-Search_0029_007d-910"></a><a name="index-isearch_002dhighlight_002dregexp-911"></a>  You can exit the search while leaving the matches for the last
search string highlighted on display.  To this end, type <kbd>M-s h r</kbd>
(<code>isearch-highlight-regexp</code>), which will run
<code>highlight-regexp</code> (see <a href="#Highlight-Interactively">Highlight Interactively</a>) passing
it the regexp derived from the last search string and prompting you
for the face to use for highlighting.  To remove the highlighting,
type <kbd>M-s h u</kbd> (<code>unhighlight-regexp</code>).

(<code>isearch-help-map</code>) to access interactive help options,
including a list of special key bindings.  These key bindings are part
of the keymap <code>isearch-mode-map</code> (see <a href="#Keymaps">Keymaps</a>).

<h4 class="subsection">15.1.6 Not Exiting Incremental Search</h4>

<p>This subsection describes how to control whether typing a command not
specifically meaningful is searches exits the search before executing
the command.  It also describes two categories of commands which you
can type without exiting the current incremental search, even though
they are not themselves part of incremental search.

   <p><a name="index-search_002dexit_002doption-916"></a>  Normally, typing a command that is not bound by the incremental
search exits the search before executing the command.  Thus, the
command operates on the buffer from which you invoked the search. 
However, if you customize the variable <code>search-exit-option</code> to
<code>nil</code>, the characters which you type that are not interpreted by
the incremental search are simply appended to the search string.  This
is so you could include in the search string control characters, such
as <kbd>C-a</kbd>, that would normally exit the search and invoke the
command bound to them on the buffer.

     <dl>
<dt>Prefix Arguments<dd><a name="index-prefix-argument-commands_002c-during-incremental-search-917"></a><a name="index-isearch_002dallow_002dprefix-918"></a>  In incremental search, when you type a command that specifies a
prefix argument (see <a href="#Arguments">Arguments</a>), by default it will apply either
to the next action in the search or to the command that exits the
search.  In other words, entering a prefix argument will not by itself
terminate the search.

     <p>In previous versions of Emacs, entering a prefix argument always
terminated the search.  You can revert to this behavior by setting the
variable <code>isearch-allow-prefix</code> to <code>nil</code>.

     <p>When <code>isearch-allow-scroll</code> is non-<code>nil</code> (see below),
prefix arguments always have the default behavior described above,
i.e., they don't terminate the search, even if
<code>isearch-allow-prefix</code> is <code>nil</code>.

     <br><dt>Scrolling Commands<dd><a name="index-scrolling-commands_002c-during-incremental-search-919"></a><a name="index-isearch_002dallow_002dscroll-920"></a>  Normally, scrolling commands exit incremental search.  If you change
the variable <code>isearch-allow-scroll</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> value,
that enables the use of the scroll-bar, as well as keyboard scrolling
commands like <kbd>C-v</kbd>, <kbd>M-v</kbd>, and <kbd>C-l</kbd> (see <a href="#Scrolling">Scrolling</a>). 
This applies only to calling these commands via their bound key
sequences&mdash;typing <kbd>M-x</kbd> will still exit the search.  You can give
prefix arguments to these commands in the usual way.  This feature
won't let you scroll the current match out of visibility, however.

     <p>The <code>isearch-allow-scroll</code> feature also affects some other
commands, such as <kbd>C-x 2</kbd> (<code>split-window-below</code>) and
<kbd>C-x ^</kbd> (<code>enlarge-window</code>), which don't exactly scroll but do
affect where the text appears on the screen.  It applies to any
command whose name has a non-<code>nil</code> <code>isearch-scroll</code>
property.  So you can control which commands are affected by changing
these properties.

     <p><a name="index-prevent-commands-from-exiting-incremental-search-921"></a>  For example, to make <kbd>C-h l</kbd> usable within an incremental search
in all future Emacs sessions, use <kbd>C-h c</kbd> to find what command it
runs (see <a href="#Key-Help">Key Help</a>), which is <code>view-lossage</code>.  Then you can
put the following line in your init file (see <a href="#Init-File">Init File</a>):

     <pre class="example">          (put 'view-lossage 'isearch-scroll t)
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">This feature can be applied to any command that doesn't permanently
change point, the buffer contents, the match data, the current buffer,
or the selected window and frame.  The command must not itself attempt
an incremental search.  This feature is disabled if
<code>isearch-allow-scroll</code> is <code>nil</code> (which it is by default).

<h4 class="subsection">15.1.7 Searching the Minibuffer</h4>

<p><a name="index-minibuffer-history_002c-searching-922"></a>
If you start an incremental search while the minibuffer is active,
Emacs searches the contents of the minibuffer.  Unlike searching an
ordinary buffer, the search string is not shown in the echo area,
because that is used to display the minibuffer.

   <p>If an incremental search fails in the minibuffer, it tries searching
the minibuffer history.  See <a href="#Minibuffer-History">Minibuffer History</a>.  You can visualize
the minibuffer and its history as a series of pages, with the
earliest history element on the first page and the current minibuffer
on the last page.  A forward search, <kbd>C-s</kbd>, searches forward to
later pages; a reverse search, <kbd>C-r</kbd>, searches backwards to
earlier pages.  Like in ordinary buffer search, a failing search can
wrap around, going from the last page to the first page or vice versa.

   <p>When the current match is on a history element, that history element
is pulled into the minibuffer.  If you exit the incremental search
normally (e.g., by typing &lt;RET&gt;), it remains in the minibuffer
afterwards.  Canceling the search, with <kbd>C-g</kbd>, restores the
contents of the minibuffer when you began the search.

<h3 class="section">15.2 Nonincremental Search</h3>

<p><a name="index-nonincremental-search-923"></a>
  Emacs also has conventional nonincremental search commands, which require
you to type the entire search string before searching begins.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-s &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>string</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Search for <var>string</var>. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-r &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>string</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Search backward for <var>string</var>. 
</dl>

   <p>To start a nonincremental search, first type <kbd>C-s &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>. 
This enters the minibuffer to read the search string; terminate the
string with &lt;RET&gt;, and then the search takes place.  If the string
is not found, the search command signals an error.

   <p>When you type <kbd>C-s &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>, the <kbd>C-s</kbd> invokes incremental
search as usual.  That command is specially programmed to invoke the
command for nonincremental search, if the string you specify is empty. 
(Such an empty argument would otherwise be useless.)  <kbd>C-r
&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> does likewise, invoking the nonincremental
backward-searching command.

   <p>Nonincremental search can also be invoked form the menu bar's
`<samp><span class="samp">Edit-&gt;Search</span></samp>' menu.

   <p><a name="index-search_002dforward-924"></a><a name="index-search_002dbackward-925"></a>  You can also use two simpler commands, <kbd>M-x search-forward</kbd> and
<kbd>M-x search-backward</kbd>.  These commands look for the literal
strings you specify, and don't support any of the lax-search features
(see <a href="#Lax-Search">Lax Search</a>) except case folding.

<h3 class="section">15.3 Word Search</h3>

<p><a name="index-word-search-926"></a>
  A <dfn>word search</dfn> finds a sequence of words without regard to the
type of punctuation between them.  For instance, if you enter a search
string that consists of two words separated by a single space, the
search matches any sequence of those two words separated by one or
more spaces, newlines, or other punctuation characters.  This is
particularly useful for searching text documents, because you don't
have to worry whether the words you are looking for are separated by
newlines or spaces.  Note that major modes for programming languages
or other specialized modes can modify the definition of a word to suit

   <p>Incremental and nonincremental word searches differ slightly in the
way they find a match.  In a nonincremental word search, each word in
the search string must exactly match a whole word.  In an incremental
word search, the matching is more lax: while you are typing the search
string, its first and last words need not match whole words.  This is
so that the matching can proceed incrementally as you type.  This
additional laxity does not apply to the lazy highlight
(see <a href="#Incremental-Search">Incremental Search</a>), which always matches whole words.

   <p>The word search commands don't perform character folding, and
toggling lax whitespace matching (see <a href="#Lax-Search">lax space matching</a>) has no effect on them.

<h3 class="section">15.4 Symbol Search</h3>

<p><a name="index-symbol-search-934"></a>
  A <dfn>symbol search</dfn> is much like an ordinary search, except that
the boundaries of the search must match the boundaries of a symbol. 
The meaning of <dfn>symbol</dfn> in this context depends on the major mode,
and usually refers to a source code token, such as a Lisp symbol in
Emacs Lisp mode.  For instance, if you perform an incremental symbol
search for the Lisp symbol <code>forward-word</code>, it would not match
<code>isearch-forward-word</code>.  This feature is thus mainly useful for
searching source code.

active, <kbd>M-s _</kbd> switches to a symbol search, preserving the
direction of the search and the current search string; you can disable
symbol search by typing <kbd>M-s _</kbd> again.  In incremental symbol
search, only the beginning of the search string is required to match
the beginning of a symbol.

toggling lax whitespace matching (see <a href="#Lax-Search">lax space matching</a>) has no effect on them.

<h3 class="section">15.5 Regular Expression Search</h3>

<p><a name="index-regexp-search-940"></a><a name="index-search-for-a-regular-expression-941"></a>
  A <dfn>regular expression</dfn> (or <dfn>regexp</dfn> for short) is a pattern
that denotes a class of alternative strings to match.  Emacs
provides both incremental and nonincremental ways to search for a
match for a regexp.  The syntax of regular expressions is explained in
the next section.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-M-s</kbd><dd>Begin incremental regexp search (<code>isearch-forward-regexp</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-M-r</kbd><dd>Begin reverse incremental regexp search (<code>isearch-backward-regexp</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dM_002ds-942"></a><a name="index-isearch_002dforward_002dregexp-943"></a><a name="index-C_002dM_002dr-944"></a><a name="index-isearch_002dbackward_002dregexp-945"></a>  Incremental search for a regexp is done by typing <kbd>C-M-s</kbd>
(<code>isearch-forward-regexp</code>), by invoking <kbd>C-s</kbd> with a
prefix argument (whose value does not matter), or by typing <kbd>M-r</kbd>
within a forward incremental search.  This command reads a
search string incrementally just like <kbd>C-s</kbd>, but it treats the
search string as a regexp rather than looking for an exact match
against the text in the buffer.  Each time you add text to the search
string, you make the regexp longer, and the new regexp is searched
for.  To search backward for a regexp, use <kbd>C-M-r</kbd>
(<code>isearch-backward-regexp</code>), <kbd>C-r</kbd> with a prefix argument,
or <kbd>M-r</kbd> within a backward incremental search.

   <p><a name="index-regexp_002dsearch_002dring_002dmax-946"></a>  All of the special key sequences in an ordinary incremental search
(see <a href="#Special-Isearch">Special Isearch</a>) do similar things in an incremental regexp
search.  For instance, typing <kbd>C-s</kbd> immediately after starting the
search retrieves the last incremental search regexp used and searches
forward for it.  Incremental regexp and non-regexp searches have
independent defaults.  They also have separate search rings, which you
can access with <kbd>M-p</kbd> and <kbd>M-n</kbd>.  The maximum number of search
regexps saved in the search ring is determined by the value of
<code>regexp-search-ring-max</code>, 16 by default.

   <p>Unlike ordinary incremental search, incremental regexp search
does not use lax space matching by default.  To toggle this feature
use <kbd>M-s &lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> (<code>isearch-toggle-lax-whitespace</code>). 
Then any &lt;SPC&gt; typed in incremental regexp search will match
any sequence of one or more whitespace characters.  The variable
<code>search-whitespace-regexp</code> specifies the regexp for the lax
space matching.  See <a href="#Special-Isearch">Special Isearch</a>.

   <p>Also unlike ordinary incremental search, incremental regexp search
cannot use character folding (see <a href="#Lax-Search">Lax Search</a>).  (If you toggle
character folding during incremental regexp search with <kbd>M-s '</kbd>,
the search becomes a non-regexp search and the search pattern you
typed is interpreted as a literal string.)

   <p>In some cases, adding characters to the regexp in an incremental
regexp search can make the cursor move back and start again.  For
example, if you have searched for `<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>' and you add `<samp><span class="samp">\|bar</span></samp>',
the cursor backs up in case the first `<samp><span class="samp">bar</span></samp>' precedes the first
`<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>'.  See <a href="#Regexps">Regexps</a>.

   <p>Forward and backward regexp search are not symmetrical, because
regexp matching in Emacs always operates forward, starting with the
beginning of the regexp.  Thus, forward regexp search scans forward,
trying a forward match at each possible starting position.  Backward
regexp search scans backward, trying a forward match at each possible
starting position.  These search methods are not mirror images.

   <p><a name="index-re_002dsearch_002dforward-947"></a><a name="index-re_002dsearch_002dbackward-948"></a>  Nonincremental search for a regexp is done with the commands
<code>re-search-forward</code> and <code>re-search-backward</code>.  You can
invoke these with <kbd>M-x</kbd>, or by way of incremental regexp search
with <kbd>C-M-s &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> and <kbd>C-M-r &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.  When you invoke
these commands with <kbd>M-x</kbd>, they search for the exact regexp you
specify, and thus don't support any lax-search features (see <a href="#Lax-Search">Lax Search</a>) except case folding.

   <p>If you use the incremental regexp search commands with a prefix
argument, they perform ordinary string search, like
<code>isearch-forward</code> and <code>isearch-backward</code>.  See <a href="#Incremental-Search">Incremental Search</a>.

<h3 class="section">15.6 Syntax of Regular Expressions</h3>

<p><a name="index-syntax-of-regexps-949"></a><a name="index-regular-expression-950"></a><a name="index-regexp-951"></a>
  This manual describes regular expression features that users
typically use.  See <a href="elisp.html#Regular-Expressions">Regular Expressions</a>, for additional features used mainly in Lisp
programs.

   <p>Regular expressions have a syntax in which a few characters are
special constructs and the rest are <dfn>ordinary</dfn>.  An ordinary
character matches that same character and nothing else.  The special
characters are `<samp><span class="samp">$^.*+?[\</span></samp>'.  The character `<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>' is special if
it ends a character alternative (see later).  The character `<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>'
is special inside a character alternative.  Any other character
appearing in a regular expression is ordinary, unless a `<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>'
precedes it.  (When you use regular expressions in a Lisp program,
each `<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>' must be doubled, see the example near the end of this
section.)

   <p>For example, `<samp><span class="samp">f</span></samp>' is not a special character, so it is ordinary, and
therefore `<samp><span class="samp">f</span></samp>' is a regular expression that matches the string
`<samp><span class="samp">f</span></samp>' and no other string.  (It does <em>not</em> match the string
`<samp><span class="samp">ff</span></samp>'.)  Likewise, `<samp><span class="samp">o</span></samp>' is a regular expression that matches
only `<samp><span class="samp">o</span></samp>'.  (When case distinctions are being ignored, these regexps
also match `<samp><span class="samp">F</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">O</span></samp>', but we consider this a generalization
of &ldquo;the same string&rdquo;, rather than an exception.)

   <p>Any two regular expressions <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> can be concatenated. 
The result is a regular expression which matches a string if <var>a</var>
matches some amount of the beginning of that string and <var>b</var>
matches the rest of the string.  For example, concatenating the
regular expressions `<samp><span class="samp">f</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">o</span></samp>' gives the regular expression
`<samp><span class="samp">fo</span></samp>', which matches only the string `<samp><span class="samp">fo</span></samp>'.  Still trivial. 
To do something nontrivial, you need to use one of the special
characters.  Here is a list of them.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>.</kbd> <span class="roman">(Period)</span><dd>is a special character that matches any single character except a
newline.  For example, the regular expressions `<samp><span class="samp">a.b</span></samp>' matches any
three-character string that begins with `<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>' and ends with
`<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>'.

     <br><dt><kbd>*</kbd><dd>is not a construct by itself; it is a postfix operator that means to
match the preceding regular expression repetitively any number of
times, as many times as possible.  Thus, `<samp><span class="samp">o*</span></samp>' matches any number
of `<samp><span class="samp">o</span></samp>'s, including no `<samp><span class="samp">o</span></samp>'s.

     <p>`<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' always applies to the <em>smallest</em> possible preceding
expression.  Thus, `<samp><span class="samp">fo*</span></samp>' has a repeating `<samp><span class="samp">o</span></samp>', not a repeating
`<samp><span class="samp">fo</span></samp>'.  It matches `<samp><span class="samp">f</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">fo</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>', and so on.

     <p>The matcher processes a `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' construct by matching, immediately,
as many repetitions as can be found.  Then it continues with the rest
of the pattern.  If that fails, backtracking occurs, discarding some
of the matches of the `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>'-modified construct in case that makes
it possible to match the rest of the pattern.  For example, in matching
`<samp><span class="samp">ca*ar</span></samp>' against the string `<samp><span class="samp">caaar</span></samp>', the `<samp><span class="samp">a*</span></samp>' first
tries to match all three `<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>'s; but the rest of the pattern is
`<samp><span class="samp">ar</span></samp>' and there is only `<samp><span class="samp">r</span></samp>' left to match, so this try fails. 
The next alternative is for `<samp><span class="samp">a*</span></samp>' to match only two `<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>'s. 
With this choice, the rest of the regexp matches successfully.

     <br><dt><kbd>+</kbd><dd>is a postfix operator, similar to `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' except that it must match
the preceding expression at least once.  Thus, `<samp><span class="samp">ca+r</span></samp>' matches the
strings `<samp><span class="samp">car</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">caaaar</span></samp>' but not the string `<samp><span class="samp">cr</span></samp>',
whereas `<samp><span class="samp">ca*r</span></samp>' matches all three strings.

     <br><dt><kbd>?</kbd><dd>is a postfix operator, similar to `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' except that it can match
the preceding expression either once or not at all.  Thus, `<samp><span class="samp">ca?r</span></samp>'
matches `<samp><span class="samp">car</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">cr</span></samp>', and nothing else.

     <br><dt><kbd>*?</kbd>, <kbd>+?</kbd>, <kbd>??</kbd><dd><a name="index-non_002dgreedy-regexp-matching-952"></a>are non-<dfn>greedy</dfn> variants of the operators above.  The normal
operators `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>' match as much as they can, as
long as the overall regexp can still match.  With a following
`<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>', they will match as little as possible.

     <p>Thus, both `<samp><span class="samp">ab*</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">ab*?</span></samp>' can match the string `<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>'
and the string `<samp><span class="samp">abbbb</span></samp>'; but if you try to match them both against
the text `<samp><span class="samp">abbb</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">ab*</span></samp>' will match it all (the longest valid
match), while `<samp><span class="samp">ab*?</span></samp>'  will match just `<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>' (the shortest
valid match).

     <p>Non-greedy operators match the shortest possible string starting at a
given starting point; in a forward search, though, the earliest
possible starting point for match is always the one chosen.  Thus, if
you search for `<samp><span class="samp">a.*?$</span></samp>' against the text `<samp><span class="samp">abbab</span></samp>' followed by
a newline, it matches the whole string.  Since it <em>can</em> match
starting at the first `<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>', it does.

     <br><dt><kbd>\{</kbd><var>n</var><kbd>\}</kbd><dd>is a postfix operator specifying <var>n</var> repetitions&mdash;that is, the
preceding regular expression must match exactly <var>n</var> times in a
row.  For example, `<samp><span class="samp">x\{4\}</span></samp>' matches the string `<samp><span class="samp">xxxx</span></samp>' and
nothing else.

     <br><dt><kbd>\{</kbd><var>n</var><kbd>,</kbd><var>m</var><kbd>\}</kbd><dd>is a postfix operator specifying between <var>n</var> and <var>m</var>
repetitions&mdash;that is, the preceding regular expression must match at
least <var>n</var> times, but no more than <var>m</var> times.  If <var>m</var> is
omitted, then there is no upper limit, but the preceding regular
expression must match at least <var>n</var> times.<br> `<samp><span class="samp">\{0,1\}</span></samp>' is
equivalent to `<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>'. <br> `<samp><span class="samp">\{0,\}</span></samp>' is equivalent to
`<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>'. <br> `<samp><span class="samp">\{1,\}</span></samp>' is equivalent to `<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>'.

     <br><dt><kbd>[ ... ]</kbd><dd>is a <dfn>character set</dfn>, beginning with `<samp><span class="samp">[</span></samp>' and terminated by
`<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>'.

     <p>In the simplest case, the characters between the two brackets are what
this set can match.  Thus, `<samp><span class="samp">[ad]</span></samp>' matches either one `<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>' or
one `<samp><span class="samp">d</span></samp>', and `<samp><span class="samp">[ad]*</span></samp>' matches any string composed of just
`<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>'s and `<samp><span class="samp">d</span></samp>'s (including the empty string).  It follows that
`<samp><span class="samp">c[ad]*r</span></samp>' matches `<samp><span class="samp">cr</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">car</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">cdr</span></samp>',
`<samp><span class="samp">caddaar</span></samp>', etc.

     <p>You can also include character ranges in a character set, by writing the
starting and ending characters with a `<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>' between them.  Thus,
`<samp><span class="samp">[a-z]</span></samp>' matches any lower-case <acronym>ASCII</acronym> letter.  Ranges may be
intermixed freely with individual characters, as in `<samp><span class="samp">[a-z$%.]</span></samp>',
which matches any lower-case <acronym>ASCII</acronym> letter or `<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>' or
period.

     <p>You can also include certain special <dfn>character classes</dfn> in a
character set.  A `<samp><span class="samp">[:</span></samp>' and balancing `<samp><span class="samp">:]</span></samp>' enclose a
character class inside a character alternative.  For instance,
`<samp><span class="samp">[[:alnum:]]</span></samp>' matches any letter or digit.  See <a href="elisp.html#Char-Classes">Char Classes</a>, for a list of character
classes.

     <p>To include a `<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>' in a character set, you must make it the first
character.  For example, `<samp><span class="samp">[]a]</span></samp>' matches `<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>'.  To
include a `<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>', write `<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>' as the first or last character of the
set, or put it after a range.  Thus, `<samp><span class="samp">[]-]</span></samp>' matches both `<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>'
and `<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>'.

     <p>To include `<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>' in a set, put it anywhere but at the beginning of
the set.  (At the beginning, it complements the set&mdash;see below.)

     <p>When you use a range in case-insensitive search, you should write both
ends of the range in upper case, or both in lower case, or both should
be non-letters.  The behavior of a mixed-case range such as `<samp><span class="samp">A-z</span></samp>'
is somewhat ill-defined, and it may change in future Emacs versions.

     <br><dt><kbd>[^ ... ]</kbd><dd>`<samp><span class="samp">[^</span></samp>' begins a <dfn>complemented character set</dfn>, which matches any
character except the ones specified.  Thus, `<samp><span class="samp">[^a-z0-9A-Z]</span></samp>' matches
all characters <em>except</em> <acronym>ASCII</acronym> letters and digits.

     <p>`<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>' is not special in a character set unless it is the first
character.  The character following the `<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>' is treated as if it
were first (in other words, `<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>' are not special there).

     <p>A complemented character set can match a newline, unless newline is
mentioned as one of the characters not to match.  This is in contrast to
the handling of regexps in programs such as <code>grep</code>.

     <br><dt><kbd>^</kbd><dd>is a special character that matches the empty string, but only at the
beginning of a line in the text being matched.  Otherwise it fails to
match anything.  Thus, `<samp><span class="samp">^foo</span></samp>' matches a `<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>' that occurs at
the beginning of a line.

     <p>For historical compatibility reasons, `<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>' can be used with this
meaning only at the beginning of the regular expression, or after
`<samp><span class="samp">\(</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">\|</span></samp>'.

     <br><dt><kbd>$</kbd><dd>is similar to `<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>' but matches only at the end of a line.  Thus,
`<samp><span class="samp">x+$</span></samp>' matches a string of one `<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>' or more at the end of a line.

     <p>For historical compatibility reasons, `<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>' can be used with this
meaning only at the end of the regular expression, or before `<samp><span class="samp">\)</span></samp>'
or `<samp><span class="samp">\|</span></samp>'.

     <br><dt><kbd>\</kbd><dd>has two functions: it quotes the special characters (including
`<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>'), and it introduces additional special constructs.

     <p>Because `<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>' quotes special characters, `<samp><span class="samp">\$</span></samp>' is a regular
expression that matches only `<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>', and `<samp><span class="samp">\[</span></samp>' is a regular
expression that matches only `<samp><span class="samp">[</span></samp>', and so on.

     <p>See the following section for the special constructs that begin
with `<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>'. 
</dl>

   <p>Note: for historical compatibility, special characters are treated as
ordinary ones if they are in contexts where their special meanings make no
sense.  For example, `<samp><span class="samp">*foo</span></samp>' treats `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' as ordinary since there is
no preceding expression on which the `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' can act.  It is poor practice
to depend on this behavior; it is better to quote the special character anyway,
regardless of where it appears.

   <p>As a `<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>' is not special inside a character alternative, it can
never remove the special meaning of `<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>'.  So you
should not quote these characters when they have no special meaning
either.  This would not clarify anything, since backslashes can
legitimately precede these characters where they <em>have</em> special
meaning, as in `<samp><span class="samp">[^\]</span></samp>' (<code>"[^\\]"</code> for Lisp string syntax),
which matches any single character except a backslash.

that character.  However, there are several exceptions: two-character
sequences starting with `<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>' that have special meanings.  The
second character in the sequence is always an ordinary character when
used on its own.  Here is a table of `<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>' constructs.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>\|</kbd><dd>specifies an alternative.  Two regular expressions <var>a</var> and <var>b</var>
with `<samp><span class="samp">\|</span></samp>' in between form an expression that matches some text if
either <var>a</var> matches it or <var>b</var> matches it.  It works by trying to
match <var>a</var>, and if that fails, by trying to match <var>b</var>.

     <p>Thus, `<samp><span class="samp">foo\|bar</span></samp>' matches either `<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">bar</span></samp>'
but no other string.

     <p>`<samp><span class="samp">\|</span></samp>' applies to the largest possible surrounding expressions.  Only a
surrounding `<samp><span class="samp">\( ... \)</span></samp>' grouping can limit the grouping power of
`<samp><span class="samp">\|</span></samp>'.

     <p>Full backtracking capability exists to handle multiple uses of `<samp><span class="samp">\|</span></samp>'.

     <br><dt><kbd>\( ... \)</kbd><dd>is a grouping construct that serves three purposes:

          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>To enclose a set of `<samp><span class="samp">\|</span></samp>' alternatives for other operations. 
Thus, `<samp><span class="samp">\(foo\|bar\)x</span></samp>' matches either `<samp><span class="samp">foox</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">barx</span></samp>'.

          <li>To enclose a complicated expression for the postfix operators `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>',
`<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>' to operate on.  Thus, `<samp><span class="samp">ba\(na\)*</span></samp>' matches
`<samp><span class="samp">bananana</span></samp>', etc., with any (zero or more) number of `<samp><span class="samp">na</span></samp>'
strings.

          <li>To record a matched substring for future reference.
          </ol>

     <p>This last application is not a consequence of the idea of a
parenthetical grouping; it is a separate feature that is assigned as a
second meaning to the same `<samp><span class="samp">\( ... \)</span></samp>' construct.  In practice
there is usually no conflict between the two meanings; when there is
a conflict, you can use a shy group.

     <br><dt><kbd>\(?: ... \)</kbd><dd><a name="index-shy-group_002c-in-regexp-953"></a>specifies a shy group that does not record the matched substring;
you can't refer back to it with `<samp><span class="samp">\</span><var>d</var></samp>' (see below).  This is
useful in mechanically combining regular expressions, so that you can
add groups for syntactic purposes without interfering with the
numbering of the groups that are meant to be referred to.

     <br><dt><kbd>\</kbd><var>d</var><dd><a name="index-back-reference_002c-in-regexp-954"></a>matches the same text that matched the <var>d</var>th occurrence of a
`<samp><span class="samp">\( ... \)</span></samp>' construct.  This is called a <dfn>back
reference</dfn>.

     <p>After the end of a `<samp><span class="samp">\( ... \)</span></samp>' construct, the matcher remembers
the beginning and end of the text matched by that construct.  Then,
later on in the regular expression, you can use `<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>' followed by the
digit <var>d</var> to mean &ldquo;match the same text matched the <var>d</var>th time
by the `<samp><span class="samp">\( ... \)</span></samp>' construct&rdquo;.

     <p>The strings matching the first nine `<samp><span class="samp">\( ... \)</span></samp>' constructs
appearing in a regular expression are assigned numbers 1 through 9 in
the order that the open-parentheses appear in the regular expression. 
So you can use `<samp><span class="samp">\1</span></samp>' through `<samp><span class="samp">\9</span></samp>' to refer to the text matched
by the corresponding `<samp><span class="samp">\( ... \)</span></samp>' constructs.

     <p>For example, `<samp><span class="samp">\(.*\)\1</span></samp>' matches any newline-free string that is
composed of two identical halves.  The `<samp><span class="samp">\(.*\)</span></samp>' matches the first
half, which may be anything, but the `<samp><span class="samp">\1</span></samp>' that follows must match
the same exact text.

     <p>If a particular `<samp><span class="samp">\( ... \)</span></samp>' construct matches more than once
(which can easily happen if it is followed by `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>'), only the last
match is recorded.

     <br><dt><kbd>\`</kbd><dd>matches the empty string, but only at the beginning of the string or
buffer (or its accessible portion) being matched against.

     <br><dt><kbd>\'</kbd><dd>matches the empty string, but only at the end of the string or buffer
(or its accessible portion) being matched against.

     <br><dt><kbd>\=</kbd><dd>matches the empty string, but only at point.

     <br><dt><kbd>\b</kbd><dd>matches the empty string, but only at the beginning or
end of a word.  Thus, `<samp><span class="samp">\bfoo\b</span></samp>' matches any occurrence of
`<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>' as a separate word.  `<samp><span class="samp">\bballs?\b</span></samp>' matches
`<samp><span class="samp">ball</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">balls</span></samp>' as a separate word.

     <p>`<samp><span class="samp">\b</span></samp>' matches at the beginning or end of the buffer
regardless of what text appears next to it.

     <br><dt><kbd>\B</kbd><dd>matches the empty string, but <em>not</em> at the beginning or
end of a word.

     <br><dt><kbd>\&lt;</kbd><dd>matches the empty string, but only at the beginning of a word. 
`<samp><span class="samp">\&lt;</span></samp>' matches at the beginning of the buffer only if a
word-constituent character follows.

     <br><dt><kbd>\&gt;</kbd><dd>matches the empty string, but only at the end of a word.  `<samp><span class="samp">\&gt;</span></samp>'
matches at the end of the buffer only if the contents end with a
word-constituent character.

     <br><dt><kbd>\w</kbd><dd>matches any word-constituent character.  The syntax table determines
which characters these are.  See <a href="elisp.html#Syntax-Tables">Syntax Tables</a>.

     <br><dt><kbd>\W</kbd><dd>matches any character that is not a word-constituent.

     <br><dt><kbd>\_&lt;</kbd><dd>matches the empty string, but only at the beginning of a symbol. 
A symbol is a sequence of one or more symbol-constituent characters. 
A symbol-constituent character is a character whose syntax is either
`<samp><span class="samp">w</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">_</span></samp>'.  `<samp><span class="samp">\_&lt;</span></samp>' matches at the beginning of the
buffer only if a symbol-constituent character follows.

     <br><dt><kbd>\_&gt;</kbd><dd>matches the empty string, but only at the end of a symbol.  `<samp><span class="samp">\_&gt;</span></samp>'
matches at the end of the buffer only if the contents end with a
symbol-constituent character.

     <br><dt><kbd>\s</kbd><var>c</var><dd>matches any character whose syntax is <var>c</var>.  Here <var>c</var> is a
character that designates a particular syntax class: thus, `<samp><span class="samp">w</span></samp>'
for word constituent, `<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>' or `<samp> </samp>' for whitespace, `<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>'
for ordinary punctuation, etc.  See <a href="elisp.html#Syntax-Tables">Syntax Tables</a>.

     <br><dt><kbd>\S</kbd><var>c</var><dd>matches any character whose syntax is not <var>c</var>.

     <p><a name="index-categories-of-characters-955"></a><a name="index-characters-which-belong-to-a-specific-language-956"></a><a name="index-describe_002dcategories-957"></a><br><dt><kbd>\c</kbd><var>c</var><dd>matches any character that belongs to the category <var>c</var>.  For
example, `<samp><span class="samp">\cc</span></samp>' matches Chinese characters, `<samp><span class="samp">\cg</span></samp>' matches
Greek characters, etc.  For the description of the known categories,
type <kbd>M-x describe-categories &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.

     <br><dt><kbd>\C</kbd><var>c</var><dd>matches any character that does <em>not</em> belong to category
<var>c</var>.

<p>Here is an example of a regexp&mdash;similar to the regexp that Emacs
uses, by default, to recognize the end of a sentence, not including
the following space (i.e., the variable <code>sentence-end-base</code>):

<pre class="example"><pre class="verbatim">

<h3 class="section">15.9 Lax Matching During Searching</h3>

<p><a name="index-lax-search-958"></a><a name="index-character-equivalence-in-search-959"></a>  Normally, you'd want search commands to disregard certain minor
differences between the search string you type and the text being
searched.  For example, sequences of whitespace characters of
different length are usually perceived as equivalent; letter-case
differences usually don't matter; etc.  This is known as
<dfn>character equivalence</dfn>.

   <p>This section describes the Emacs lax search features, and how to
tailor them to your needs.

   <p><a name="index-lax-space-matching-in-search-960"></a><a name="index-M_002ds-SPC-_0040r_007b_0028Incremental-search_0029_007d-961"></a><a name="index-SPC-_0040r_007b_0028Incremental-search_0029_007d-962"></a><a name="index-isearch_002dtoggle_002dlax_002dwhitespace-963"></a><a name="index-search_002dwhitespace_002dregexp-964"></a>  By default, search commands perform <dfn>lax space matching</dfn>:
each space, or sequence of spaces, matches any sequence of one or more
whitespace characters in the text.  (Incremental regexp search has a
separate default; see <a href="#Regexp-Search">Regexp Search</a>.)  Hence, `<samp><span class="samp">foo bar</span></samp>'
matches `<samp><span class="samp">foo bar</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">foo&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- /@w -->bar</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">foo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- /@w -->bar</span></samp>', and
so on (but not `<samp><span class="samp">foobar</span></samp>').  More precisely, Emacs matches each
sequence of space characters in the search string to a regular
expression specified by the variable <code>search-whitespace-regexp</code>. 
For example, to make spaces match sequences of newlines as well as
spaces, set it to `<samp><span class="samp">"[[:space:]\n]+"</span></samp>'.  The default value of this
variable depends on the buffer's major mode; most major modes classify
spaces, tabs, and formfeed characters as whitespace.

   <p>If you want whitespace characters to match exactly, you can turn lax
space matching off by typing <kbd>M-s &lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>
(<code>isearch-toggle-lax-whitespace</code>) within an incremental search. 
Another <kbd>M-s &lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> turns lax space matching back on.  To
disable lax whitespace matching for all searches, change
<code>search-whitespace-regexp</code> to <code>nil</code>; then each space in the
search string matches exactly one space.

   <p><a name="index-case-folding-in-search-965"></a><a name="index-case_002dsensitivity-and-search-966"></a>  Searches in Emacs by default ignore the case of the text they are
searching through, if you specify the search string in lower case. 
Thus, if you specify searching for `<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>', then `<samp><span class="samp">Foo</span></samp>' and
`<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>' also match.  Regexps, and in particular character sets,
behave likewise: `<samp><span class="samp">[ab]</span></samp>' matches `<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">A</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>'
or `<samp><span class="samp">B</span></samp>'.  This feature is known as <dfn>case folding</dfn>, and it is
supported in both incremental and non-incremental search modes.

   <p><a name="index-search_002dupper_002dcase-967"></a>  An upper-case letter anywhere in the search string makes the search
case-sensitive.  Thus, searching for `<samp><span class="samp">Foo</span></samp>' does not find
`<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">FOO</span></samp>'.  This applies to regular expression search
as well as to literal string search.  The effect ceases if you delete
the upper-case letter from the search string.  The variable
<code>search-upper-case</code> controls this: if it is non-<code>nil</code> (the
default), an upper-case character in the search string make the search
case-sensitive; setting it to <code>nil</code> disables this effect of
upper-case characters.

   <p><a name="index-case_002dfold_002dsearch-968"></a>  If you set the variable <code>case-fold-search</code> to <code>nil</code>, then
all letters must match exactly, including case.  This is a per-buffer
variable; altering the variable normally affects only the current buffer,
unless you change its default value.  See <a href="#Locals">Locals</a>. 
This variable applies to nonincremental searches also, including those
performed by the replace commands (see <a href="#Replace">Replace</a>) and the minibuffer
history matching commands (see <a href="#Minibuffer-History">Minibuffer History</a>).

   <p><a name="index-M_002dc-_0040r_007b_0028Incremental-search_0029_007d-969"></a><a name="index-M_002ds-c-_0040r_007b_0028Incremental-search_0029_007d-970"></a><a name="index-isearch_002dtoggle_002dcase_002dfold-971"></a>  Typing <kbd>M-c</kbd> or <kbd>M-s c</kbd> (<code>isearch-toggle-case-fold</code>)
within an incremental search toggles the case sensitivity of that
search.  The effect does not extend beyond the current incremental
search, but it does override the effect of adding or removing an
upper-case letter in the current search.

   <p>Several related variables control case-sensitivity of searching and
matching for specific commands or activities.  For instance,
<code>tags-case-fold-search</code> controls case sensitivity for
<code>find-tag</code>.  To find these variables, do <kbd>M-x
apropos-variable &lt;RET&gt; case-fold-search &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-character-folding-in-search-972"></a><a name="index-equivalent-character-sequences-973"></a>  Case folding disregards case distinctions among characters, making
upper-case characters match lower-case variants, and vice versa.  A
generalization of case folding is <dfn>character folding</dfn>, which
disregards wider classes of distinctions among similar characters. 
For instance, under character folding the letter <code>a</code> matches all
of its accented cousins like <code>&auml;</code> and <code>&aacute;</code>, i.e., the
match disregards the diacritics that distinguish these
variants.  In addition, <code>a</code> matches other characters that
resemble it, or have it as part of their graphical representation,
such as <span class="sc">u+249c parenthesized latin small letter a</span> and <span class="sc">u+2100
account of</span> (which looks like a small <code>a</code> over <code>c</code>). 
Similarly, the <acronym>ASCII</acronym> double-quote character <code>"</code> matches
all the other variants of double quotes defined by the Unicode
standard.  Finally, character folding can make a sequence of one or
more characters match another sequence of a different length: for
example, the sequence of two characters <code>ff</code> matches <span class="sc">u+fb00
latin small ligature ff</span>.  Character sequences that are not identical,
but match under character folding are known as <dfn>equivalent
character sequences</dfn>.

   <p><a name="index-M_002ds-_0027-_0040r_007b_0028Incremental-Search_0029_007d-974"></a><a name="index-isearch_002dtoggle_002dchar_002dfold-975"></a>  Generally, search commands in Emacs do not by default perform
character folding in order to match equivalent character sequences. 
You can enable this behavior by customizing the variable
<code>search-default-mode</code> to <code>char-fold-to-regexp</code>. 
See <a href="#Search-Customizations">Search Customizations</a>.  Within an incremental search, typing
<kbd>M-s '</kbd> (<code>isearch-toggle-char-fold</code>) toggles character
folding, but only for that search.  (Replace commands have a different
default, controlled by a separate option; see <a href="#Replacement-and-Lax-Matches">Replacement and Lax Matches</a>.)

   <p>Like with case folding, typing an explicit variant of a character,
such as <code>&auml;</code>, as part of the search string disables character
folding for that search.  If you delete such a character from the
search string, this effect ceases.

  Emacs provides several commands for performing search-and-replace
operations.  In addition to the simple <kbd>M-x replace-string</kbd>
command, there is <kbd>M-%</kbd> (<code>query-replace</code>), which presents
each occurrence of the search pattern and asks you whether to replace
it.

   <p>The replace commands normally operate on the text from point to the
end of the buffer.  When the region is active, they operate on it
instead (see <a href="#Mark">Mark</a>).  The basic replace commands replace one
<dfn>search string</dfn> (or regexp) with one <dfn>replacement string</dfn>.  It
is possible to perform several replacements in parallel, using the
command <code>expand-region-abbrevs</code> (see <a href="#Expanding-Abbrevs">Expanding Abbrevs</a>).

</dl>

   <p>To replace every instance of `<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>' after point with `<samp><span class="samp">bar</span></samp>',
use the command <kbd>M-x replace-string</kbd> with the two arguments
`<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">bar</span></samp>'.  Replacement happens only in the text after
point, so if you want to cover the whole buffer you must go to the
beginning first.  All occurrences up to the end of the buffer are
replaced; to limit replacement to part of the buffer, activate the
region around that part.  When the region is active, replacement is
limited to the region (see <a href="#Mark">Mark</a>).

   <p>When <code>replace-string</code> exits, it leaves point at the last
occurrence replaced.  It adds the prior position of point (where the
<code>replace-string</code> command was issued) to the mark ring, without
activating the mark; use <kbd>C-u C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> to move back there. 
See <a href="#Mark-Ring">Mark Ring</a>.

   <p>A prefix argument restricts replacement to matches that are
surrounded by word boundaries.

<h4 class="subsection">15.10.2 Regexp Replacement</h4>

<p><a name="index-replace_002dregexp-981"></a>
  The <kbd>M-x replace-string</kbd> command replaces exact matches for a
single string.  The similar command <kbd>M-x replace-regexp</kbd> replaces
any match for a specified regular expression pattern (see <a href="#Regexps">Regexps</a>).

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-x replace-regexp &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>regexp</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>newstring</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Replace every match for <var>regexp</var> with <var>newstring</var>. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-back-reference_002c-in-regexp-replacement-982"></a>  In <code>replace-regexp</code>, the <var>newstring</var> need not be constant:
it can refer to all or part of what is matched by the <var>regexp</var>. 
`<samp><span class="samp">\&amp;</span></samp>' in <var>newstring</var> stands for the entire match being
replaced.  `<samp><span class="samp">\</span><var>d</var></samp>' in <var>newstring</var>, where <var>d</var> is a
digit, stands for whatever matched the <var>d</var>th parenthesized
grouping in <var>regexp</var>.  (This is called a &ldquo;back reference&rdquo;.) 
`<samp><span class="samp">\#</span></samp>' refers to the count of replacements already made in this
command, as a decimal number.  In the first replacement, `<samp><span class="samp">\#</span></samp>'
stands for `<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>'; in the second, for `<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>'; and so on.  For
example,

<pre class="example">     M-x replace-regexp &lt;RET&gt; c[ad]+r &lt;RET&gt; \&amp;-safe &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">replaces (for example) `<samp><span class="samp">cadr</span></samp>' with `<samp><span class="samp">cadr-safe</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">cddr</span></samp>'
with `<samp><span class="samp">cddr-safe</span></samp>'.

<pre class="example">     M-x replace-regexp &lt;RET&gt; \(c[ad]+r\)-safe &lt;RET&gt; \1 &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">performs the inverse transformation.  To include a `<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>' in the
text to replace with, you must enter `<samp><span class="samp">\\</span></samp>'.

   <p>If you want to enter part of the replacement string by hand each
time, use `<samp><span class="samp">\?</span></samp>' in the replacement string.  Each replacement will
ask you to edit the replacement string in the minibuffer, putting
point where the `<samp><span class="samp">\?</span></samp>' was.

   <p>The remainder of this subsection is intended for specialized tasks
and requires knowledge of Lisp.  Most readers can skip it.

   <p>You can use Lisp expressions to calculate parts of the
replacement string.  To do this, write `<samp><span class="samp">\,</span></samp>' followed by the
expression in the replacement string.  Each replacement calculates the
value of the expression and converts it to text without quoting (if
it's a string, this means using the string's contents), and uses it in
the replacement string in place of the expression itself.  If the
expression is a symbol, one space in the replacement string after the
symbol name goes with the symbol name, so the value replaces them
both.

   <p>Inside such an expression, you can use some special sequences. 
`<samp><span class="samp">\&amp;</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">\</span><var>n</var></samp>' refer here, as usual, to the entire
match as a string, and to a submatch as a string.  <var>n</var> may be
multiple digits, and the value of `<samp><span class="samp">\</span><var>n</var></samp>' is <code>nil</code> if
subexpression <var>n</var> did not match.  You can also use `<samp><span class="samp">\#&amp;</span></samp>' and
`<samp><span class="samp">\#</span><var>n</var></samp>' to refer to those matches as numbers (this is valid
when the match or submatch has the form of a numeral).  `<samp><span class="samp">\#</span></samp>' here
too stands for the number of already-completed replacements.

   <p>Repeating our example to exchange `<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>', we can thus
do it also this way:

<pre class="example">     M-x replace-regexp &lt;RET&gt; \(x\)\|y &lt;RET&gt;
     \,(if \1 "y" "x") &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>
   <p>For computing replacement strings for `<samp><span class="samp">\,</span></samp>', the <code>format</code>
function is often useful (see <a href="elisp.html#Formatting-Strings">Formatting Strings</a>).  For example, to add consecutively numbered
strings like `<samp><span class="samp">ABC00042</span></samp>' to columns 73 to&nbsp;80<!-- /@w --> (unless they are
already occupied), you can use

<pre class="example">     M-x replace-regexp &lt;RET&gt; ^.\{0,72\}$ &lt;RET&gt;
     \,(format "%-72sABC%05d" \&amp; \#) &lt;RET&gt;

<h4 class="subsection">15.10.3 Replace Commands and Lax Matches</h4>

<p>This subsection describes the behavior of replace commands with
respect to lax matches (see <a href="#Lax-Search">Lax Search</a>) and how to customize it. 
In general, replace commands mostly default to stricter matching than
their search counterparts.

   <p><a name="index-lax-space-matching-in-replace-commands-983"></a><a name="index-replace_002dlax_002dwhitespace-984"></a>  Unlike incremental search, the replacement commands do not use lax
space matching (see <a href="#Lax-Search">lax space matching</a>) by default. 
To enable lax space matching for replacement, change the variable
<code>replace-lax-whitespace</code> to non-<code>nil</code>.  (This only affects
how Emacs finds the text to replace, not the replacement text.)

   <p><a name="index-replace_002dregexp_002dlax_002dwhitespace-985"></a>  A companion variable <code>replace-regexp-lax-whitespace</code> controls
whether <code>query-replace-regexp</code> uses lax whitespace matching when
searching for patterns.

   <p><a name="index-case-folding-in-replace-commands-986"></a>  If the first argument of a replace command is all lower case, the
command ignores case while searching for occurrences to
replace&mdash;provided <code>case-fold-search</code> is non-<code>nil</code>.  If
<code>case-fold-search</code> is set to <code>nil</code>, case is always significant
in all searches.

   <p><a name="index-case_002dreplace-987"></a>  In addition, when the <var>newstring</var> argument is all or partly lower
case, replacement commands try to preserve the case pattern of each
occurrence.  Thus, the command

<pre class="example">     M-x replace-string &lt;RET&gt; foo &lt;RET&gt; bar &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">replaces a lower case `<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>' with a lower case `<samp><span class="samp">bar</span></samp>', an
all-caps `<samp><span class="samp">FOO</span></samp>' with `<samp><span class="samp">BAR</span></samp>', and a capitalized `<samp><span class="samp">Foo</span></samp>' with
`<samp><span class="samp">Bar</span></samp>'.  (These three alternatives&mdash;lower case, all caps, and
capitalized, are the only ones that <code>replace-string</code> can
distinguish.)

   <p>If upper-case letters are used in the replacement string, they remain
upper case every time that text is inserted.  If upper-case letters are
used in the first argument, the second argument is always substituted
exactly as given, with no case conversion.  Likewise, if either
<code>case-replace</code> or <code>case-fold-search</code> is set to <code>nil</code>,
replacement is done without case conversion.

   <p><a name="index-character-folding-in-replace-commands-988"></a>  The replacement commands by default do not use character folding
(see <a href="#Lax-Search">character folding</a>) when looking for the text to
replace.  To enable character folding for matching in
<code>query-replace</code> and <code>replace-string</code>, set the variable
<code>replace-char-fold</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> value.  (This
setting does not affect the replacement text, only how Emacs finds the
text to replace.  It also doesn't affect <code>replace-regexp</code>.)

</dl>

   <p><a name="index-M_002d_0025-990"></a><a name="index-query_002dreplace-991"></a>  If you want to change only some of the occurrences of `<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>' to
`<samp><span class="samp">bar</span></samp>', not all of them, use <kbd>M-%</kbd> (<code>query-replace</code>). 
This command finds occurrences of `<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>' one by one, displays each
occurrence and asks you whether to replace it.  Aside from querying,
<code>query-replace</code> works just like <code>replace-string</code>
(see <a href="#Unconditional-Replace">Unconditional Replace</a>).  In particular, it preserves case
provided <code>case-replace</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, as it normally is
(see <a href="#Replacement-and-Lax-Matches">Replacement and Lax Matches</a>).  A numeric argument means to
consider only occurrences that are bounded by word-delimiter
characters.  A negative prefix argument replaces backward.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dM_002d_0025-992"></a><a name="index-query_002dreplace_002dregexp-993"></a>  <kbd>C-M-%</kbd> performs regexp search and replace (<code>query-replace-regexp</code>). 
It works like <code>replace-regexp</code> except that it queries
like <code>query-replace</code>.

   <p><a name="index-query_002dreplace_002dfrom_002dto_002dseparator-994"></a>  You can reuse earlier replacements with these commands.  When
<code>query-replace</code> or <code>query-replace-regexp</code> prompts for the
search string, use <kbd>M-p</kbd> and <kbd>M-n</kbd> to show previous
replacements in the form `<samp><var>from</var><span class="samp"> -&gt; </span><var>to</var></samp>', where
<var>from</var> is the search pattern, <var>to</var> is its replacement, and the
separator between them is determined by the value of the variable
<code>query-replace-from-to-separator</code>.  Type &lt;RET&gt; to select the
desired replacement.

   <p><a name="index-faces-for-highlighting-query-replace-995"></a><a name="index-query_002dreplace-face-996"></a><a name="index-lazy_002dhighlight-face_002c-in-replace-997"></a><a name="index-query_002dreplace_002dhighlight-998"></a><a name="index-query_002dreplace_002dlazy_002dhighlight-999"></a><a name="index-query_002dreplace_002dshow_002dreplacement-1000"></a>  These commands highlight the current match using the face
<code>query-replace</code>.  You can disable this highlight by setting the
variable <code>query-replace-highlight</code> to <code>nil</code>.  They highlight
other matches using <code>lazy-highlight</code> just like incremental search
(see <a href="#Incremental-Search">Incremental Search</a>); this can be disabled by setting
<code>query-replace-lazy-highlight</code> to <code>nil</code>.  By default,
<code>query-replace-regexp</code> will show the substituted replacement
string for the current match in the minibuffer.  If you want to keep
special sequences `<samp><span class="samp">\&amp;</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">\</span><var>n</var></samp>' unexpanded, customize
<code>query-replace-show-replacement</code> variable.

   <p><a name="index-query_002dreplace_002dskip_002dread_002donly-1001"></a>  The variable <code>query-replace-skip-read-only</code>, if set
non-<code>nil</code>, will cause replacement commands to ignore matches in
read-only text.  The default is not to ignore them.

   <p>The characters you can type when you are shown a match for the string
or regexp are:

<!-- WideCommands -->
<dl>
<dt><kbd>&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd><dt><kbd>y</kbd><dd>to replace the occurrence with <var>newstring</var>.

     <br><dt><kbd>&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd><dt><kbd>&lt;Delete&gt;</kbd><dt><kbd>&lt;BACKSPACE&gt;</kbd><dt><kbd>n</kbd><dd>to skip to the next occurrence without replacing this one.

     <br><dt><kbd>, </kbd><span class="roman">(Comma)</span><dd>to replace this occurrence and display the result.  You are then asked
for another input character to say what to do next.  Since the
replacement has already been made, &lt;DEL&gt; and &lt;SPC&gt; are
equivalent in this situation; both move to the next occurrence.

     <p>You can type <kbd>C-r</kbd> at this point (see below) to alter the replaced
text.  You can also type <kbd>C-x u</kbd> to undo the replacement; this exits
the <code>query-replace</code>, so if you want to do further replacement you
must use <kbd>C-x &lt;ESC&gt; &lt;ESC&gt; &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> to restart
(see <a href="#Repetition">Repetition</a>).

     <br><dt><kbd>&lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dt><kbd>q</kbd><dd>to exit without doing any more replacements.

     <br><dt><kbd>. </kbd><span class="roman">(Period)</span><dd>to replace this occurrence and then exit without searching for more
occurrences.

     <br><dt><kbd>!</kbd><dd>to replace all remaining occurrences without asking again.

     <br><dt><kbd>^</kbd><dd>to go back to the position of the previous occurrence (or what used to
be an occurrence), in case you changed it by mistake or want to
reexamine it.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-r</kbd><dd>to enter a recursive editing level, in case the occurrence needs to be
edited rather than just replaced with <var>newstring</var>.  When you are
done, exit the recursive editing level with <kbd>C-M-c</kbd> to proceed to
the next occurrence.  See <a href="#Recursive-Edit">Recursive Edit</a>.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-w</kbd><dd>to delete the occurrence, and then enter a recursive editing level as in
<kbd>C-r</kbd>.  Use the recursive edit to insert text to replace the deleted
occurrence of <var>string</var>.  When done, exit the recursive editing level
with <kbd>C-M-c</kbd> to proceed to the next occurrence.

     <br><dt><kbd>e</kbd><dd>to edit the replacement string in the minibuffer.  When you exit the
minibuffer by typing &lt;RET&gt;, the minibuffer contents replace the
current occurrence of the pattern.  They also become the new
replacement string for any further occurrences.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-l</kbd><dd>to redisplay the screen.  Then you must type another character to
specify what to do with this occurrence.

     <br><dt><kbd>Y </kbd><span class="roman">(Upper-case)</span><dd>to replace all remaining occurrences in all remaining buffers in
multi-buffer replacements (like the Dired &lt;Q&gt; command that performs
query replace on selected files).  It answers this question and all
subsequent questions in the series with &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, without further
user interaction.

     <br><dt><kbd>N </kbd><span class="roman">(Upper-case)</span><dd>to skip to the next buffer in multi-buffer replacements without
replacing remaining occurrences in the current buffer.  It answers
this question &ldquo;no&rdquo;, gives up on the questions for the current buffer,
and continues to the next buffer in the sequence.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-h</kbd><dt><kbd>?</kbd><dt><kbd>&lt;F1&gt;</kbd><dd>to display a message summarizing these options.  Then you must type
another character to specify what to do with this occurrence. 
</dl>

   <p>Aside from this, any other character exits the <code>query-replace</code>,
and is then reread as part of a key sequence.  Thus, if you type
<kbd>C-k</kbd>, it exits the <code>query-replace</code> and then kills to end of
line.  In particular, <kbd>C-g</kbd> simply exits the <code>query-replace</code>.

   <p>To restart a <code>query-replace</code> once it is exited, use <kbd>C-x
&lt;ESC&gt; &lt;ESC&gt;</kbd>, which repeats the <code>query-replace</code> because it
used the minibuffer to read its arguments.  See <a href="#Repetition">C-x ESC ESC</a>.

   <p><a name="index-invisible-text_002c-and-query_002dreplace-1002"></a>  The option <code>search-invisible</code> determines how <code>query-replace</code>
treats invisible text.  See <a href="#Outline-Search">Outline Search</a>.

   <p>See <a href="#Operating-on-Files">Operating on Files</a>, for the Dired <kbd>Q</kbd> command which
performs query replace on selected files.  See also <a href="#Transforming-File-Names">Transforming File Names</a>, for Dired commands to rename, copy, or link files by
replacing regexp matches in file names.

<h3 class="section">15.11 Other Search-and-Loop Commands</h3>

<p>Here are some other commands that find matches for a regular
expression.  They all ignore case in matching, if the pattern contains
no upper-case letters and <code>case-fold-search</code> is non-<code>nil</code>. 
Aside from <code>occur</code> and its variants, all operate on the text from
point to the end of the buffer, or on the region if it is active.

matching that regexp.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x multi-isearch-files-regexp</kbd><dd>This command is just like <code>multi-isearch-files</code>, except it

     <p>In some modes that set the buffer-local variable

a multi-file incremental search is activated automatically.

highlighted using the <code>match</code> face.  To limit the search to part
of the buffer, narrow to that part (see <a href="#Narrowing">Narrowing</a>).  A numeric
argument <var>n</var> specifies that <var>n</var> lines of context are to be

context lines is specified by the variable
<code>list-matching-lines-default-context-lines</code>.

in another window; <kbd>C-o</kbd> does not select it.  Alternatively, you
can use the <kbd>C-x `</kbd> (<code>next-error</code>) command to visit the

mode.

     <p>The command <kbd>M-x list-matching-lines</kbd> is a synonym for <kbd>M-x

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x multi-occur</kbd><dd>This command is just like <code>occur</code>, except it is able to search
through multiple buffers.  It asks you to specify the buffer names one

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x multi-occur-in-matching-buffers</kbd><dd>This command is similar to <code>multi-occur</code>, except the buffers to

match buffer names instead.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x how-many</kbd><dd>Prompt for a regexp, and print the number of matches for it in the

region instead.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x flush-lines</kbd><dd>Prompt for a regexp, and delete each line that contains a match for
it, operating on the text after point.  This command deletes the
current line if it contains a match starting after point.  If the
region is active, it operates on the region instead; if a line
partially contained in the region contains a match entirely contained
in the region, it is deleted.

     <p>If a match is split across lines, <code>flush-lines</code> deletes all those
lines.  It deletes the lines before starting to look for the next
match; hence, it ignores a match starting on the same line at which
another match ended.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x keep-lines</kbd><dd>Prompt for a regexp, and delete each line that <em>does not</em> contain
a match for it, operating on the text after point.  If point is not at
the beginning of a line, this command always keeps the current line. 
If the region is active, the command operates on the region instead;
it never deletes lines that are only partially contained in the region
(a newline that ends a line counts as part of that line).

     <p>If a match is split across lines, this command keeps all those lines.

<h3 class="section">15.12 Tailoring Search to Your Needs</h3>

<p><a name="index-search-customizations-1020"></a>
  This section describes miscellaneous search-related customizations
not described elsewhere.

   <p><a name="index-default-search-mode-1021"></a><a name="index-search-mode_002c-default-1022"></a>  The default search mode for the incremental search is specified by
the variable <code>search-default-mode</code>.  It can be <code>nil</code>,
<code>t</code>, or a function.  If it is <code>nil</code>, the default mode is to
do literal searches without character folding, but with case folding
and lax-whitespace matches as determined by <code>case-fold-search</code>
and <code>search-whitespace-regexp</code>, respectively (see <a href="#Lax-Search">Lax Search</a>).  If the value is <code>t</code>, incremental search defaults to
regexp searches.  The default value specifies a function that only
performs case folding and lax-whitespace matching.

   <p><a name="index-search_002dhighlight-1023"></a>  The current match of an on-going incremental search is highlighted
using the <code>isearch</code> face.  This highlighting can be disabled by
setting the variable <code>search-highlight</code> to <code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-lazy-highlighting-customizations-1024"></a><a name="index-isearch_002dlazy_002dhighlight-1025"></a><a name="index-lazy_002dhighlight-face-1026"></a>  The other matches for the search string that are visible on display
are highlighted using the <code>lazy-highlight</code> face.  Setting the
variable <code>isearch-lazy-highlight</code> to <code>nil</code> disables this
highlighting.  Here are some other variables that customize the lazy
highlighting:

     <dl>
<dt><code>lazy-highlight-initial-delay</code><dd>Time in seconds to wait before highlighting visible matches.

     <br><dt><code>lazy-highlight-interval</code><dd>Time in seconds between highlighting successive matches.

     <br><dt><code>lazy-highlight-max-at-a-time</code><dd>The maximum number of matches to highlight before checking for input. 
A large number can take some time to highlight, so if you want to
continue searching and type <kbd>C-s</kbd> or <kbd>C-r</kbd> during that time,
Emacs will not respond until it finishes highlighting all those
matches.  Thus, smaller values make Emacs more responsive. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-search_002dnonincremental_002dinstead-1027"></a>  Normally, entering &lt;RET&gt; within incremental search when the
search string is empty launches a nonincremental search.  (Actually,
it lets you edit the search string, and the next &lt;RET&gt; does the
search.)  However, if you customize the variable
<code>search-nonincremental-instead</code> to <code>nil</code>, typing &lt;RET&gt;
will always exit the incremental search, even if the search string is
empty.

   <p><a name="index-isearch_002dhide_002dimmediately-1028"></a>  By default, incremental search and query-replace commands match
invisible text, but hide any such matches as soon as the current match
moves off the invisible text.  If you customize the variable
<code>isearch-hide-immediately</code> to <code>nil</code>, any invisible text
where matches were found stays on display until the search or the
replace command exits.

   <p><a name="index-search-display-on-slow-terminals-1029"></a><a name="index-search_002dslow_002dspeed-1030"></a><a name="index-search_002dslow_002dwindow_002dlines-1031"></a>  Searching incrementally on slow terminals, such as displays
connected to remote machines over slow connection, could be annoying
due to the need to redraw large portions of the display as the search
proceeds.  Emacs provides a special display mode for slow terminals,
whereby search pops up a separate small window and displays the text
surrounding the match in that window.  Small windows display faster,
so the annoying effect of slow speed is alleviated.  The variable
<code>search-slow-speed</code> determines the baud rate threshold below
which Emacs will use this display mode.  The variable
<code>search-slow-window-lines</code> controls the number of lines in the
window Emacs pops up for displaying the search results; the default is
1 line.  Normally, this window will pop up at the bottom of the window
that displays the buffer where you start searching, bit if the value
of <code>search-slow-window-lines</code> is negative, that means to put the
window at the top and give it the number of lines that is the absolute
value of that value.

<h2 class="chapter">16 Commands for Fixing Typos</h2>

<p><a name="index-typos_002c-fixing-1032"></a><a name="index-mistakes_002c-correcting-1033"></a>
  In this chapter we describe commands that are useful when you catch
a mistake while editing.  The most fundamental of these commands is
the undo command <kbd>C-/</kbd> (also bound to <kbd>C-x u</kbd> and <kbd>C-_</kbd>). 
This undoes a single command, or a
part of a command (as in the case of <code>query-replace</code>), or several
consecutive character insertions.  Consecutive repetitions of
<kbd>C-/</kbd> undo earlier and earlier changes, back to the limit of the
undo information available.

   <p>Aside from the commands described here, you can erase text using
deletion commands such as &lt;DEL&gt; (<code>delete-backward-char</code>). 
These were described earlier in this manual.  See <a href="#Erasing">Erasing</a>.

<ul class="menu">

<h3 class="section">16.1 Undo</h3>

<p><a name="index-undo-1034"></a><a name="index-changes_002c-undoing-1035"></a>
  The <dfn>undo</dfn> command reverses recent changes in the buffer's text. 
Each buffer records changes individually, and the undo command always
applies to the current buffer.  You can undo all the changes in a
buffer for as far back as the buffer's records go.  Usually, each editing
command makes a separate entry in the undo records, but some commands
such as <code>query-replace</code> divide their changes into multiple
entries for flexibility in undoing.  Consecutive character insertion
commands are usually grouped together into a single undo record, to
make undoing less tedious.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-/</kbd><dt><kbd>C-x u</kbd><dt><kbd>C-_</kbd><dd>Undo one entry in the current buffer's undo records (<code>undo</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-u-1036"></a><a name="index-C_002d_005f-1037"></a><a name="index-C_002d_002f-1038"></a><a name="index-undo-1039"></a>  To begin to undo, type <kbd>C-/</kbd> (or its aliases, <kbd>C-_</kbd> or
<kbd>C-x u</kbd>)<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-6" name="fnd-6"><sup>6</sup></a>.  This undoes the most recent change in the buffer,
and moves point back to where it was before that change. 
  Consecutive repetitions of <kbd>C-/</kbd> (or its aliases) undo earlier
and earlier changes in the current buffer.  If all the recorded
changes have already been undone, the undo command signals an error.

   <p><a name="index-redo-1040"></a><a name="index-undo_002donly-1041"></a>  Any command other than an undo command breaks the sequence of undo
commands.  Starting from that moment, the entire sequence of undo
commands that you have just performed are themselves placed into the
undo record, as a single set of changes.  Therefore, to re-apply
changes you have undone, type <kbd>C-f</kbd> or any other command that
harmlessly breaks the sequence of undoing; then type <kbd>C-/</kbd> to undo
the undo command.

   <p>Alternatively, if you want to resume undoing, without redoing
previous undo commands, use <kbd>M-x undo-only</kbd>.  This is like
<code>undo</code>, but will not redo changes you have just undone.

<!-- What about @kbd{M-x revert-buffer}? -xfq -->
<p>If you notice that a buffer has been modified accidentally, the
easiest way to recover is to type <kbd>C-/</kbd> repeatedly until the stars
disappear from the front of the mode line (see <a href="#Mode-Line">Mode Line</a>). 
Whenever an undo command makes the stars disappear from the mode line,
it means that the buffer contents are the same as they were when the
file was last read in or saved.  If you do not remember whether you
changed the buffer deliberately, type <kbd>C-/</kbd> once.  When you see
the last change you made undone, you will see whether it was an
intentional change.  If it was an accident, leave it undone.  If it
was deliberate, redo the change as described above.

   <p><a name="index-selective-undo-1042"></a><a name="index-C_002du-C_002d_002f-1043"></a>  When there is an active region, any use of <code>undo</code> performs
<dfn>selective undo</dfn>: it undoes the most recent change within the
region, instead of the entire buffer.  However, when Transient Mark
mode is off (see <a href="#Disabled-Transient-Mark">Disabled Transient Mark</a>), <kbd>C-/</kbd> always
operates on the entire buffer, ignoring the region.  In this case, you
can perform selective undo by supplying a prefix argument to the
<code>undo</code> command: <kbd>C-u C-/</kbd>.  To undo further changes in the
same region, repeat the <code>undo</code> command (no prefix argument is
needed).

   <p>Some specialized buffers do not make undo records.  Buffers whose
names start with spaces never do; these buffers are used internally by
Emacs to hold text that users don't normally look at or edit.

   <p><a name="index-undo_002dlimit-1044"></a><a name="index-undo_002dstrong_002dlimit-1045"></a><a name="index-undo_002douter_002dlimit-1046"></a><a name="index-undo-limit-1047"></a>  When the undo information for a buffer becomes too large, Emacs discards
the oldest records from time to time (during <dfn>garbage
collection</dfn>).  You can specify how much undo information to keep by
setting the variables <code>undo-limit</code>, <code>undo-strong-limit</code>, and
<code>undo-outer-limit</code>.  Their values are expressed in bytes.

   <p>The variable <code>undo-limit</code> sets a soft limit: Emacs keeps undo
data for enough commands to reach this size, and perhaps exceed it,
but does not keep data for any earlier commands beyond that.  Its
default value is 80000.  The variable <code>undo-strong-limit</code> sets a
stricter limit: any previous command (though not the most recent one)
that pushes the size past this amount is forgotten.  The default value
of <code>undo-strong-limit</code> is 120000.

   <p>Regardless of the values of those variables, the most recent change
is never discarded unless it gets bigger than <code>undo-outer-limit</code>
(normally 12,000,000).  At that point, Emacs discards the undo data and
warns you about it.  This is the only situation in which you cannot
undo the last command.  If this happens, you can increase the value of
<code>undo-outer-limit</code> to make it even less likely to happen in the
future.  But if you didn't expect the command to create such large
undo data, then it is probably a bug and you should report it.

<h3 class="section">16.2 Transposing Text</h3>

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-t</kbd><dd>Transpose two characters (<code>transpose-chars</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-t</kbd><dd>Transpose two words (<code>transpose-words</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-M-t</kbd><dd>Transpose two balanced expressions (<code>transpose-sexps</code>).

</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dt-1048"></a><a name="index-transpose_002dchars-1049"></a>  The common error of transposing two characters can be fixed, when they
are adjacent, with the <kbd>C-t</kbd> command (<code>transpose-chars</code>).  Normally,
<kbd>C-t</kbd> transposes the two characters on either side of point.  When
given at the end of a line, rather than transposing the last character of
the line with the newline, which would be useless, <kbd>C-t</kbd> transposes the
last two characters on the line.  So, if you catch your transposition error
right away, you can fix it with just a <kbd>C-t</kbd>.  If you don't catch it so
fast, you must move the cursor back between the two transposed
characters before you type <kbd>C-t</kbd>.  If you transposed a space with
the last character of the word before it, the word motion commands are
a good way of getting there.  Otherwise, a reverse search (<kbd>C-r</kbd>)
is often the best way.  See <a href="#Search">Search</a>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dt-1050"></a><a name="index-transpose_002dlines-1051"></a><a name="index-M_002dt-1052"></a><a name="index-transpose_002dwords-1053"></a><!-- Don't index C-M-t and transpose-sexps here, they are indexed in -->
<!-- programs.texi, in the "List Commands" node. -->
<!-- @kindex C-M-t -->
<!-- @findex transpose-sexps -->
  <kbd>M-t</kbd> transposes the word before point with the word after point
(<code>transpose-words</code>).  It moves point forward over a word,
dragging the word preceding or containing point forward as well.  The
punctuation characters between the words do not move.  For example,
`<samp><span class="samp">FOO,&nbsp;BAR</span></samp>'<!-- /@w --> transposes into `<samp><span class="samp">BAR,&nbsp;FOO</span></samp>'<!-- /@w --> rather than
`<samp><span class="samp">BAR&nbsp;FOO,<!-- /@w --></span></samp>'.

   <p><kbd>C-M-t</kbd> (<code>transpose-sexps</code>) is a similar command for
transposing two expressions (see <a href="#Expressions">Expressions</a>), and <kbd>C-x C-t</kbd>
(<code>transpose-lines</code>) exchanges lines.  They work like <kbd>M-t</kbd>
except as regards what units of text they transpose.

   <p>A numeric argument to a transpose command serves as a repeat count: it
tells the transpose command to move the character (word, expression, line)
before or containing point across several other characters (words,
expressions, lines).  For example, <kbd>C-u 3 C-t</kbd> moves the character before
point forward across three other characters.  It would change
`<samp><span class="samp">f-!-oobar</span></samp>' into `<samp><span class="samp">oobf-!-ar</span></samp>'.  This is equivalent to
repeating <kbd>C-t</kbd> three times.  <kbd>C-u - 4 M-t</kbd> moves the word
before point backward across four words.  <kbd>C-u - C-M-t</kbd> would cancel
the effect of plain <kbd>C-M-t</kbd>.

   <p>A numeric argument of zero is assigned a special meaning (because
otherwise a command with a repeat count of zero would do nothing): to
transpose the character (word, expression, line) ending after point
with the one ending after the mark.

the word case-conversion commands <kbd>M-l</kbd>, <kbd>M-u</kbd> and <kbd>M-c</kbd> have a
special feature when used with a negative argument: they do not move the

  This section describes the commands to check the spelling of a
single word or of a portion of a buffer.  These commands only work if
the spelling checker program Aspell, Ispell or Hunspell is installed. 
These programs are not part of Emacs, but one of them is usually
installed in GNU/Linux and other free operating systems. 
See <a href="aspell.html#Top">Aspell</a>.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-$</kbd><dd>Check and correct spelling of the word at point (<code>ispell-word</code>). 
If the region is active, do it for all words in the region instead. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x ispell</kbd><dd>Check and correct spelling of all words in the buffer.  If the region
is active, do it for all words in the region instead. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x ispell-buffer</kbd><dd>Check and correct spelling in the buffer. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x ispell-region</kbd><dd>Check and correct spelling in the region. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x ispell-message</kbd><dd>Check and correct spelling in a draft mail message, excluding cited
material. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x ispell-change-dictionary &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>dict</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Restart the Aspell/Ispell/Hunspell process, using <var>dict</var> as the dictionary. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x ispell-kill-ispell</kbd><dd>Kill the Aspell/Ispell/Hunspell subprocess. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd><dt><kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; &lt;TAB&gt;</kbd><dd>Complete the word before point based on the spelling dictionary
(<code>ispell-complete-word</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x flyspell-mode</kbd><dd>Enable Flyspell mode, which highlights all misspelled words. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x flyspell-prog-mode</kbd><dd>Enable Flyspell mode for comments and strings only. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-M_002d_0024-1060"></a><a name="index-ispell_002dword-1061"></a>  To check the spelling of the word around or before point, and
optionally correct it as well, type <kbd>M-$</kbd> (<code>ispell-word</code>). 
If a region is active, <kbd>M-$</kbd> checks the spelling of all words
within the region.  See <a href="#Mark">Mark</a>.  (When Transient Mark mode is off,
<kbd>M-$</kbd> always acts on the word around or before point, ignoring the
region; see <a href="#Disabled-Transient-Mark">Disabled Transient Mark</a>.)

   <p><a name="index-ispell-1062"></a><a name="index-ispell_002dbuffer-1063"></a><a name="index-ispell_002dregion-1064"></a><a name="index-spell_002dchecking-the-active-region-1065"></a>  Similarly, the command <kbd>M-x ispell</kbd> performs spell-checking in
the region if one is active, or in the entire buffer otherwise.  The
commands <kbd>M-x ispell-buffer</kbd> and <kbd>M-x ispell-region</kbd>
explicitly perform spell-checking on the entire buffer or the region
respectively.  To check spelling in an email message you are writing,
use <kbd>M-x ispell-message</kbd>; that command checks the whole buffer,
except for material that is indented or appears to be cited from other
messages.  See <a href="#Sending-Mail">Sending Mail</a>.

   <p>When one of these commands encounters what appears to be an
incorrect word, it asks you what to do.  It usually displays a list of
numbered <dfn>near-misses</dfn>&mdash;words that are close to the incorrect word. 
Then you must type a single-character response.  Here are the valid
responses:

     <dl>
<dt><var>digit</var><dd>Replace the word, just this time, with one of the displayed
near-misses.  Each near-miss is listed with a digit; type that digit
to select it.

     <br><dt><kbd>&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd><dd>Skip this word&mdash;continue to consider it incorrect, but don't change it
here.

     <br><dt><kbd>r </kbd><var>new</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Replace the word, just this time, with <var>new</var>.  (The replacement
string will be rescanned for more spelling errors.)

     <br><dt><kbd>R </kbd><var>new</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Replace the word with <var>new</var>, and do a <code>query-replace</code> so you
can replace it elsewhere in the buffer if you wish.  (The replacements
will be rescanned for more spelling errors.)

     <br><dt><kbd>a</kbd><dd>Accept the incorrect word&mdash;treat it as correct, but only in this
editing session.

     <br><dt><kbd>A</kbd><dd>Accept the incorrect word&mdash;treat it as correct, but only in this
editing session and for this buffer.

     <br><dt><kbd>i</kbd><dd>Insert this word in your private dictionary file so that Aspell or Ispell
or Hunspell will consider it correct from now on, even in future sessions.

     <br><dt><kbd>m</kbd><dd>Like <kbd>i</kbd>, but you can also specify dictionary completion
information.

     <br><dt><kbd>u</kbd><dd>Insert the lower-case version of this word in your private dictionary
file.

     <br><dt><kbd>l </kbd><var>word</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Look in the dictionary for words that match <var>word</var>.  These words
become the new list of near-misses; you can select one of them as
the replacement by typing a digit.  You can use `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' in <var>word</var> as a
wildcard.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-g</kbd><dt><kbd>X</kbd><dd>Quit interactive spell checking, leaving point at the word that was
being checked.  You can restart checking again afterward with <kbd>C-u
M-$</kbd>.

     <br><dt><kbd>x</kbd><dd>Quit interactive spell checking and move point back to where it was
when you started spell checking.

     <br><dt><kbd>q</kbd><dd>Quit interactive spell checking and kill the spell-checker subprocess.

     <br><dt><kbd>?</kbd><dd>Show the list of options. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-ispell_002dcomplete_002dword-1066"></a>  In Text mode and related modes, <kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>
(<code>ispell-complete-word</code>) performs in-buffer completion based on
spelling correction.  Insert the beginning of a word, and then type
<kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>; this shows a list of completions.  (If your
window manager intercepts <kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>, type <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt;
&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> or <kbd>C-M-i</kbd>.)  Each completion is listed with a digit or
character; type that digit or character to choose it.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bispell_007d-program-1067"></a><a name="index-ispell_002dkill_002dispell-1068"></a>  Once started, the Aspell or Ispell or Hunspell subprocess continues
to run, waiting for something to do, so that subsequent spell checking
commands complete more quickly.  If you want to get rid of the
process, use <kbd>M-x ispell-kill-ispell</kbd>.  This is not usually
necessary, since the process uses no processor time except when you do
spelling correction.

   <p><a name="index-ispell_002ddictionary-1069"></a><a name="index-ispell_002dlocal_002ddictionary-1070"></a><a name="index-ispell_002dpersonal_002ddictionary-1071"></a><a name="index-ispell_002dchange_002ddictionary-1072"></a>  Ispell, Aspell and Hunspell look up spelling in two dictionaries:
the standard dictionary and your personal dictionary.  The standard
dictionary is specified by the variable <code>ispell-local-dictionary</code>
or, if that is <code>nil</code>, by the variable <code>ispell-dictionary</code>. 
If both are <code>nil</code>, the spelling program's default dictionary is
used.  The command <kbd>M-x ispell-change-dictionary</kbd> sets the
standard dictionary for the buffer and then restarts the subprocess,
so that it will use a different standard dictionary.  Your personal
dictionary is specified by the variable
<code>ispell-personal-dictionary</code>.  If that is <code>nil</code>, the
spelling program looks for a personal dictionary in a default
location.

   <p><a name="index-ispell_002dcomplete_002dword_002ddict-1073"></a>  A separate dictionary is used for word completion.  The variable
<code>ispell-complete-word-dict</code> specifies the file name of this
dictionary.  The completion dictionary must be different because it
cannot use root and affix information.  For some languages, there
is a spell checking dictionary but no word completion dictionary.

   <p><a name="index-Flyspell-mode-1074"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Flyspell-1075"></a><a name="index-flyspell_002dmode-1076"></a>  Flyspell mode is a minor mode that performs automatic spell checking
as you type.  When it finds a word that it does not recognize, it
highlights that word.  Type <kbd>M-x flyspell-mode</kbd> to toggle Flyspell
mode in the current buffer.  To enable Flyspell mode in all text mode
buffers, add <code>flyspell-mode</code> to <code>text-mode-hook</code>. 
See <a href="#Hooks">Hooks</a>.

   <p><a name="index-flyspell_002dcorrect_002dword-1077"></a><a name="index-flyspell_002dauto_002dcorrect_002dword-1078"></a><a name="index-flyspell_002dcorrect_002dword_002dbefore_002dpoint-1079"></a>  When Flyspell mode highlights a word as misspelled, you can click on
it with <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> (<code>flyspell-correct-word</code>) to display a menu
of possible corrections and actions.  In addition, <kbd>C-.</kbd> or
<kbd>&lt;ESC&gt;-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> (<code>flyspell-auto-correct-word</code>) will
propose various successive corrections for the word at point, and
<kbd>C-c $</kbd> (<code>flyspell-correct-word-before-point</code>) will pop up a
menu of possible corrections.  Of course, you can always correct the
misspelled word by editing it manually in any way you like.

   <p><a name="index-flyspell_002dprog_002dmode-1080"></a>  Flyspell Prog mode works just like ordinary Flyspell mode, except
that it only checks words in comments and string constants.  This
feature is useful for editing programs.  Type <kbd>M-x
flyspell-prog-mode</kbd> to enable or disable this mode in the current
buffer.  To enable this mode in all programming mode buffers, add
<code>flyspell-prog-mode</code> to <code>prog-mode-hook</code> (see <a href="#Hooks">Hooks</a>).

<h2 class="chapter">17 Keyboard Macros</h2>

<p><a name="index-defining-keyboard-macros-1081"></a><a name="index-keyboard-macro-1082"></a>
  In this chapter we describe how to record a sequence of editing
commands so you can repeat it conveniently later.

   <p>A <dfn>keyboard macro</dfn> is a command defined by an Emacs user to stand for
another sequence of keys.  For example, if you discover that you are
about to type <kbd>C-n M-d C-d</kbd> forty times, you can speed your work by
defining a keyboard macro to do <kbd>C-n M-d C-d</kbd>, and then executing
it 39 more times.

   <p>You define a keyboard macro by executing and recording the commands
which are its definition.  Put differently, as you define a keyboard
macro, the definition is being executed for the first time.  This way,
you can see the effects of your commands, so that you don't have to
figure them out in your head.  When you close the definition, the
keyboard macro is defined and also has been, in effect, executed once. 
You can then do the whole thing over again by invoking the macro.

   <p>Keyboard macros differ from ordinary Emacs commands in that they are
written in the Emacs command language rather than in Lisp.  This makes it
easier for the novice to write them, and makes them more convenient as
temporary hacks.  However, the Emacs command language is not powerful
enough as a programming language to be useful for writing anything
intelligent or general.  For such things, Lisp must be used.

From then on,
your keys continue to be executed, but also become part of the
definition of the macro.  `<samp><span class="samp">Def</span></samp>' appears in the mode line to
remind you of what is going on.  When you are finished, type &lt;F4&gt;
(<code>kmacro-end-or-call-macro</code>) to terminate the definition.  For
example,

<pre class="example">     &lt;F3&gt; M-f foo &lt;F4&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">defines a macro to move forward a word and then insert `<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>'. 
Note that &lt;F3&gt; and &lt;F4&gt; do not become part of the macro.

   <p>After defining the macro, you can call it with &lt;F4&gt;.  For the
above example, this has the same effect as typing <kbd>M-f foo</kbd> again. 
(Note the two roles of the &lt;F4&gt; command: it ends the macro if you
are in the process of defining one, or calls the last macro
otherwise.)  You can also supply &lt;F4&gt; with a numeric prefix
argument `<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>', which means to invoke the macro `<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>' times.  An
argument of zero repeats the macro indefinitely, until it gets an
error or you type <kbd>C-g</kbd> (or, on MS-DOS, <kbd>C-&lt;BREAK&gt;</kbd>).

   <p>The above example demonstrates a handy trick that you can employ
with keyboard macros: if you wish to repeat an operation at regularly
spaced places in the text, include a motion command as part of the
macro.  In this case, repeating the macro inserts the string
`<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>' after each successive word.

   <p>After terminating the definition of a keyboard macro, you can append
more keystrokes to its definition by typing <kbd>C-u &lt;F3&gt;</kbd>.  This
is equivalent to plain &lt;F3&gt; followed by retyping the whole
definition so far.  As a consequence, it re-executes the macro as
previously defined.  If you change the variable
<code>kmacro-execute-before-append</code> to <code>nil</code>, the existing macro
will not be re-executed before appending to it (the default is
<code>t</code>).  You can also add to the end of the definition of the last
keyboard macro without re-executing it by typing <kbd>C-u C-u
&lt;F3&gt;</kbd>.

   <p>When a command reads an argument with the minibuffer, your
minibuffer input becomes part of the macro along with the command.  So
when you replay the macro, the command gets the same argument as when
you entered the macro.  For example,

<pre class="example">     &lt;F3&gt; C-a C-k C-x b foo &lt;RET&gt; C-y C-x b &lt;RET&gt; &lt;F4&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">defines a macro that kills the current line, yanks it into the buffer
`<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>', then returns to the original buffer.

   <p>Most keyboard commands work as usual in a keyboard macro definition,
with some exceptions.  Typing <kbd>C-g</kbd> (<code>keyboard-quit</code>) quits
the keyboard macro definition.  Typing <kbd>C-M-c</kbd>
(<code>exit-recursive-edit</code>) can be unreliable: it works as you'd
expect if exiting a recursive edit that started within the macro, but
if it exits a recursive edit that started before you invoked the
keyboard macro, it also necessarily exits the keyboard macro too. 
Mouse events are also unreliable, even though you can use them in a
keyboard macro: when the macro replays the mouse event, it uses the
original mouse position of that event, the position that the mouse had
while you were defining the macro.  The effect of this may be hard to
predict.

repeats the last defined keyboard macro on each line that begins in
the region.  It does this line by line, by moving point to the
beginning of the line and then executing the macro.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-_0028-1090"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-_0029-1091"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-e-1092"></a><a name="index-kmacro_002dstart_002dmacro-1093"></a><a name="index-kmacro_002dend_002dmacro-1094"></a>  In addition to the &lt;F3&gt; and &lt;F4&gt; commands described above,
Emacs also supports an older set of key bindings for defining and
executing keyboard macros.  To begin a macro definition, type <kbd>C-x
(</kbd> (<code>kmacro-start-macro</code>); as with &lt;F3&gt;, a prefix argument
appends this definition to the last keyboard macro.  To end a macro
definition, type <kbd>C-x )</kbd> (<code>kmacro-end-macro</code>).  To execute
the most recent macro, type <kbd>C-x e</kbd>
(<code>kmacro-end-and-call-macro</code>).  If you enter <kbd>C-x e</kbd> while
defining a macro, the macro is terminated and executed immediately. 
Immediately after typing <kbd>C-x e</kbd>, you can type &lt;e&gt; repeatedly
to immediately repeat the macro one or more times.  You can also give
<kbd>C-x e</kbd> a repeat argument, just like &lt;F4&gt;.

   <p><kbd>C-x )</kbd> can be given a repeat count as an argument.  This means
to repeat the macro right after defining it.  The macro definition
itself counts as the first repetition, since it is executed as you
define it, so <kbd>C-u 4 C-x )</kbd> executes the macro immediately 3
additional times.

<h3 class="section">17.2 The Keyboard Macro Ring</h3>

<p>All defined keyboard macros are recorded in the <dfn>keyboard macro
ring</dfn>.  There is only one keyboard macro ring, shared by all buffers.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x C-k C-k</kbd><dd>Execute the keyboard macro at the head of the ring (<code>kmacro-end-or-call-macro-repeat</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x C-k C-n</kbd><dd>Rotate the keyboard macro ring to the next macro (defined earlier)

<br><dt><kbd>C-x C-k C-p</kbd><dd>Rotate the keyboard macro ring to the previous macro (defined later)
(<code>kmacro-cycle-ring-previous</code>). 
</dl>

   <p>All commands which operate on the keyboard macro ring use the
same <kbd>C-x C-k</kbd> prefix.  Most of these commands can be executed and
repeated immediately after each other without repeating the <kbd>C-x
C-k</kbd> prefix.  For example,

<pre class="example">     C-x C-k C-p C-p C-k C-k C-k C-n C-n C-k C-p C-k C-d
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will rotate the keyboard macro ring to the second-previous macro,
execute the resulting head macro three times, rotate back to the
original head macro, execute that once, rotate to the previous
macro, execute that, and finally delete it from the macro ring.

   <p><a name="index-kmacro_002dend_002dor_002dcall_002dmacro_002drepeat-1095"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dk-C_002dk-1096"></a>  The command <kbd>C-x C-k C-k</kbd> (<code>kmacro-end-or-call-macro-repeat</code>)
executes the keyboard macro at the head of the macro ring.  You can
repeat the macro immediately by typing another <kbd>C-k</kbd>, or you can
rotate the macro ring immediately by typing <kbd>C-n</kbd> or <kbd>C-p</kbd>.

   <p>When a keyboard macro is being defined, <kbd>C-x C-k C-k</kbd> behaves
like &lt;F4&gt; except that, immediately afterward, you can use most key
bindings of this section without the <kbd>C-x C-k</kbd> prefix.  For
instance, another <kbd>C-k</kbd> will re-execute the macro.

   <p><a name="index-kmacro_002dcycle_002dring_002dnext-1097"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dk-C_002dn-1098"></a><a name="index-kmacro_002dcycle_002dring_002dprevious-1099"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dk-C_002dp-1100"></a>  The commands <kbd>C-x C-k C-n</kbd> (<code>kmacro-cycle-ring-next</code>) and
<kbd>C-x C-k C-p</kbd> (<code>kmacro-cycle-ring-previous</code>) rotate the
macro ring, bringing the next or previous keyboard macro to the head
of the macro ring.  The definition of the new head macro is displayed
in the echo area.  You can continue to rotate the macro ring
immediately by repeating just <kbd>C-n</kbd> and <kbd>C-p</kbd> until the
desired macro is at the head of the ring.  To execute the new macro
ring head immediately, just type <kbd>C-k</kbd>.

   <p>Note that Emacs treats the head of the macro ring as the last
defined keyboard macro.  For instance, &lt;F4&gt; will execute that
macro, and <kbd>C-x C-k n</kbd> will give it a name.

   <p><a name="index-kmacro_002dring_002dmax-1101"></a>  The maximum number of macros stored in the keyboard macro ring is
determined by the customizable variable <code>kmacro-ring-max</code>.

<h3 class="section">17.3 The Keyboard Macro Counter</h3>

<p>Each keyboard macro has an associated counter, which is initialized
to 0 when you start defining the macro.  This counter allows you to
insert a number into the buffer that depends on the number of times
the macro has been called.  The counter is incremented each time its
value is inserted into the buffer.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>&lt;F3&gt;</kbd><dd>In a keyboard macro definition, insert the keyboard macro counter
value in the buffer (<code>kmacro-start-macro-or-insert-counter</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x C-k C-i</kbd><dd>Insert the keyboard macro counter value in the buffer
(<code>kmacro-insert-counter</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x C-k C-c</kbd><dd>Set the keyboard macro counter (<code>kmacro-set-counter</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x C-k C-a</kbd><dd>Add the prefix arg to the keyboard macro counter (<code>kmacro-add-counter</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x C-k C-f</kbd><dd>Specify the format for inserting the keyboard macro counter
(<code>kmacro-set-format</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-kmacro_002dinsert_002dcounter-1102"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dk-C_002di-1103"></a>  When you are defining a keyboard macro, the command &lt;F3&gt;
(<code>kmacro-start-macro-or-insert-counter</code>) inserts the current
value of the keyboard macro's counter into the buffer, and increments
the counter by 1.  (If you are not defining a macro, &lt;F3&gt; begins a
macro definition instead.  See <a href="#Basic-Keyboard-Macro">Basic Keyboard Macro</a>.)  You can use
a numeric prefix argument to specify a different increment.  If you
just specify a <kbd>C-u</kbd> prefix, that is the same as an increment of
zero: it inserts the current counter value without changing it.

   <p>As an example, let us show how the keyboard macro counter can be
used to build a numbered list.  Consider the following key sequence:

<pre class="example">     &lt;F3&gt; C-a &lt;F3&gt; . &lt;SPC&gt; &lt;F4&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">As part of this keyboard macro definition, the string `<samp><span class="samp">0. </span></samp>' was
inserted into the beginning of the current line.  If you now move
somewhere else in the buffer and type &lt;F4&gt; to invoke the macro,
the string `<samp><span class="samp">1. </span></samp>' is inserted at the beginning of that line. 
Subsequent invocations insert `<samp><span class="samp">2. </span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">3. </span></samp>', and so forth.

   <p>The command <kbd>C-x C-k C-i</kbd> (<code>kmacro-insert-counter</code>) does
the same thing as &lt;F3&gt;, but it can be used outside a keyboard
macro definition.  When no keyboard macro is being defined or
executed, it inserts and increments the counter of the macro at the
head of the keyboard macro ring.

   <p><a name="index-kmacro_002dset_002dcounter-1104"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dk-C_002dc-1105"></a>  The command <kbd>C-x C-k C-c</kbd> (<code>kmacro-set-counter</code>) sets the
current macro counter to the value of the numeric argument.  If you use
it inside the macro, it operates on each repetition of the macro.  If
you specify just <kbd>C-u</kbd> as the prefix, while executing the macro,
that resets the counter to the value it had at the beginning of the
current repetition of the macro (undoing any increments so far in this
repetition).

   <p><a name="index-kmacro_002dadd_002dcounter-1106"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dk-C_002da-1107"></a>  The command <kbd>C-x C-k C-a</kbd> (<code>kmacro-add-counter</code>) adds the
prefix argument to the current macro counter.  With just <kbd>C-u</kbd> as
argument, it resets the counter to the last value inserted by any
keyboard macro.  (Normally, when you use this, the last insertion
will be in the same macro and it will be the same counter.)

   <p><a name="index-kmacro_002dset_002dformat-1108"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dk-C_002df-1109"></a>  The command <kbd>C-x C-k C-f</kbd> (<code>kmacro-set-format</code>) prompts for
the format to use when inserting the macro counter.  The default
format is `<samp><span class="samp">%d</span></samp>', which means to insert the number in decimal
without any padding.  You can exit with empty minibuffer to reset the
format to this default.  You can specify any format string that the
<code>format</code> function accepts and that makes sense with a single
integer extra argument (see <a href="elisp.html#Formatting-Strings">Formatting Strings</a>).  Do not put the format string inside double
quotes when you insert it in the minibuffer.

   <p>If you use this command while no keyboard macro is being defined or
executed, the new format affects all subsequent macro definitions. 
Existing macros continue to use the format in effect when they were
defined.  If you set the format while defining a keyboard macro, this
affects the macro being defined from that point on, but it does not
affect subsequent macros.  Execution of the macro will, at each step,
use the format in effect at that step during its definition.  Changes
to the macro format during execution of a macro, like the
corresponding changes during its definition, have no effect on
subsequent macros.

   <p>The format set by <kbd>C-x C-k C-f</kbd> does not affect insertion of
numbers stored in registers.

   <p>If you use a register as a counter, incrementing it on each
repetition of the macro, that accomplishes the same thing as a
keyboard macro counter.  See <a href="#Number-Registers">Number Registers</a>.  For most purposes,
it is simpler to use a keyboard macro counter.

<h3 class="section">17.4 Executing Macros with Variations</h3>

<p>In a keyboard macro, you can create an effect similar to that of
<code>query-replace</code>, in that the macro asks you each time around
whether to make a change.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x q</kbd><dd>When this point is reached during macro execution, ask for confirmation
(<code>kbd-macro-query</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-q-1110"></a><a name="index-kbd_002dmacro_002dquery-1111"></a>  While defining the macro, type <kbd>C-x q</kbd> at the point where you
want the query to occur.  During macro definition, the <kbd>C-x q</kbd>
does nothing, but when you run the macro later, <kbd>C-x q</kbd> asks you
interactively whether to continue.

   <p>The valid responses when <kbd>C-x q</kbd> asks are:

     <dl>
<dt>&lt;SPC&gt; (or <kbd>y</kbd>)<dd>Continue executing the keyboard macro.

     <br><dt>&lt;DEL&gt; (or <kbd>n</kbd>)<dd>Skip the remainder of this repetition of the macro, and start right
away with the next repetition.

     <br><dt>&lt;RET&gt; (or <kbd>q</kbd>)<dd>Skip the remainder of this repetition and cancel further repetitions.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-r</kbd><dd>Enter a recursive editing level, in which you can perform editing
which is not part of the macro.  When you exit the recursive edit
using <kbd>C-M-c</kbd>, you are asked again how to continue with the
keyboard macro.  If you type a &lt;SPC&gt; at this time, the rest of the
macro definition is executed.  It is up to you to leave point and the
text in a state such that the rest of the macro will do what you want. 
</dl>

   <p><kbd>C-u C-x q</kbd>, which is <kbd>C-x q</kbd> with a numeric argument,
performs a completely different function.  It enters a recursive edit
reading input from the keyboard, both when you type it during the
definition of the macro, and when it is executed from the macro.  During
definition, the editing you do inside the recursive edit does not become
part of the macro.  During macro execution, the recursive edit gives you
a chance to do some particularized editing on each repetition.

a name using <kbd>C-x C-k n</kbd> (<code>kmacro-name-last-macro</code>). 
This reads a name as an argument using the minibuffer and defines that
name to execute the last keyboard macro, in its current form.  (If you
later add to the definition of this macro, that does not alter the
name's definition as a macro.)  The macro name is a Lisp symbol, and
defining it in this way makes it a valid command name for calling with
<kbd>M-x</kbd> or for binding a key to with <code>global-set-key</code>
(see <a href="#Keymaps">Keymaps</a>).  If you specify a name that has a prior definition
other than a keyboard macro, an error message is shown and nothing is
changed.

   <p><a name="index-binding-keyboard-macros-1115"></a><a name="index-kmacro_002dbind_002dto_002dkey-1116"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dk-b-1117"></a>  You can also bind the last keyboard macro (in its current form) to a
key, using <kbd>C-x C-k b</kbd> (<code>kmacro-bind-to-key</code>) followed by the
key sequence you want to bind.  You can bind to any key sequence in
the global keymap, but since most key sequences already have other
bindings, you should select the key sequence carefully.  If you try to
bind to a key sequence with an existing binding (in any keymap), this
command asks you for confirmation before replacing the existing binding.

   <p>To avoid problems caused by overriding existing bindings, the key
sequences <kbd>C-x C-k 0</kbd> through <kbd>C-x C-k 9</kbd> and <kbd>C-x C-k A</kbd>
through <kbd>C-x C-k Z</kbd> are reserved for your own keyboard macro
bindings.  In fact, to bind to one of these key sequences, you only
need to type the digit or letter rather than the whole key sequences. 
For example,

<pre class="example">     C-x C-k b 4
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will bind the last keyboard macro to the key sequence <kbd>C-x C-k 4</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-insert_002dkbd_002dmacro-1118"></a>  Once a macro has a command name, you can save its definition in a file. 
Then it can be used in another editing session.  First, visit the file
you want to save the definition in.  Then use this command:

<pre class="example">     M-x insert-kbd-macro &lt;RET&gt; <var>macroname</var> &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This inserts some Lisp code that, when executed later, will define the
same macro with the same definition it has now.  (You need not
understand Lisp code to do this, because <code>insert-kbd-macro</code> writes
the Lisp code for you.)  Then save the file.  You can load the file
later with <code>load-file</code> (see <a href="#Lisp-Libraries">Lisp Libraries</a>).  If the file you
save in is your init file <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> (see <a href="#Init-File">Init File</a>) then the
macro will be defined each time you run Emacs.

   <p>If you give <code>insert-kbd-macro</code> a numeric argument, it makes
additional Lisp code to record the keys (if any) that you have bound
to <var>macroname</var>, so that the macro will be reassigned the same keys
when you load the file.

<h3 class="section">17.7 Stepwise Editing a Keyboard Macro</h3>

<p><a name="index-kmacro_002dstep_002dedit_002dmacro-1126"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dk-SPC-1127"></a>  You can interactively replay and edit the last keyboard
macro, one command at a time, by typing <kbd>C-x C-k &lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>
(<code>kmacro-step-edit-macro</code>).  Unless you quit the macro using
<kbd>q</kbd> or <kbd>C-g</kbd>, the edited macro replaces the last macro on the
macro ring.

   <p>This macro editing feature shows the last macro in the minibuffer
together with the first (or next) command to be executed, and prompts
you for an action.  You can enter <kbd>?</kbd> to get a summary of your
options.  These actions are available:

     <ul>
<li>&lt;SPC&gt; and <kbd>y</kbd> execute the current command, and advance to the
next command in the keyboard macro. 
<li><kbd>n</kbd>, <kbd>d</kbd>, and &lt;DEL&gt; skip and delete the current command. 
<li><kbd>f</kbd> skips the current command in this execution of the keyboard
macro, but doesn't delete it from the macro. 
<li>&lt;TAB&gt; executes the current command, as well as all similar
commands immediately following the current command; for example, &lt;TAB&gt;
may be used to insert a sequence of characters (corresponding to a
sequence of <code>self-insert-command</code> commands). 
<li><kbd>c</kbd> continues execution (without further editing) until the end of
the keyboard macro.  If execution terminates normally, the edited
macro replaces the original keyboard macro. 
<li><kbd>C-k</kbd> skips and deletes the rest of the keyboard macro,
terminates step-editing, and replaces the original keyboard macro
with the edited macro. 
<li><kbd>q</kbd> and <kbd>C-g</kbd> cancels the step-editing of the keyboard macro;
discarding any changes made to the keyboard macro. 
<li><kbd>i </kbd><var>key</var><kbd>... C-j</kbd> reads and executes a series of key sequences (not
including the final <kbd>C-j</kbd>), and inserts them before the current
command in the keyboard macro, without advancing over the current
command. 
<li><kbd>I </kbd><var>key</var><kbd>...</kbd> reads one key sequence, executes it, and inserts it
before the current command in the keyboard macro, without advancing
over the current command. 
<li><kbd>r </kbd><var>key</var><kbd>... C-j</kbd> reads and executes a series of key sequences (not
including the final <kbd>C-j</kbd>), and replaces the current command in
the keyboard macro with them, advancing over the inserted key
sequences. 
<li><kbd>R </kbd><var>key</var><kbd>...</kbd> reads one key sequence, executes it, and replaces the
current command in the keyboard macro with that key sequence,
advancing over the inserted key sequence. 
<li><kbd>a </kbd><var>key</var><kbd>... C-j</kbd> executes the current command, then reads and
executes a series of key sequences (not including the final
<kbd>C-j</kbd>), and inserts them after the current command in the keyboard
macro; it then advances over the current command and the inserted key
sequences. 
<li><kbd>A </kbd><var>key</var><kbd>... C-j</kbd> executes the rest of the commands in the keyboard
macro, then reads and executes a series of key sequences (not
including the final <kbd>C-j</kbd>), and appends them at the end of the
keyboard macro; it then terminates the step-editing and replaces the
original keyboard macro with the edited macro.

<h2 class="chapter">18 File Handling</h2>

<p><a name="index-files-1128"></a>
  The operating system stores data permanently in named <dfn>files</dfn>, so
most of the text you edit with Emacs comes from a file and is ultimately
stored in a file.

   <p>To edit a file, you must tell Emacs to read the file and prepare a
buffer containing a copy of the file's text.  This is called
<dfn>visiting</dfn> the file.  Editing commands apply directly to text in the
buffer; that is, to the copy inside Emacs.  Your changes appear in the
file itself only when you <dfn>save</dfn> the buffer back into the file.

   <p>In addition to visiting and saving files, Emacs can delete, copy,
rename, and append to files, keep multiple versions of them, and operate
on file directories.

<h3 class="section">18.1 File Names</h3>

<p><a name="index-file-names-1129"></a>
<a name="index-default-file-name-1130"></a>  Many Emacs commands that operate on a file require you to specify
the file name, using the minibuffer (see <a href="#Minibuffer-File">Minibuffer File</a>).

   <p>While in the minibuffer, you can use the usual completion and
history commands (see <a href="#Minibuffer">Minibuffer</a>).  Note that file name completion
ignores file names whose extensions appear in the variable
<code>completion-ignored-extensions</code> (see <a href="#Completion-Options">Completion Options</a>). 
Note also that most commands use permissive completion with
confirmation for reading file names: you are allowed to submit a
nonexistent file name, but if you type &lt;RET&gt; immediately after
completing up to a nonexistent file name, Emacs prints
`<samp><span class="samp">[Confirm]</span></samp>' and you must type a second &lt;RET&gt; to confirm. 
See <a href="#Completion-Exit">Completion Exit</a>, for details.

   <p><a name="index-default-directory-1131"></a><a name="index-default_002ddirectory-1132"></a><a name="index-insert_002ddefault_002ddirectory-1133"></a>  Each buffer has a <dfn>default directory</dfn>, stored in the
buffer-local variable <code>default-directory</code>.  Whenever Emacs reads
a file name using the minibuffer, it usually inserts the default
directory into the minibuffer as the initial contents.  You can
inhibit this insertion by changing the variable
<code>insert-default-directory</code> to <code>nil</code> (see <a href="#Minibuffer-File">Minibuffer File</a>).  Regardless, Emacs always assumes that any relative file name
is relative to the default directory, e.g., entering a file name
without a directory specifies a file in the default directory.

   <p><a name="index-cd-1134"></a><a name="index-pwd-1135"></a>  When you visit a file, Emacs sets <code>default-directory</code> in the
visiting buffer to the directory of its file.  When you create a new
buffer that is not visiting a file, via a command like <kbd>C-x b</kbd>,
its default directory is usually copied from the buffer that was
current at the time (see <a href="#Select-Buffer">Select Buffer</a>).  You can use the command
<kbd>M-x pwd</kbd> to see the value of <code>default-directory</code> in the
current buffer.  The command <kbd>M-x cd</kbd> prompts for a directory
name, and sets the buffer's <code>default-directory</code> to that directory
(doing this does not change the buffer's file name, if any).

   <p>As an example, when you visit the file <samp><span class="file">/u/rms/gnu/gnu.tasks</span></samp>,
the default directory is set to <samp><span class="file">/u/rms/gnu/</span></samp>.  If you invoke a
command that reads a file name, entering just `<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>' in the
minibuffer, with a directory omitted, specifies the file
<samp><span class="file">/u/rms/gnu/foo</span></samp>; entering `<samp><span class="samp">../.login</span></samp>' specifies
<samp><span class="file">/u/rms/.login</span></samp>; and entering `<samp><span class="samp">new/foo</span></samp>' specifies
<samp><span class="file">/u/rms/gnu/new/foo</span></samp>.

   <p>When typing a file name into the minibuffer, you can make use of a
couple of shortcuts: a double slash ignores everything before the
second slash in the pair, and `<samp><span class="samp">~/</span></samp>' is your home directory. 
See <a href="#Minibuffer-File">Minibuffer File</a>.

   <p><a name="index-environment-variables-in-file-names-1136"></a><a name="index-expansion-of-environment-variables-1137"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_0024_007d-in-file-names-1138"></a>  <a name="File-Names-with-_0024"></a>The character `<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>' is used to
substitute an environment variable into a file name.  The name of the
environment variable consists of all the alphanumeric characters after
the `<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>'; alternatively, it can be enclosed in braces after the
`<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>'.  For example, if you have used the shell command
<samp><span class="command">export FOO=rms/hacks</span></samp> to set up an environment variable named
<samp><span class="env">FOO</span></samp>, then both <samp><span class="file">/u/$FOO/test.c</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">/u/${FOO}/test.c</span></samp> are abbreviations for
<samp><span class="file">/u/rms/hacks/test.c</span></samp>.  If the environment variable is not
defined, no substitution occurs, so that the character `<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>' stands
for itself.  Note that environment variables affect Emacs only if they
are applied before Emacs is started.

   <p>To access a file with `<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>' in its name, if the `<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>' causes
expansion, type `<samp><span class="samp">$$</span></samp>'.  This pair is converted to a single
`<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>' at the same time that variable substitution is performed for
a single `<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>'.  Alternatively, quote the whole file name with
`<samp><span class="samp">/:</span></samp>' (see <a href="#Quoted-File-Names">Quoted File Names</a>).  File names which begin with a
literal `<samp><span class="samp">~</span></samp>' should also be quoted with `<samp><span class="samp">/:</span></samp>'.

   <p>You can include non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters in file names.

   <p><a name="index-files_002c-visiting-and-saving-1141"></a><a name="index-saving-files-1142"></a>  <dfn>Visiting</dfn> a file means reading its contents into an Emacs
buffer so you can edit them.  Emacs makes a new buffer for each file
that you visit.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002df-1143"></a><a name="index-find_002dfile-1144"></a>  To visit a file, type <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> (<code>find-file</code>) and use the
minibuffer to enter the name of the desired file.  While in the
minibuffer, you can abort the command by typing <kbd>C-g</kbd>.  See <a href="#File-Names">File Names</a>, for details about entering file names into minibuffers.

   <p>If the specified file exists but the system does not allow you to
read it, an error message is displayed in the echo area.  Otherwise,
you can tell that <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> has completed successfully by the
appearance of new text on the screen, and by the buffer name shown in
the mode line (see <a href="#Mode-Line">Mode Line</a>).  Emacs normally constructs the
buffer name from the file name, omitting the directory name.  For
example, a file named <samp><span class="file">/usr/rms/emacs.tex</span></samp> is visited in a buffer
named `<samp><span class="samp">emacs.tex</span></samp>'.  If there is already a buffer with that name,
Emacs constructs a unique name; the normal method is to add a suffix
based on the directory name (e.g., `<samp><span class="samp">&lt;rms&gt;</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">&lt;tmp&gt;</span></samp>',
and so on), but you can select other methods.  See <a href="#Uniquify">Uniquify</a>.

   <p><a name="index-creating-files-1145"></a>  To create a new file, just visit it using the same command, <kbd>C-x
C-f</kbd>.  Emacs displays `<samp><span class="samp">(New file)</span></samp>' in the echo area, but in other
respects behaves as if you had visited an existing empty file.

   <p><a name="index-modified-_0028buffer_0029-1146"></a>  After visiting a file, the changes you make with editing commands are
made in the Emacs buffer.  They do not take effect in the visited
file, until you <dfn>save</dfn> the buffer (see <a href="#Saving">Saving</a>).  If a buffer
contains changes that have not been saved, we say the buffer is
<dfn>modified</dfn>.  This implies that some changes will be lost if the
buffer is not saved.  The mode line displays two stars near the left
margin to indicate that the buffer is modified.

   <p>If you visit a file that is already in Emacs, <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> switches
to the existing buffer instead of making another copy.  Before doing
so, it checks whether the file has changed since you last visited or
saved it.  If the file has changed, Emacs offers to reread it.

   <p><a name="index-large_002dfile_002dwarning_002dthreshold-1147"></a><a name="index-file_002c-warning-when-size-is-large-1148"></a><a name="index-size-of-file_002c-warning-when-visiting-1149"></a><a name="index-maximum-buffer-size-exceeded_002c-error-message-1150"></a>  If you try to visit a file larger than
<code>large-file-warning-threshold</code> (the default is 10000000, which is
about 10 megabytes), Emacs asks you for confirmation first.  You can
answer <kbd>y</kbd> to proceed with visiting the file.  Note, however, that
Emacs cannot visit files that are larger than the maximum Emacs buffer
size, which is limited by the amount of memory Emacs can allocate and
by the integers that Emacs can represent (see <a href="#Buffers">Buffers</a>).  If you
try, Emacs displays an error message saying that the maximum buffer
size has been exceeded.

   <p><a name="index-wildcard-characters-in-file-names-1151"></a><a name="index-find_002dfile_002dwildcards-1152"></a>  If the file name you specify contains shell-style wildcard
characters, Emacs visits all the files that match it.  (On
case-insensitive filesystems, Emacs matches the wildcards disregarding
the letter case.)  Wildcards include `<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>', and
`<samp><span class="samp">[...]</span></samp>' sequences.  To enter the wild card `<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>' in a file
name in the minibuffer, you need to type <kbd>C-q ?</kbd>.  See <a href="#Quoted-File-Names">Quoted File Names</a>, for information on how to visit a file whose name
actually contains wildcard characters.  You can disable the wildcard
feature by customizing <code>find-file-wildcards</code>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dv-1153"></a><a name="index-find_002dalternate_002dfile-1154"></a>  If you visit the wrong file unintentionally by typing its name
incorrectly, type <kbd>C-x C-v</kbd> (<code>find-alternate-file</code>) to visit
the file you really wanted.  <kbd>C-x C-v</kbd> is similar to <kbd>C-x
C-f</kbd>, but it kills the current buffer (after first offering to save it
if it is modified).  When <kbd>C-x C-v</kbd> reads the file name to visit,
it inserts the entire default file name in the buffer, with point just
after the directory part; this is convenient if you made a slight
error in typing the name.

   <p><a name="index-find_002dfile_002drun_002ddired-1155"></a>  If you visit a file that is actually a directory, Emacs invokes
Dired, the Emacs directory browser.  See <a href="#Dired">Dired</a>.  You can disable
this behavior by setting the variable <code>find-file-run-dired</code> to
<code>nil</code>; in that case, it is an error to try to visit a directory.

   <p>Files which are actually collections of other files, or <dfn>file
archives</dfn>, are visited in special modes which invoke a Dired-like
environment to allow operations on archive members.  See <a href="#File-Archives">File Archives</a>, for more about these features.

   <p>If you visit a file that the operating system won't let you modify,
or that is marked read-only, Emacs makes the buffer read-only too, so
that you won't go ahead and make changes that you'll have trouble
saving afterward.  You can make the buffer writable with <kbd>C-x C-q</kbd>
(<code>read-only-mode</code>).  See <a href="#Misc-Buffer">Misc Buffer</a>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dr-1156"></a><a name="index-find_002dfile_002dread_002donly-1157"></a>  If you want to visit a file as read-only in order to protect
yourself from entering changes accidentally, visit it with the command
<kbd>C-x C-r</kbd> (<code>find-file-read-only</code>) instead of <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-4-f-1158"></a><a name="index-find_002dfile_002dother_002dwindow-1159"></a>  <kbd>C-x 4 f</kbd> (<code>find-file-other-window</code>) is like <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>
except that the buffer containing the specified file is selected in another
window.  The window that was selected before <kbd>C-x 4 f</kbd> continues to
show the same buffer it was already showing.  If this command is used when
only one window is being displayed, that window is split in two, with one
window showing the same buffer as before, and the other one showing the
newly requested file.  See <a href="#Windows">Windows</a>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-5-f-1160"></a><a name="index-find_002dfile_002dother_002dframe-1161"></a>  <kbd>C-x 5 f</kbd> (<code>find-file-other-frame</code>) is similar, but opens a
new frame, or selects any existing frame showing the specified file. 
See <a href="#Frames">Frames</a>.

   <p><a name="index-file-selection-dialog-1162"></a>  On graphical displays, there are two additional methods for visiting
files.  Firstly, when Emacs is built with a suitable GUI toolkit,
commands invoked with the mouse (by clicking on the menu bar or tool
bar) use the toolkit's standard file selection dialog instead of
prompting for the file name in the minibuffer.  On GNU/Linux and Unix
platforms, Emacs does this when built with GTK, LessTif, and Motif
toolkits; on MS-Windows and Mac, the GUI version does that by default. 
For information on how to customize this, see <a href="#Dialog-Boxes">Dialog Boxes</a>.

   <p>Secondly, Emacs supports drag and drop: dropping a file into an
ordinary Emacs window visits the file using that window.  As an
exception, dropping a file into a window displaying a Dired buffer
moves or copies the file into the displayed directory.  For details,
see <a href="#Drag-and-Drop">Drag and Drop</a>, and <a href="#Misc-Dired-Features">Misc Dired Features</a>.

   <p>On text-mode terminals and on graphical displays when Emacs was
built without a GUI toolkit, you can visit files via the menu-bar
`<samp><span class="samp">File</span></samp>' menu, which has a `<samp><span class="samp">Visit New File</span></samp>' item.

   <p>Each time you visit a file, Emacs automatically scans its contents
to detect what character encoding and end-of-line convention it uses,
and converts these to Emacs's internal encoding and end-of-line
convention within the buffer.  When you save the buffer, Emacs
performs the inverse conversion, writing the file to disk with its
original encoding and end-of-line convention.  See <a href="#Coding-Systems">Coding Systems</a>.

   <p><a name="index-find_002dfile_002dliterally-1163"></a>  If you wish to edit a file as a sequence of <acronym>ASCII</acronym>
characters with no special encoding or conversion, use the <kbd>M-x
find-file-literally</kbd> command.  This visits a file, like <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>,
but does not do format conversion (see <a href="elisp.html#Format-Conversion">Format Conversion</a>), character code
conversion (see <a href="#Coding-Systems">Coding Systems</a>), or automatic uncompression
(see <a href="#Compressed-Files">Compressed Files</a>), and does not add a final newline because
of <code>require-final-newline</code> (see <a href="#Customize-Save">Customize Save</a>).  If you have
already visited the same file in the usual (non-literal) manner, this
command asks you whether to visit it literally instead.

   <p><a name="index-find_002dfile_002dhook-1164"></a><a name="index-find_002dfile_002dnot_002dfound_002dfunctions-1165"></a>  Two special hook variables allow extensions to modify the operation
of visiting files.  Visiting a file that does not exist runs the
functions in <code>find-file-not-found-functions</code>; this variable holds
a list of functions, which are called one by one (with no arguments)
until one of them returns non-<code>nil</code>.  This is not a normal hook,
and the name ends in `<samp><span class="samp">-functions</span></samp>' rather than `<samp><span class="samp">-hook</span></samp>' to
indicate that fact.

   <p>Successful visiting of any file, whether existing or not, calls the
functions in <code>find-file-hook</code>, with no arguments.  This variable
is a normal hook.  In the case of a nonexistent file, the
<code>find-file-not-found-functions</code> are run first.  See <a href="#Hooks">Hooks</a>.

   <p>There are several ways to specify automatically the major mode for
editing the file (see <a href="#Choosing-Modes">Choosing Modes</a>), and to specify local
variables defined for that file (see <a href="#File-Variables">File Variables</a>).

<h4 class="subsection">18.3.1 Commands for Saving Files</h4>

<p>These are the commands that relate to saving and writing files.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x C-s</kbd><dd>Save the current buffer to its file (<code>save-buffer</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x s</kbd><dd>Save any or all buffers to their files (<code>save-some-buffers</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-~</kbd><dd>Forget that the current buffer has been changed (<code>not-modified</code>). 
With prefix argument (<kbd>C-u</kbd>), mark the current buffer as changed. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x C-w</kbd><dd>Save the current buffer with a specified file name (<code>write-file</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x set-visited-file-name</kbd><dd>Change the file name under which the current buffer will be saved. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002ds-1166"></a><a name="index-save_002dbuffer-1167"></a>  When you wish to save the file and make your changes permanent, type
<kbd>C-x C-s</kbd> (<code>save-buffer</code>).  After saving is finished, <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd>
displays a message like this:

<pre class="example">     Wrote /u/rms/gnu/gnu.tasks
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If the current buffer is not modified (no changes have been made in it
since the buffer was created or last saved), saving is not really
done, because it would have no effect.  Instead, <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd>
displays a message like this in the echo area:

<pre class="example">     (No changes need to be saved)
</pre>
   <p>With a prefix argument, <kbd>C-u C-x C-s</kbd>, Emacs also marks the buffer
to be backed up when the next save is done.  See <a href="#Backup">Backup</a>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-s-1168"></a><a name="index-save_002dsome_002dbuffers-1169"></a>  The command <kbd>C-x s</kbd> (<code>save-some-buffers</code>) offers to save any
or all modified buffers.  It asks you what to do with each buffer.  The
possible responses are analogous to those of <code>query-replace</code>:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>y</kbd><dd>Save this buffer and ask about the rest of the buffers. 
<br><dt><kbd>n</kbd><dd>Don't save this buffer, but ask about the rest of the buffers. 
<br><dt><kbd>!</kbd><dd>Save this buffer and all the rest with no more questions. 
<!-- following generates acceptable underfull hbox -->
<br><dt><kbd>&lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Terminate <code>save-some-buffers</code> without any more saving. 
<br><dt><kbd>.</kbd><dd>Save this buffer, then exit <code>save-some-buffers</code> without even asking
about other buffers. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-r</kbd><dd>View the buffer that you are currently being asked about.  When you exit
View mode, you get back to <code>save-some-buffers</code>, which asks the
question again. 
<br><dt><kbd>d</kbd><dd>Diff the buffer against its corresponding file, so you can see what
changes you would be saving.  This calls the command
<code>diff-buffer-with-file</code> (see <a href="#Comparing-Files">Comparing Files</a>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-h</kbd><dd>Display a help message about these options. 
</dl>

   <p><kbd>C-x C-c</kbd>, the key sequence to exit Emacs, invokes
<code>save-some-buffers</code> and therefore asks the same questions.

   <p><a name="index-M_002d_007e-1170"></a><a name="index-not_002dmodified-1171"></a>  If you have changed a buffer but do not wish to save the changes,
you should take some action to prevent it.  Otherwise, each time you
use <kbd>C-x s</kbd> or <kbd>C-x C-c</kbd>, you are liable to save this buffer
by mistake.  One thing you can do is type <kbd>M-~</kbd>
(<code>not-modified</code>), which clears out the indication that the buffer
is modified.  If you do this, none of the save commands will believe
that the buffer needs to be saved.  (`<samp><span class="samp">~</span></samp>' is often used as a
mathematical symbol for &ldquo;not&rdquo;; thus <kbd>M-~</kbd> is &ldquo;not&rdquo;, metafied.) 
Alternatively, you can cancel all the changes made since the file was
visited or saved, by reading the text from the file again.  This is
called <dfn>reverting</dfn>.  See <a href="#Reverting">Reverting</a>.  (You could also undo all
the changes by repeating the undo command <kbd>C-x u</kbd> until you have
undone all the changes; but reverting is easier.)

   <p><a name="index-set_002dvisited_002dfile_002dname-1172"></a>  <kbd>M-x set-visited-file-name</kbd> alters the name of the file that the
current buffer is visiting.  It reads the new file name using the
minibuffer.  Then it marks the buffer as visiting that file name, and
changes the buffer name correspondingly.  <code>set-visited-file-name</code>
does not save the buffer in the newly visited file; it just alters the
records inside Emacs in case you do save later.  It also marks the
buffer as modified so that <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd> in that buffer
<em>will</em> save.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dw-1173"></a><a name="index-write_002dfile-1174"></a>  If you wish to mark the buffer as visiting a different file and save
it right away, use <kbd>C-x C-w</kbd> (<code>write-file</code>).  This is
equivalent to <code>set-visited-file-name</code> followed by <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd>,
except that <kbd>C-x C-w</kbd> asks for confirmation if the file exists. 
<kbd>C-x C-s</kbd> used on a buffer that is not visiting a file has the
same effect as <kbd>C-x C-w</kbd>; that is, it reads a file name, marks the
buffer as visiting that file, and saves it there.  The default file
name in a buffer that is not visiting a file is made by combining the
buffer name with the buffer's default directory (see <a href="#File-Names">File Names</a>).

   <p>If the new file name implies a major mode, then <kbd>C-x C-w</kbd> switches
to that major mode, in most cases.  The command
<code>set-visited-file-name</code> also does this.  See <a href="#Choosing-Modes">Choosing Modes</a>.

   <p>If Emacs is about to save a file and sees that the date of the latest
version on disk does not match what Emacs last read or wrote, Emacs
notifies you of this fact, because it probably indicates a problem caused
by simultaneous editing and requires your immediate attention.

<h4 class="subsection">18.3.2 Backup Files</h4>

<p><a name="index-backup-file-1175"></a><a name="index-make_002dbackup_002dfiles-1176"></a><a name="index-vc_002dmake_002dbackup_002dfiles-1177"></a>
  On most operating systems, rewriting a file automatically destroys all
record of what the file used to contain.  Thus, saving a file from Emacs
throws away the old contents of the file&mdash;or it would, except that
Emacs carefully copies the old contents to another file, called the
<dfn>backup</dfn> file, before actually saving.

   <p>Emacs makes a backup for a file only the first time the file is
saved from a buffer.  No matter how many times you subsequently save
the file, its backup remains unchanged.  However, if you kill the
buffer and then visit the file again, a new backup file will be made.

   <p>For most files, the variable <code>make-backup-files</code> determines
whether to make backup files.  On most operating systems, its default
value is <code>t</code>, so that Emacs does write backup files.

   <p>For files managed by a version control system (see <a href="#Version-Control">Version Control</a>), the variable <code>vc-make-backup-files</code> determines whether
to make backup files.  By default it is <code>nil</code>, since backup files
are redundant when you store all the previous versions in a version
control system. 
See <a href="#General-VC-Options">General VC Options</a>.

   <p>At your option, Emacs can keep either a single backup for each file,
or make a series of numbered backup files for each file that you edit. 
See <a href="#Backup-Names">Backup Names</a>.

   <p><a name="index-backup_002denable_002dpredicate-1178"></a><a name="index-temporary_002dfile_002ddirectory-1179"></a><a name="index-small_002dtemporary_002dfile_002ddirectory-1180"></a>  The default value of the <code>backup-enable-predicate</code> variable
prevents backup files being written for files in the directories used
for temporary files, specified by <code>temporary-file-directory</code> or
<code>small-temporary-file-directory</code>.

   <p>You can explicitly tell Emacs to make another backup file from a
buffer, even though that buffer has been saved before.  If you save
the buffer with <kbd>C-u C-x C-s</kbd>, the version thus saved will be made
into a backup file if you save the buffer again.  <kbd>C-u C-u C-x
C-s</kbd> saves the buffer, but first makes the previous file contents into
a new backup file.  <kbd>C-u C-u C-u C-x C-s</kbd> does both things: it
makes a backup from the previous contents, and arranges to make
another from the newly saved contents if you save again.

   <p><a name="index-backup_002ddirectory_002dalist-1181"></a>  You can customize the variable <code>backup-directory-alist</code> to
specify that files matching certain patterns should be backed up in
specific directories.  A typical use is to add an element <code>("." 
. </code><var>dir</var><code>)</code> to make all backups in the directory with absolute name
<var>dir</var>.  Emacs modifies the backup file names to avoid clashes
between files with the same names originating in different
directories.  Alternatively, adding, <code>("." . ".~")</code> would make
backups in the invisible subdirectory <samp><span class="file">.~</span></samp> of the original file's
directory.  Emacs creates the directory, if necessary, to make the
backup.

appending `<samp><span class="samp">~</span></samp>' to the file name being edited; thus, the backup
file for <samp><span class="file">eval.c</span></samp> would be <samp><span class="file">eval.c~</span></samp>.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007b_007e_002f_002eemacs_002ed_002f_0025backup_0025_007e_007d-1186"></a>  If access control stops Emacs from writing backup files under the
usual names, it writes the backup file as <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs.d/%backup%~</span></samp>. 
Only one such file can exist, so only the most recently made such
backup is available.

   <p>Emacs can also make <dfn>numbered backup files</dfn>.  Numbered backup
file names contain `<samp><span class="samp">.~</span></samp>', the number, and another `<samp><span class="samp">~</span></samp>' after
the original file name.  Thus, the backup files of <samp><span class="file">eval.c</span></samp> would
be called <samp><span class="file">eval.c.~1~</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">eval.c.~2~</span></samp>, and so on, all the way
through names like <samp><span class="file">eval.c.~259~</span></samp> and beyond.

   <p><a name="index-version_002dcontrol-1187"></a>  The variable <code>version-control</code> determines whether to make
single backup files or multiple numbered backup files.  Its possible
values are:

     <dl>
<dt><code>nil</code><dd>Make numbered backups for files that have numbered backups already. 
Otherwise, make single backups.  This is the default. 
<br><dt><code>t</code><dd>Make numbered backups. 
<br><dt><code>never</code><dd>Never make numbered backups; always make single backups. 
</dl>

<p class="noindent">The usual way to set this variable is globally, through your init file
or the customization buffer.  However, you can set
<code>version-control</code> locally in an individual buffer to control the
making of backups for that buffer's file (see <a href="#Locals">Locals</a>).  You can
have Emacs set <code>version-control</code> locally whenever you visit a
given file (see <a href="#File-Variables">File Variables</a>).  Some modes, such as Rmail mode,
set this variable.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040env_007bVERSION_005fCONTROL_007d-environment-variable-1188"></a>  If you set the environment variable <samp><span class="env">VERSION_CONTROL</span></samp>, to tell
various GNU utilities what to do with backup files, Emacs also obeys the
environment variable by setting the Lisp variable <code>version-control</code>
accordingly at startup.  If the environment variable's value is `<samp><span class="samp">t</span></samp>'
or `<samp><span class="samp">numbered</span></samp>', then <code>version-control</code> becomes <code>t</code>; if the
value is `<samp><span class="samp">nil</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">existing</span></samp>', then <code>version-control</code>
becomes <code>nil</code>; if it is `<samp><span class="samp">never</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">simple</span></samp>', then
<code>version-control</code> becomes <code>never</code>.

   <p><a name="index-make_002dbackup_002dfile_002dname_002dfunction-1189"></a>  If you set the variable <code>make-backup-file-name-function</code> to
a suitable Lisp function, you can override the usual way Emacs
constructs backup file names.

<h5 class="subsubsection">18.3.2.2 Automatic Deletion of Backups</h5>

<p>To prevent excessive consumption of disk space, Emacs can delete numbered
backup versions automatically.  Generally Emacs keeps the first few backups
and the latest few backups, deleting any in between.  This happens every
time a new backup is made.

   <p><a name="index-kept_002dold_002dversions-1190"></a><a name="index-kept_002dnew_002dversions-1191"></a>  The two variables <code>kept-old-versions</code> and
<code>kept-new-versions</code> control this deletion.  Their values are,
respectively, the number of oldest (lowest-numbered) backups to keep
and the number of newest (highest-numbered) ones to keep, each time a
new backup is made.  The backups in the middle (excluding those oldest
and newest) are the excess middle versions&mdash;those backups are
deleted.  These variables' values are used when it is time to delete
excess versions, just after a new backup version is made; the newly
made backup is included in the count in <code>kept-new-versions</code>.  By
default, both variables are 2.

   <p><a name="index-delete_002dold_002dversions-1192"></a>  If <code>delete-old-versions</code> is <code>t</code>, Emacs deletes the excess
backup files silently.  If it is <code>nil</code>, the default, Emacs asks
you whether it should delete the excess backup versions.  If it has
any other value, then Emacs never automatically deletes backups.

   <p>Dired's <kbd>.</kbd> (Period) command can also be used to delete old versions.

<h5 class="subsubsection">18.3.2.3 Copying vs. Renaming</h5>

<p>Backup files can be made by copying the old file or by renaming it. 
This makes a difference when the old file has multiple names (hard
links).  If the old file is renamed into the backup file, then the
alternate names become names for the backup file.  If the old file is
copied instead, then the alternate names remain names for the file
that you are editing, and the contents accessed by those names will be
the new contents.

   <p>The method of making a backup file may also affect the file's owner
and group.  If copying is used, these do not change.  If renaming is used,
you become the file's owner, and the file's group becomes the default
(different operating systems have different defaults for the group).

   <p><a name="index-backup_002dby_002dcopying-1193"></a><a name="index-backup_002dby_002dcopying_002dwhen_002dlinked-1194"></a><a name="index-backup_002dby_002dcopying_002dwhen_002dmismatch-1195"></a><a name="index-backup_002dby_002dcopying_002dwhen_002dprivileged_002dmismatch-1196"></a><a name="index-file-ownership_002c-and-backup-1197"></a><a name="index-backup_002c-and-user_002did-1198"></a>  The choice of renaming or copying is made as follows:

     <ul>
<li>If the variable <code>backup-by-copying</code> is non-<code>nil</code> (the
default is <code>nil</code>), use copying.

     <li>Otherwise, if the variable <code>backup-by-copying-when-linked</code> is
non-<code>nil</code> (the default is <code>nil</code>), and the file has multiple
names, use copying.

     <li>Otherwise, if the variable <code>backup-by-copying-when-mismatch</code> is
non-<code>nil</code> (the default is <code>t</code>), and renaming would change
the file's owner or group, use copying.

     <p>If you change <code>backup-by-copying-when-mismatch</code> to <code>nil</code>,
Emacs checks the numeric user-id of the file's owner.  If this is
higher than <code>backup-by-copying-when-privileged-mismatch</code>, then it
behaves as though <code>backup-by-copying-when-mismatch</code> is
non-<code>nil</code> anyway.

     <li>Otherwise, renaming is the default choice. 
</ul>

   <p>When a file is managed with a version control system (see <a href="#Version-Control">Version Control</a>), Emacs does not normally make backups in the usual way for
that file.  But check-in and check-out are similar in some ways to
making backups.  One unfortunate similarity is that these operations
typically break hard links, disconnecting the file name you visited from
any alternate names for the same file.  This has nothing to do with
Emacs&mdash;the version control system does it.

<h4 class="subsection">18.3.3 Customizing Saving of Files</h4>

<p><a name="index-require_002dfinal_002dnewline-1199"></a>  If the value of the variable <code>require-final-newline</code> is
<code>t</code>, saving or writing a file silently puts a newline at the end
if there isn't already one there.  If the value is <code>visit</code>, Emacs
adds a newline at the end of any file that doesn't have one, just
after it visits the file.  (This marks the buffer as modified, and you
can undo it.)  If the value is <code>visit-save</code>, Emacs adds such
newlines both on visiting and on saving.  If the value is <code>nil</code>,
Emacs leaves the end of the file unchanged; any other non-<code>nil</code>
value means to asks you whether to add a newline.  The default is
<code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-mode_002drequire_002dfinal_002dnewline-1200"></a>  Some major modes are designed for specific kinds of files that are
always supposed to end in newlines.  Such major modes set the variable
<code>require-final-newline</code> to the value of
<code>mode-require-final-newline</code>, which defaults to <code>t</code>.  By
setting the latter variable, you can control how these modes handle
final newlines.

   <p><a name="index-write_002dregion_002dinhibit_002dfsync-1201"></a>  Normally, when a program writes a file, the operating system briefly
caches the file's data in main memory before committing the data to
disk.  This can greatly improve performance; for example, when running
on laptops, it can avoid a disk spin-up each time a file is written. 
However, it risks data loss if the operating system crashes before
committing the cache to disk.

   <p>To lessen this risk, Emacs can invoke the <code>fsync</code> system call
after saving a file.  Using <code>fsync</code> does not eliminate the risk
of data loss, partly because many systems do not implement
<code>fsync</code> properly, and partly because Emacs's file-saving
procedure typically relies also on directory updates that might not
survive a crash even if <code>fsync</code> works properly.

   <p>The <code>write-region-inhibit-fsync</code> variable controls whether
Emacs invokes <code>fsync</code> after saving a file.  The variable's
default value is <code>nil</code> when Emacs is interactive, and <code>t</code>
when Emacs runs in batch mode.

   <p>Emacs never uses <code>fsync</code> when writing auto-save files, as these
files might lose data anyway.

<h4 class="subsection">18.3.4 Protection against Simultaneous Editing</h4>

<p><a name="index-file-dates-1202"></a><a name="index-simultaneous-editing-1203"></a>  Simultaneous editing occurs when two users visit the same file, both
make changes, and then both save them.  If nobody is informed that
this is happening, whichever user saves first would later find that
his changes were lost.

   <p>On some systems, Emacs notices immediately when the second user starts
to change the file, and issues an immediate warning.  On all systems,
Emacs checks when you save the file, and warns if you are about to
overwrite another user's changes.  You can prevent loss of the other
user's work by taking the proper corrective action instead of saving the
file.

   <p><a name="index-ask_002duser_002dabout_002dlock-1204"></a><a name="index-locking-files-1205"></a>  When you make the first modification in an Emacs buffer that is
visiting a file, Emacs records that the file is <dfn>locked</dfn> by you. 
(It does this by creating a specially-named symbolic link<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-7" name="fnd-7"><sup>7</sup></a> with special contents in the same directory.)  Emacs removes the lock
when you save the changes.  The idea is that the file is locked
whenever an Emacs buffer visiting it has unsaved changes.

   <p><a name="index-create_002dlockfiles-1206"></a>  You can prevent the creation of lock files by setting the variable
<code>create-lockfiles</code> to <code>nil</code>.  <strong>Caution:</strong> by
doing so you will lose the benefits that this feature provides.

   <p><a name="index-collision-1207"></a>  If you begin to modify the buffer while the visited file is locked by
someone else, this constitutes a <dfn>collision</dfn>.  When Emacs detects a
collision, it asks you what to do, by calling the Lisp function
<code>ask-user-about-lock</code>.  You can redefine this function for the sake
of customization.  The standard definition of this function asks you a
question and accepts three possible answers:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>s</kbd><dd>Steal the lock.  Whoever was already changing the file loses the lock,
and you gain the lock. 
<br><dt><kbd>p</kbd><dd>Proceed.  Go ahead and edit the file despite its being locked by someone else. 
<br><dt><kbd>q</kbd><dd>Quit.  This causes an error (<code>file-locked</code>), and the buffer
contents remain unchanged&mdash;the modification you were trying to make
does not actually take place. 
</dl>

   <p>If Emacs or the operating system crashes, this may leave behind lock
files which are stale, so you may occasionally get warnings about
spurious collisions.  When you determine that the collision is
spurious, just use <kbd>p</kbd> to tell Emacs to go ahead anyway.

   <p>Note that locking works on the basis of a file name; if a file has
multiple names, Emacs does not prevent two users from editing it
simultaneously under different names.

   <p>A lock file cannot be written in some circumstances, e.g., if Emacs
lacks the system permissions or cannot create lock files for some
other reason.  In these cases, Emacs can still detect the collision
when you try to save a file, by checking the file's last-modification
date.  If the file has changed since the last time Emacs visited or
saved it, that implies that changes have been made in some other way,
and will be lost if Emacs proceeds with saving.  Emacs then displays a
warning message and asks for confirmation before saving; answer
<kbd>yes</kbd> to save, and <kbd>no</kbd> or <kbd>C-g</kbd> cancel the save.

   <p>If you are notified that simultaneous editing has already taken

   <p>You can arrange to keep identical <dfn>shadow</dfn> copies of certain files
in more than one place&mdash;possibly on different machines.  To do this,
first you must set up a <dfn>shadow file group</dfn>, which is a set of
identically-named files shared between a list of sites.  The file
group is permanent and applies to further Emacs sessions as well as
the current one.  Once the group is set up, every time you exit Emacs,
it will copy the file you edited to the other files in its group.  You
can also do the copying without exiting Emacs, by typing <kbd>M-x
shadow-copy-files</kbd>.

   <p>To set up a shadow file group, use <kbd>M-x
shadow-define-literal-group</kbd> or <kbd>M-x shadow-define-regexp-group</kbd>. 
See their documentation strings for further information.

   <p>Before copying a file to its shadows, Emacs asks for confirmation. 
You can answer &ldquo;no&rdquo; to bypass copying of this file, this time.  If
you want to cancel the shadowing permanently for a certain file, use
<kbd>M-x shadow-cancel</kbd> to eliminate or change the shadow file group.

   <p>A <dfn>shadow cluster</dfn> is a group of hosts that share directories, so
that copying to or from one of them is sufficient to update the file
on all of them.  Each shadow cluster has a name, and specifies the
network address of a primary host (the one we copy files to), and a
regular expression that matches the host names of all the other hosts
in the cluster.  You can define a shadow cluster with <kbd>M-x
shadow-define-cluster</kbd>.

<p><a name="index-time-stamps-1211"></a><a name="index-modification-dates-1212"></a><a name="index-locale_002c-date-format-1213"></a>
You can arrange to put a time stamp in a file, so that it is updated
automatically each time you edit and save the file.  The time stamp
must be in the first eight lines of the file, and you should insert it
like this:

<pre class="example">     Time-stamp: &lt;&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">or like this:

<pre class="example">     Time-stamp: " "
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-time_002dstamp-1214"></a>  Then add the function <code>time-stamp</code> to the hook
<code>before-save-hook</code> (see <a href="#Hooks">Hooks</a>).  When you save the file, this
function then automatically updates the time stamp with the current
date and time.  You can also use the command <kbd>M-x time-stamp</kbd> to
update the time stamp manually.  By default the time stamp is
formatted according to your locale setting (see <a href="#Environment">Environment</a>) and
time zone (see <a href="elisp.html#Time-of-Day">Time of Day</a>).  For customizations, see the Custom group <code>time-stamp</code>.

<h3 class="section">18.4 Reverting a Buffer</h3>

<p><a name="index-revert_002dbuffer-1215"></a><a name="index-drastic-changes-1216"></a><a name="index-reread-a-file-1217"></a>
  If you have made extensive changes to a file-visiting buffer and
then change your mind, you can <dfn>revert</dfn> the changes and go back to
the saved version of the file.  To do this, type <kbd>M-x
revert-buffer</kbd>.  Since reverting unintentionally could lose a lot of
work, Emacs asks for confirmation first.

   <p>The <code>revert-buffer</code> command tries to position point in such a
way that, if the file was edited only slightly, you will be at
approximately the same part of the text as before.  But if you have
made major changes, point may end up in a totally different location.

   <p>Reverting marks the buffer as not modified.  It also clears the
buffer's undo history (see <a href="#Undo">Undo</a>).  Thus, the reversion cannot be
undone&mdash;if you change your mind yet again, you can't use the undo
commands to bring the reverted changes back.

   <p>Some kinds of buffers that are not associated with files, such as
Dired buffers, can also be reverted.  For them, reverting means
recalculating their contents.  Buffers created explicitly with
<kbd>C-x b</kbd> cannot be reverted; <code>revert-buffer</code> reports an error
if you try.

   <p><a name="index-revert_002dwithout_002dquery-1218"></a>  When you edit a file that changes automatically and frequently&mdash;for
example, a log of output from a process that continues to run&mdash;it may
be useful for Emacs to revert the file without querying you.  To
request this behavior, set the variable <code>revert-without-query</code> to
a list of regular expressions.  When a file name matches one of these
regular expressions, <code>find-file</code> and <code>revert-buffer</code> will
revert it automatically if it has changed&mdash;provided the buffer itself
is not modified.  (If you have edited the text, it would be wrong to
discard your changes.)

   <p><a name="index-Global-Auto_002dRevert-mode-1219"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Global-Auto_002dRevert-1220"></a><a name="index-Auto_002dRevert-mode-1221"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Auto_002dRevert-1222"></a><a name="index-global_002dauto_002drevert_002dmode-1223"></a><a name="index-auto_002drevert_002dmode-1224"></a><a name="index-auto_002drevert_002dtail_002dmode-1225"></a><a name="index-auto_002drevert_002dinterval-1226"></a>  You can also tell Emacs to revert buffers periodically.  To do this
for a specific buffer, enable the minor mode Auto-Revert mode by
typing <kbd>M-x auto-revert-mode</kbd>.  This automatically reverts the
current buffer every five seconds; you can change the interval through
the variable <code>auto-revert-interval</code>.  To do the same for all file
buffers, type <kbd>M-x global-auto-revert-mode</kbd> to enable Global
Auto-Revert mode.  These minor modes do not check or revert remote
files, because that is usually too slow.

   <p>One use of Auto-Revert mode is to &ldquo;tail&rdquo; a file such as a system
log, so that changes made to that file by other programs are
continuously displayed.  To do this, just move the point to the end of
the buffer, and it will stay there as the file contents change. 
However, if you are sure that the file will only change by growing at
the end, use Auto-Revert Tail mode instead
(<code>auto-revert-tail-mode</code>).  It is more efficient for this. 
Auto-Revert Tail mode works also for remote files.

   <p>See <a href="#VC-Undo">VC Undo</a>, for commands to revert to earlier versions of files
under version control.  See <a href="#VC-Mode-Line">VC Mode Line</a>, for Auto Revert
peculiarities when visiting files under version control.

<h3 class="section">18.5 Auto Reverting Non-File Buffers</h3>

<p>Global Auto Revert Mode normally only reverts file buffers.  There are
two ways to auto-revert certain non-file buffers: by enabling Auto
Revert Mode in those buffers (using <kbd>M-x auto-revert-mode</kbd>); and
by setting <code>global-auto-revert-non-file-buffers</code> to a
non-<code>nil</code> value.  The latter enables Auto Reverting for all types
of buffers for which it is implemented (listed in the menu below).

   <p>Like file buffers, non-file buffers should normally not revert while
you are working on them, or while they contain information that might
get lost after reverting.  Therefore, they do not revert if they are
modified.  This can get tricky, because deciding when a non-file
buffer should be marked modified is usually more difficult than for
file buffers.

   <p>Another tricky detail is that, for efficiency reasons, Auto Revert
often does not try to detect all possible changes in the buffer, only
changes that are major or easy to detect.  Hence, enabling
auto-reverting for a non-file buffer does not always guarantee that
all information in the buffer is up-to-date, and does not necessarily
make manual reverts useless.

   <p>At the other extreme, certain buffers automatically revert every
<code>auto-revert-interval</code> seconds.  (This currently only applies to
the Buffer Menu.)  In this case, Auto Revert does not print any
messages while reverting, even when <code>auto-revert-verbose</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>.

   <p>The details depend on the particular types of buffers and are
explained in the corresponding sections.

<h4 class="subsection">18.5.1 Auto Reverting the Buffer Menu</h4>

<p>If auto-reverting of non-file buffers is enabled, the Buffer Menu
(see <a href="#Several-Buffers">Several Buffers</a>) automatically reverts every
<code>auto-revert-interval</code> seconds, whether there is a need for it or
not.  (It would probably take longer to check whether there is a need
than to actually revert.)

   <p>If the Buffer Menu inappropriately gets marked modified, just revert
it manually using <kbd>g</kbd> and auto-reverting will resume.  However, if
you marked certain buffers to get deleted or to be displayed, you have
to be careful, because reverting erases all marks.  The fact that
adding marks sets the buffer's modified flag prevents Auto Revert from
automatically erasing the marks.

<h4 class="subsection">18.5.2 Auto Reverting Dired buffers</h4>

<p>Auto-reverting Dired buffers currently works on GNU or Unix style
operating systems.  It may not work satisfactorily on some other
systems.

   <p>Dired buffers only auto-revert when the file list of the buffer's main
directory changes (e.g., when a new file is added).  They do not
auto-revert when information about a particular file changes
(e.g., when the size changes) or when inserted subdirectories change. 
To be sure that <em>all</em> listed information is up to date, you have
to manually revert using <kbd>g</kbd>, <em>even</em> if auto-reverting is
enabled in the Dired buffer.  Sometimes, you might get the impression
that modifying or saving files listed in the main directory actually
does cause auto-reverting.  This is because making changes to a file,
or saving it, very often causes changes in the directory itself; for
instance, through backup files or auto-save files.  However, this is
not guaranteed.

   <p>If the Dired buffer is marked modified and there are no changes you
want to protect, then most of the time you can make auto-reverting
resume by manually reverting the buffer using <kbd>g</kbd>.  There is one
exception.  If you flag or mark files, you can safely revert the
buffer.  This will not erase the flags or marks (unless the marked
file has been deleted, of course).  However, the buffer will stay
modified, even after reverting, and auto-reverting will not resume. 
This is because, if you flag or mark files, you may be working on the
buffer and you might not want the buffer to change without warning. 
If you want auto-reverting to resume in the presence of marks and
flags, mark the buffer non-modified using <kbd>M-~</kbd>.  However, adding,
deleting or changing marks or flags will mark it modified again.

   <p>Remote Dired buffers are not auto-reverted (because it may be slow). 
Neither are Dired buffers for which you used shell wildcards or file
arguments to list only some of the files.  <samp><span class="file">*Find*</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">*Locate*</span></samp> buffers do not auto-revert either.

<h4 class="subsection">18.5.3 Adding Support for Auto-Reverting additional Buffers.</h4>

<p>This section is intended for Elisp programmers who would like to add
support for auto-reverting new types of buffers.

   <p>To support auto-reverting the buffer must first of all have a suitable
<code>revert-buffer-function</code>.  See <a href="elisp.html#Definition-of-revert_002dbuffer_002dfunction">Reverting</a>.

   <p>In addition, it must have a suitable <code>buffer-stale-function</code>.

<!-- FIXME only defvar in all of doc/emacs! -->
<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>buffer-stale-function</b><var><a name="index-buffer_002dstale_002dfunction-1227"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this variable is a function to check whether a
buffer needs reverting.  This should be a function with one optional
argument <var>noconfirm</var>.  The function should return non-<code>nil</code>
if the buffer should be reverted.  The buffer is current when this
function is called.

        <p>While this function is mainly intended for use in auto-reverting, it
could be used for other purposes as well.  For instance, if
auto-reverting is not enabled, it could be used to warn the user that
the buffer needs reverting.  The idea behind the <var>noconfirm</var>
argument is that it should be <code>t</code> if the buffer is going to be
reverted without asking the user and <code>nil</code> if the function is
just going to be used to warn the user that the buffer is out of date. 
In particular, for use in auto-reverting, <var>noconfirm</var> is <code>t</code>. 
If the function is only going to be used for auto-reverting, you can
ignore the <var>noconfirm</var> argument.

        <p>If you just want to automatically auto-revert every
<code>auto-revert-interval</code> seconds (like the Buffer Menu), use:

     <pre class="example">          (setq-local buffer-stale-function
               #'(lambda (&amp;optional noconfirm) 'fast))
     </pre>
        <p class="noindent">in the buffer's mode function.

        <p>The special return value `<samp><span class="samp">fast</span></samp>' tells the caller that the need
for reverting was not checked, but that reverting the buffer is fast. 
It also tells Auto Revert not to print any revert messages, even if
<code>auto-revert-verbose</code> is non-<code>nil</code>.  This is important, as
getting revert messages every <code>auto-revert-interval</code> seconds can
be very annoying.  The information provided by this return value could
also be useful if the function is consulted for purposes other than
auto-reverting. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Once the buffer has a suitable <code>revert-buffer-function</code> and
<code>buffer-stale-function</code>, several problems usually remain.

   <p>The buffer will only auto-revert if it is marked unmodified.  Hence,
you will have to make sure that various functions mark the buffer
modified if and only if either the buffer contains information that
might be lost by reverting, or there is reason to believe that the user
might be inconvenienced by auto-reverting, because he is actively
working on the buffer.  The user can always override this by manually
adjusting the modified status of the buffer.  To support this, calling
the <code>revert-buffer-function</code> on a buffer that is marked
unmodified should always keep the buffer marked unmodified.

   <p>It is important to assure that point does not continuously jump around
as a consequence of auto-reverting.  Of course, moving point might be
inevitable if the buffer radically changes.

   <p>You should make sure that the <code>revert-buffer-function</code> does not
print messages that unnecessarily duplicate Auto Revert's own messages,
displayed if <code>auto-revert-verbose</code> is <code>t</code>, and effectively
override a <code>nil</code> value for <code>auto-revert-verbose</code>.  Hence,
adapting a mode for auto-reverting often involves getting rid of such
messages.  This is especially important for buffers that automatically
revert every <code>auto-revert-interval</code> seconds.

   <p>If the new auto-reverting is part of Emacs, you should mention it
in the documentation string of <code>global-auto-revert-non-file-buffers</code>.

   <p>Similarly, you should add a section to this chapter.  This section
should at the very least make clear whether enabling auto-reverting
for the buffer reliably assures that all information in the buffer is
completely up to date (or will be after <code>auto-revert-interval</code>
seconds).

  From time to time, Emacs automatically saves each visited file in a
separate file, without altering the file you actually use.  This is
called <dfn>auto-saving</dfn>.  It prevents you from losing more than a
limited amount of work if the system crashes.

   <p>When Emacs determines that it is time for auto-saving, it considers
each buffer, and each is auto-saved if auto-saving is enabled for it
and it has been changed since the last time it was auto-saved.  The
message `<samp><span class="samp">Auto-saving...</span></samp>' is displayed in the echo area during
auto-saving, if any files are actually auto-saved.  Errors occurring
during auto-saving are caught so that they do not interfere with the
execution of commands you have been typing.

<h4 class="subsection">18.6.1 Auto-Save Files</h4>

<p>Auto-saving does not normally save in the files that you visited,
because it can be very undesirable to save a change that you did not
want to make permanent.  Instead, auto-saving is done in a different
file called the <dfn>auto-save file</dfn>, and the visited file is changed
only when you request saving explicitly (such as with <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd>).

   <p>Normally, the auto-save file name is made by appending `<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>' to the
front and rear of the visited file name.  Thus, a buffer visiting file
<samp><span class="file">foo.c</span></samp> is auto-saved in a file <samp><span class="file">#foo.c#</span></samp>.  Most buffers that
are not visiting files are auto-saved only if you request it explicitly;
when they are auto-saved, the auto-save file name is made by appending
`<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>' to the front and rear of buffer name, then
adding digits and letters at the end for uniqueness.  For
example, the <samp><span class="file">*mail*</span></samp> buffer in which you compose messages to be
sent might be auto-saved in a file named <samp><span class="file">#*mail*#704juu</span></samp>.  Auto-save file
names are made this way unless you reprogram parts of Emacs to do
something different (the functions <code>make-auto-save-file-name</code> and
<code>auto-save-file-name-p</code>).  The file name to be used for auto-saving
in a buffer is calculated when auto-saving is turned on in that buffer.

   <p><a name="index-auto_002dsave-for-remote-files-1231"></a><a name="index-auto_002dsave_002dfile_002dname_002dtransforms-1232"></a>  The variable <code>auto-save-file-name-transforms</code> allows a degree
of control over the auto-save file name.  It lets you specify a series
of regular expressions and replacements to transform the auto save
file name.  The default value puts the auto-save files for remote
files (see <a href="#Remote-Files">Remote Files</a>) into the temporary file directory on the
local machine.

   <p>When you delete a substantial part of the text in a large buffer, auto
save turns off temporarily in that buffer.  This is because if you
deleted the text unintentionally, you might find the auto-save file more
useful if it contains the deleted text.  To reenable auto-saving after
this happens, save the buffer with <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd>, or use <kbd>C-u 1 M-x
auto-save-mode</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-auto_002dsave_002dvisited_002dfile_002dname-1233"></a>  If you want auto-saving to be done in the visited file rather than
in a separate auto-save file, set the variable
<code>auto-save-visited-file-name</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> value.  In this
mode, there is no real difference between auto-saving and explicit
saving.

   <p><a name="index-delete_002dauto_002dsave_002dfiles-1234"></a>  A buffer's auto-save file is deleted when you save the buffer in its
visited file.  (You can inhibit this by setting the variable
<code>delete-auto-save-files</code> to <code>nil</code>.)  Changing the visited
file name with <kbd>C-x C-w</kbd> or <code>set-visited-file-name</code> renames
any auto-save file to go with the new visited name.

<h4 class="subsection">18.6.2 Controlling Auto-Saving</h4>

<p><a name="index-auto_002dsave_002ddefault-1235"></a><a name="index-auto_002dsave_002dmode-1236"></a>  Each time you visit a file, auto-saving is turned on for that file's
buffer if the variable <code>auto-save-default</code> is non-<code>nil</code> (but
not in batch mode; see <a href="#Initial-Options">Initial Options</a>).  The default for this
variable is <code>t</code>, so auto-saving is the usual practice for
file-visiting buffers.  To toggle auto-saving in the current buffer,
type <kbd>M-x auto-save-mode</kbd>.  Auto Save mode acts as a buffer-local
minor mode (see <a href="#Minor-Modes">Minor Modes</a>).

   <p><a name="index-auto_002dsave_002dinterval-1237"></a>  Emacs auto-saves periodically based on how many characters you have
typed since the last auto-save.  The variable
<code>auto-save-interval</code> specifies how many characters there are
between auto-saves.  By default, it is 300.  Emacs doesn't accept
values that are too small: if you customize <code>auto-save-interval</code>
to a value less than 20, Emacs will behave as if the value is 20.

   <p><a name="index-auto_002dsave_002dtimeout-1238"></a>  Auto-saving also takes place when you stop typing for a while.  By
default, it does this after 30 seconds of idleness (at this time,
Emacs may also perform garbage collection; see <a href="elisp.html#Garbage-Collection">Garbage Collection</a>).  To change
this interval, customize the variable <code>auto-save-timeout</code>.  The
actual time period is longer if the current buffer is long; this is a
heuristic which aims to keep out of your way when you are editing long
buffers, in which auto-save takes an appreciable amount of time. 
Auto-saving during idle periods accomplishes two things: first, it
makes sure all your work is saved if you go away from the terminal for
a while; second, it may avoid some auto-saving while you are actually
typing.

   <p>Emacs also does auto-saving whenever it gets a fatal error.  This
includes killing the Emacs job with a shell command such as `<samp><span class="samp">kill
%emacs</span></samp>', or disconnecting a phone line or network connection.

   <p><a name="index-do_002dauto_002dsave-1239"></a>  You can perform an auto-save explicitly with the command <kbd>M-x

<h4 class="subsection">18.6.3 Recovering Data from Auto-Saves</h4>

<p><a name="index-recover_002dfile-1240"></a>  You can use the contents of an auto-save file to recover from a loss
of data with the command <kbd>M-x recover-file &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>file</var><kbd>
&lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.  This visits <var>file</var> and then (after your confirmation)
restores the contents from its auto-save file <samp><span class="file">#</span><var>file</var><span class="file">#</span></samp>. 
You can then save with <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd> to put the recovered text into
<var>file</var> itself.  For example, to recover file <samp><span class="file">foo.c</span></samp> from its
auto-save file <samp><span class="file">#foo.c#</span></samp>, do:

<pre class="example">     M-x recover-file &lt;RET&gt; foo.c &lt;RET&gt;
     yes &lt;RET&gt;
     C-x C-s
</pre>
   <p>Before asking for confirmation, <kbd>M-x recover-file</kbd> displays a
directory listing describing the specified file and the auto-save file,
so you can compare their sizes and dates.  If the auto-save file
is older, <kbd>M-x recover-file</kbd> does not offer to read it.

   <p><a name="index-recover_002dsession-1241"></a>  If Emacs or the computer crashes, you can recover all the files you
were editing from their auto save files with the command <kbd>M-x
recover-session</kbd>.  This first shows you a list of recorded interrupted
sessions.  Move point to the one you choose, and type <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>.

   <p>Then <code>recover-session</code> asks about each of the files that were
being edited during that session, asking whether to recover that file. 
If you answer <kbd>y</kbd>, it calls <code>recover-file</code>, which works in its
normal fashion.  It shows the dates of the original file and its
auto-save file, and asks once again whether to recover that file.

   <p>When <code>recover-session</code> is done, the files you've chosen to
recover are present in Emacs buffers.  You should then save them.  Only
this&mdash;saving them&mdash;updates the files themselves.

   <p><a name="index-auto_002dsave_002dlist_002dfile_002dprefix-1242"></a>  Emacs records information about interrupted sessions in files named
<samp><span class="file">.saves-</span><var>pid</var><span class="file">-</span><var>hostname</var></samp> in the directory
<samp><span class="file">~/.emacs.d/auto-save-list/</span></samp>.  This directory is determined by
the variable <code>auto-save-list-file-prefix</code>.  If you set
<code>auto-save-list-file-prefix</code> to <code>nil</code>, sessions are not
recorded for recovery.

<h3 class="section">18.7 File Name Aliases</h3>

<p><a name="index-symbolic-links-_0028visiting_0029-1243"></a><a name="index-hard-links-_0028visiting_0029-1244"></a>
  Symbolic links and hard links both make it possible for several file
names to refer to the same file.  Hard links are alternate names that
refer directly to the file; all the names are equally valid, and no one
of them is preferred.  By contrast, a symbolic link is a kind of defined
alias: when <samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp> is a symbolic link to <samp><span class="file">bar</span></samp>, you can use
either name to refer to the file, but <samp><span class="file">bar</span></samp> is the real name, while
<samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp> is just an alias.  More complex cases occur when symbolic
links point to directories.

   <p><a name="index-find_002dfile_002dexisting_002dother_002dname-1245"></a><a name="index-find_002dfile_002dsuppress_002dsame_002dfile_002dwarnings-1246"></a>  Normally, if you visit a file which Emacs is already visiting under
a different name, Emacs displays a message in the echo area and uses
the existing buffer visiting that file.  This can happen on systems
that support hard or symbolic links, or if you use a long file name on
a system that truncates long file names, or on a case-insensitive file
system.  You can suppress the message by setting the variable
<code>find-file-suppress-same-file-warnings</code> to a non-<code>nil</code>
value.  You can disable this feature entirely by setting the variable
<code>find-file-existing-other-name</code> to <code>nil</code>: then if you visit
the same file under two different names, you get a separate buffer for
each file name.

   <p><a name="index-find_002dfile_002dvisit_002dtruename-1247"></a><a name="index-truenames-of-files-1248"></a><a name="index-file-truenames-1249"></a>  If the variable <code>find-file-visit-truename</code> is non-<code>nil</code>,
then the file name recorded for a buffer is the file's <dfn>truename</dfn>
(made by replacing all symbolic links with their target names), rather
than the name you specify.  Setting <code>find-file-visit-truename</code> also
implies the effect of <code>find-file-existing-other-name</code>.

   <p><a name="index-directory-name-abbreviation-1250"></a><a name="index-directory_002dabbrev_002dalist-1251"></a>  Sometimes, a directory is ordinarily accessed through a symbolic
link, and you may want Emacs to preferentially show its linked
name.  To do this, customize <code>directory-abbrev-alist</code>.  Each
element in this list should have the form <code>(</code><var>from</var><code>
. </code><var>to</var><code>)</code>, which means to replace <var>from</var> with <var>to</var> whenever
<var>from</var> appears in a directory name.  The <var>from</var> string is a
regular expression (see <a href="#Regexps">Regexps</a>).  It is matched against directory
names anchored at the first character, and should start with `<samp><span class="samp">\`</span></samp>'
(to support directory names with embedded newlines, which would defeat
`<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>').  The <var>to</var> string should be an ordinary absolute
directory name pointing to the same directory.  Do not use `<samp><span class="samp">~</span></samp>' to
stand for a home directory in the <var>to</var> string; Emacs performs
these substitutions separately.  Here's an example, from a system on
which <samp><span class="file">/home/fsf</span></samp> is normally accessed through a symbolic link
named <samp><span class="file">/fsf</span></samp>:

<pre class="example">     (("\\`/home/fsf" . "/fsf"))

<h3 class="section">18.8 File Directories</h3>

<p><a name="index-file-directory-1252"></a><a name="index-directory-listing-1253"></a>  The file system groups files into <dfn>directories</dfn>.  A <dfn>directory
listing</dfn> is a list of all the files in a directory.  Emacs provides
commands to create and delete directories, and to make directory
listings in brief format (file names only) and verbose format (sizes,
dates, and authors included).  Emacs also includes a directory browser
feature called Dired; see <a href="#Dired">Dired</a>.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x C-d </kbd><var>dir-or-pattern</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Display a brief directory listing (<code>list-directory</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-u C-x C-d </kbd><var>dir-or-pattern</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Display a verbose directory listing. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x make-directory &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>dirname</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Create a new directory named <var>dirname</var>. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x delete-directory &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>dirname</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Delete the directory named <var>dirname</var>.  If it isn't empty,
you will be asked whether you want to delete it recursively. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-list_002ddirectory-1254"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dd-1255"></a>  The command to display a directory listing is <kbd>C-x C-d</kbd>
(<code>list-directory</code>).  It reads using the minibuffer a file name
which is either a directory to be listed or a wildcard-containing
pattern for the files to be listed.  For example,

<pre class="example">     C-x C-d /u2/emacs/etc &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">lists all the files in directory <samp><span class="file">/u2/emacs/etc</span></samp>.  Here is an
example of specifying a file name pattern:

<pre class="example">     C-x C-d /u2/emacs/src/*.c &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>
   <p>Normally, <kbd>C-x C-d</kbd> displays a brief directory listing containing
just file names.  A numeric argument (regardless of value) tells it to
make a verbose listing including sizes, dates, and owners (like
`<samp><span class="samp">ls -l</span></samp>').

   <p><a name="index-list_002ddirectory_002dbrief_002dswitches-1256"></a><a name="index-list_002ddirectory_002dverbose_002dswitches-1257"></a>  The text of a directory listing is mostly obtained by running
<code>ls</code> in an inferior process.  Two Emacs variables control the
switches passed to <code>ls</code>: <code>list-directory-brief-switches</code> is
a string giving the switches to use in brief listings (<code>"-CF"</code> by
default), and <code>list-directory-verbose-switches</code> is a string
giving the switches to use in a verbose listing (<code>"-l"</code> by
default).

   <p><a name="index-directory_002dfree_002dspace_002dprogram-1258"></a><a name="index-directory_002dfree_002dspace_002dargs-1259"></a>  In verbose directory listings, Emacs adds information about the
amount of free space on the disk that contains the directory.  To do
this, it runs the program specified by
<code>directory-free-space-program</code> with arguments
<code>directory-free-space-args</code>.

   <p>The command <kbd>M-x delete-directory</kbd> prompts for a directory name
using the minibuffer, and deletes the directory if it is empty.  If
the directory is not empty, you will be asked whether you want to
delete it recursively.  On systems that have a &ldquo;Trash&rdquo; (or &ldquo;Recycle
Bin&rdquo;) feature, you can make this command move the specified directory
to the Trash instead of deleting it outright, by changing the variable
<code>delete-by-moving-to-trash</code> to <code>t</code>.  See <a href="#Misc-File-Ops">Misc File Ops</a>,
for more information about using the Trash.

<h3 class="section">18.9 Comparing Files</h3>

<p><a name="index-comparing-files-1260"></a>
<a name="index-diff-1261"></a><a name="index-diff_002dswitches-1262"></a>  The command <kbd>M-x diff</kbd> prompts for two file names, using the
minibuffer, and displays the differences between the two files in a
buffer named <samp><span class="file">*diff*</span></samp>.  This works by running the <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp>
program, using options taken from the variable <code>diff-switches</code>. 
The value of <code>diff-switches</code> should be a string; the default is
<code>"-u"</code> to specify a unified context diff. 
<!-- Note that the actual name of the info file is diffutils.info, -->
<!-- but it adds a dir entry for diff too. -->
<!-- On older systems, only "info diff" works, not "info diffutils". -->
See <a href="diffutils.html#Top">Diff</a>, for more
information about the <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp> program.

   <p>The output of the <code>diff</code> command is shown using a major mode
called Diff mode.  See <a href="#Diff-Mode">Diff Mode</a>.

   <p><a name="index-diff_002dbackup-1263"></a>  The command <kbd>M-x diff-backup</kbd> compares a specified file with its
most recent backup.  If you specify the name of a backup file,
<code>diff-backup</code> compares it with the source file that it is a
backup of.  In all other respects, this behaves like <kbd>M-x diff</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-diff_002dbuffer_002dwith_002dfile-1264"></a>  The command <kbd>M-x diff-buffer-with-file</kbd> compares a specified
buffer with its corresponding file.  This shows you what changes you
would make to the file if you save the buffer.

   <p><a name="index-compare_002dwindows-1265"></a>  The command <kbd>M-x compare-windows</kbd> compares the text in the
current window with that in the window that was the selected window
before you selected the current one.  (For more information about
windows in Emacs, <a href="#Windows">Windows</a>.)  Comparison starts at point in each
window, after pushing each initial point value on the mark ring in its
respective buffer.  Then it moves point forward in each window, one
character at a time, until it reaches characters that don't match. 
Then the command exits.

   <p>If point in the two windows is followed by non-matching text when
the command starts, <kbd>M-x compare-windows</kbd> tries heuristically to
advance up to matching text in the two windows, and then exits.  So if
you use <kbd>M-x compare-windows</kbd> repeatedly, each time it either
skips one matching range or finds the start of another.

   <p><a name="index-compare_002dignore_002dcase-1266"></a><a name="index-compare_002dignore_002dwhitespace-1267"></a>  With a numeric argument, <code>compare-windows</code> ignores changes in
whitespace.  If the variable <code>compare-ignore-case</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>, the comparison ignores differences in case as well. 
If the variable <code>compare-ignore-whitespace</code> is non-<code>nil</code>,
<code>compare-windows</code> normally ignores changes in whitespace, and a
prefix argument turns that off.

mode for editing output from the <samp><span class="command">diff3</span></samp> program.  This is
typically the result of a failed merge from a version control system
update outside VC, due to conflicting changes to a file.  Smerge
mode provides commands to resolve conflicts by selecting specific
changes.

<h3 class="section">18.10 Diff Mode</h3>

<p><a name="index-Diff-mode-1273"></a><a name="index-diff_002dmode-1274"></a><a name="index-patches_002c-editing-1275"></a>
  Diff mode is a major mode used for the output of <kbd>M-x diff</kbd> and
other similar commands.  This kind of output is called a <dfn>patch</dfn>,
because it can be passed to the <samp><span class="command">patch</span></samp> command to
automatically apply the specified changes.  To select Diff mode
manually, type <kbd>M-x diff-mode</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-hunk_002c-diff-1276"></a>  The changes specified in a patch are grouped into <dfn>hunks</dfn>, which
are contiguous chunks of text that contain one or more changed lines. 
Hunks can also include unchanged lines to provide context for the
changes.  Each hunk is preceded by a <dfn>hunk header</dfn>, which
specifies the old and new line numbers at which the hunk occurs.  Diff
mode highlights each hunk header, to distinguish it from the actual
contents of the hunk.

   <p><a name="index-diff_002dupdate_002don_002dthe_002dfly-1277"></a>  You can edit a Diff mode buffer like any other buffer.  (If it is
read-only, you need to make it writable first.  See <a href="#Misc-Buffer">Misc Buffer</a>.) 
Whenever you change a hunk, Diff mode attempts to automatically
correct the line numbers in the hunk headers, to ensure that the patch
remains correct.  To disable automatic line number correction,
change the variable <code>diff-update-on-the-fly</code> to <code>nil</code>.

   <p>Diff mode treats each hunk as an error message, similar to
Compilation mode.  Thus, you can use commands such as <kbd>C-x `</kbd> to
visit the corresponding source locations.  See <a href="#Compilation-Mode">Compilation Mode</a>.

   <p>In addition, Diff mode provides the following commands to navigate,
manipulate and apply parts of patches:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-n</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002dhunk_002dnext-1278"></a>Move to the next hunk-start (<code>diff-hunk-next</code>).

     <p><a name="index-diff_002dauto_002drefine_002dmode-1279"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Diff-Auto_002dRefine-1280"></a><a name="index-Diff-Auto_002dRefine-mode-1281"></a>This command has a side effect: it <dfn>refines</dfn> the hunk you move to,
highlighting its changes with better granularity.  To disable this
feature, type <kbd>M-x diff-auto-refine-mode</kbd> to toggle off the minor
mode Diff Auto-Refine mode.  To disable Diff Auto Refine mode by
default, add this to your init file (see <a href="#Hooks">Hooks</a>):

     <pre class="example">          (add-hook 'diff-mode-hook
                    (lambda () (diff-auto-refine-mode -1)))
     </pre>
     <br><dt><kbd>M-p</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002dhunk_002dprev-1282"></a>Move to the previous hunk-start (<code>diff-hunk-prev</code>).  Like
<kbd>M-n</kbd>, this has the side-effect of refining the hunk you move to,
unless you disable Diff Auto-Refine mode.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-}</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002dfile_002dnext-1283"></a>Move to the next file-start, in a multi-file patch
(<code>diff-file-next</code>).

use <kbd>C-x n w</kbd> (<code>widen</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-r</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002dreverse_002ddirection-1293"></a>Reverse the direction of comparison for the entire buffer
(<code>diff-reverse-direction</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-s</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002dsplit_002dhunk-1294"></a>Split the hunk at point (<code>diff-split-hunk</code>).  This is for

the <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp> program.  If you need to split a hunk in the
<dfn>context diff format</dfn> produced by the <samp><span class="option">-c</span></samp> or

skeleton of the log of changes that you can later fill with the actual
descriptions of the changes.  <kbd>C-x 4 a</kbd> itself in Diff mode
operates on behalf of the current hunk's file, but gets the function
name from the patch itself.  This is useful for making log entries for
functions that are deleted by the patch. 
</dl>

<!-- Trailing whitespace is NOT shown by default. -->
<!-- Emacs's dir-locals file enables this (for some reason). -->
<p><a name="index-trailing-whitespace_002c-in-patches-1300"></a><a name="index-diff_002ddelete_002dtrailing_002dwhitespace-1301"></a>  Patches sometimes include trailing whitespace on modified lines, as
an unintentional and undesired change.  There are two ways to deal
with this problem.  Firstly, if you enable Whitespace mode in a Diff
buffer (see <a href="#Useless-Whitespace">Useless Whitespace</a>), it automatically highlights
trailing whitespace in modified lines.  Secondly, you can use the
command <kbd>M-x diff-delete-trailing-whitespace</kbd>, which searches for
trailing whitespace in the lines modified by the patch, and removes
that whitespace in both the patch and the patched source file(s). 
This command does not save the modifications that it makes, so you can
decide whether to save the changes (the list of modified files is
displayed in the echo area).  With a prefix argument, it tries to
modify the original source files rather than the patched source files.

<p>Emacs has commands for performing many other operations on files. 
All operate on one file; they do not accept wildcard file names.

   <p><a name="index-delete_002dfile-1302"></a><a name="index-deletion-_0028of-files_0029-1303"></a>  <kbd>M-x delete-file</kbd> prompts for a file and deletes it.  If you are
deleting many files in one directory, it may be more convenient to use
Dired rather than <code>delete-file</code>.  See <a href="#Dired-Deletion">Dired Deletion</a>.

   <p><a name="index-trash-1304"></a><a name="index-recycle-bin-1305"></a>  <kbd>M-x move-file-to-trash</kbd> moves a file into the system
<dfn>Trash</dfn> (or <dfn>Recycle Bin</dfn>).  This is a facility available on
most operating systems; files that are moved into the Trash can be
brought back later if you change your mind.

   <p><a name="index-delete_002dby_002dmoving_002dto_002dtrash-1306"></a>  By default, Emacs deletion commands do <em>not</em> use the Trash.  To
use the Trash (when it is available) for common deletion commands,
change the variable <code>delete-by-moving-to-trash</code> to <code>t</code>. 
This affects the commands <kbd>M-x delete-file</kbd> and <kbd>M-x
delete-directory</kbd> (see <a href="#Directories">Directories</a>), as well as the deletion
commands in Dired (see <a href="#Dired-Deletion">Dired Deletion</a>).  Supplying a prefix
argument to <kbd>M-x delete-file</kbd> or <kbd>M-x delete-directory</kbd> makes
them delete outright, instead of using the Trash, regardless of
<code>delete-by-moving-to-trash</code>.

   <p>If a file is under version control (see <a href="#Version-Control">Version Control</a>), you
should delete it using <kbd>M-x vc-delete-file</kbd> instead of <kbd>M-x
delete-file</kbd>.  See <a href="#VC-Delete_002fRename">VC Delete/Rename</a>.

   <p><a name="index-copy_002dfile-1307"></a><a name="index-copying-files-1308"></a>  <kbd>M-x copy-file</kbd> reads the file <var>old</var> and writes a new file
named <var>new</var> with the same contents.

   <p><a name="index-copy_002ddirectory-1309"></a>  <kbd>M-x copy-directory</kbd> copies directories, similar to the
<samp><span class="command">cp -r</span></samp> shell command.  It prompts for a directory <var>old</var>
and a destination <var>new</var>.  If <var>new</var> is an existing directory,
it creates a copy of the <var>old</var> directory and puts it in <var>new</var>. 
If <var>new</var> is not an existing directory, it copies all the contents
of <var>old</var> into a new directory named <var>new</var>.

   <p><a name="index-renaming-files-1310"></a><a name="index-rename_002dfile-1311"></a>  <kbd>M-x rename-file</kbd> reads two file names <var>old</var> and <var>new</var>
using the minibuffer, then renames file <var>old</var> as <var>new</var>.  If
the file name <var>new</var> already exists, you must confirm with
<kbd>yes</kbd> or renaming is not done; this is because renaming causes the
old meaning of the name <var>new</var> to be lost.  If <var>old</var> and
<var>new</var> are on different file systems, the file <var>old</var> is copied
and deleted.  If the argument <var>new</var> is just a directory name, the
real new name is in that directory, with the same non-directory
component as <var>old</var>.  For example, <kbd>M-x rename-file &lt;RET&gt;
~/foo &lt;RET&gt; /tmp &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> renames <samp><span class="file">~/foo</span></samp> to
<samp><span class="file">/tmp/foo</span></samp>.  The same rule applies to all the remaining commands
in this section.  All of them ask for confirmation when the new file
name already exists, too.

   <p>If a file is under version control (see <a href="#Version-Control">Version Control</a>), you
should rename it using <kbd>M-x vc-rename-file</kbd> instead of <kbd>M-x
rename-file</kbd>.  See <a href="#VC-Delete_002fRename">VC Delete/Rename</a>.

   <p><a name="index-add_002dname_002dto_002dfile-1312"></a><a name="index-hard-links-_0028creation_0029-1313"></a>  <kbd>M-x add-name-to-file</kbd> adds an additional name to an existing
file without removing its old name.  The new name is created as a
hard link to the existing file.  The new name must belong on the
same file system that the file is on.  On MS-Windows, this command
works only if the file resides in an NTFS file system.  On MS-DOS, it
works by copying the file.

   <p><a name="index-make_002dsymbolic_002dlink-1314"></a><a name="index-symbolic-links-_0028creation_0029-1315"></a>  <kbd>M-x make-symbolic-link</kbd> reads two file names <var>target</var> and
<var>linkname</var>, then creates a symbolic link named <var>linkname</var>,
which points at <var>target</var>.  The effect is that future attempts to
open file <var>linkname</var> will refer to whatever file is named
<var>target</var> at the time the opening is done, or will get an error if
the name <var>target</var> is nonexistent at that time.  This command does
not expand the argument <var>target</var>, so that it allows you to specify
a relative name as the target of the link.  On MS-Windows, this
command works only on MS Windows Vista and later.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-i-1316"></a><a name="index-insert_002dfile-1317"></a>  <kbd>M-x insert-file</kbd> (also <kbd>C-x i</kbd>) inserts a copy of the
contents of the specified file into the current buffer at point,
leaving point unchanged before the contents.  The position after the
inserted contents is added to the mark ring, without activating the
mark (see <a href="#Mark-Ring">Mark Ring</a>).

   <p><a name="index-insert_002dfile_002dliterally-1318"></a>  <kbd>M-x insert-file-literally</kbd> is like <kbd>M-x insert-file</kbd>,
except the file is inserted literally: it is treated as a sequence
of <acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters with no special encoding or conversion,
similar to the <kbd>M-x find-file-literally</kbd> command
(see <a href="#Visiting">Visiting</a>).

   <p><a name="index-write_002dregion-1319"></a>  <kbd>M-x write-region</kbd> is the inverse of <kbd>M-x insert-file</kbd>; it
copies the contents of the region into the specified file.  <kbd>M-x
append-to-file</kbd> adds the text of the region to the end of the
specified file.  See <a href="#Accumulating-Text">Accumulating Text</a>.  The variable
<code>write-region-inhibit-fsync</code> applies to these commands, as well
as saving files; see <a href="#Customize-Save">Customize Save</a>.

   <p><a name="index-set_002dfile_002dmodes-1320"></a><a name="index-file-modes-1321"></a><a name="index-file-permissions-1322"></a>  <kbd>M-x set-file-modes</kbd> reads a file name followed by a <dfn>file
mode</dfn>, and applies that file mode to the specified file.  File modes,
also called <dfn>file permissions</dfn>, determine whether a file can be
read, written to, or executed, and by whom.  This command reads file
modes using the same symbolic or octal format accepted by the
<samp><span class="command">chmod</span></samp> command; for instance, `<samp><span class="samp">u+x</span></samp>' means to add
execution permission for the user who owns the file.  It has no effect
on operating systems that do not support file modes.  <code>chmod</code> is a
convenience alias for this function.

<h3 class="section">18.12 Accessing Compressed Files</h3>

<p><a name="index-compression-1323"></a><a name="index-uncompression-1324"></a><a name="index-Auto-Compression-mode-1325"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Auto-Compression-1326"></a><a name="index-gzip-1327"></a>
  Emacs automatically uncompresses compressed files when you visit
them, and automatically recompresses them if you alter them and save
them.  Emacs recognizes compressed files by their file names.  File
names ending in `<samp><span class="samp">.gz</span></samp>' indicate a file compressed with
<code>gzip</code>.  Other endings indicate other compression programs.

   <p>Automatic uncompression and compression apply to all the operations in
which Emacs uses the contents of a file.  This includes visiting it,
saving it, inserting its contents into a buffer, loading it, and byte
compiling it.

   <p><a name="index-auto_002dcompression_002dmode-1328"></a><a name="index-auto_002dcompression_002dmode-1329"></a>  To disable this feature, type the command <kbd>M-x
auto-compression-mode</kbd>.  You can disable it permanently by
customizing the variable <code>auto-compression-mode</code>.

<h3 class="section">18.13 File Archives</h3>

<p><a name="index-mode_002c-tar-1330"></a><a name="index-Tar-mode-1331"></a><a name="index-file-archives-1332"></a>
  A file whose name ends in `<samp><span class="samp">.tar</span></samp>' is normally an <dfn>archive</dfn>
made by the <code>tar</code> program.  Emacs views these files in a special
mode called Tar mode which provides a Dired-like list of the contents
(see <a href="#Dired">Dired</a>).  You can move around through the list just as you
would in Dired, and visit the subfiles contained in the archive. 
However, not all Dired commands are available in Tar mode.

   <p>If Auto Compression mode is enabled (see <a href="#Compressed-Files">Compressed Files</a>), then
Tar mode is used also for compressed archives&mdash;files with extensions
`<samp><span class="samp">.tgz</span></samp>', <code>.tar.Z</code> and <code>.tar.gz</code>.

   <p>The keys <kbd>e</kbd>, <kbd>f</kbd> and &lt;RET&gt; all extract a component file
into its own buffer.  You can edit it there, and if you save the
buffer, the edited version will replace the version in the Tar buffer. 
Clicking with the mouse on the file name in the Tar buffer does
likewise.  <kbd>v</kbd> extracts a file into a buffer in View mode
(see <a href="#View-Mode">View Mode</a>).  <kbd>o</kbd> extracts the file and displays it in
another window, so you could edit the file and operate on the archive
simultaneously.

   <p>The <kbd>I</kbd> key adds a new (regular) file to the archive.  The file
is initially empty, but can readily be edited using the commands
above.  The command inserts the new file before the current one, so
that using it on the topmost line of the Tar buffer makes the new file
the first one in the archive, and using it at the end of the buffer
makes it the last one.

   <p><kbd>d</kbd> marks a file for deletion when you later use <kbd>x</kbd>, and
<kbd>u</kbd> unmarks a file, as in Dired.  <kbd>C</kbd> copies a file from the
archive to disk and <kbd>R</kbd> renames a file within the archive. 
<kbd>g</kbd> reverts the buffer from the archive on disk.  The keys
<kbd>M</kbd>, <kbd>G</kbd>, and <kbd>O</kbd> change the file's permission bits,
group, and owner, respectively.

   <p>Saving the Tar buffer writes a new version of the archive to disk with
the changes you made to the components.

   <p>You don't need the <code>tar</code> program to use Tar mode&mdash;Emacs reads
the archives directly.  However, accessing compressed archives
requires the appropriate uncompression program.

   <p><a name="index-Archive-mode-1333"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-archive-1334"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007barc_007d-1335"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bjar_007d-1336"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007brar_007d-1337"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bzip_007d-1338"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007blzh_007d-1339"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bzoo_007d-1340"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b7z_007d-1341"></a><a name="index-arc-1342"></a><a name="index-jar-1343"></a><a name="index-zip-1344"></a><a name="index-rar-1345"></a><a name="index-lzh-1346"></a><a name="index-zoo-1347"></a><a name="index-g_t7z-1348"></a><a name="index-Java-class-archives-1349"></a><a name="index-unzip-archives-1350"></a>  A separate but similar Archive mode is used for <code>arc</code>,
<code>jar</code>, <code>lzh</code>, <code>zip</code>, <code>rar</code>, <code>7z</code>, and
<code>zoo</code> archives, as well as <code>exe</code> files that are
self-extracting executables.

   <p>The key bindings of Archive mode are similar to those in Tar mode,
with the addition of the <kbd>m</kbd> key which marks a file for subsequent
operations, and <kbd>M-&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd> which unmarks all the marked files. 
Also, the <kbd>a</kbd> key toggles the display of detailed file
information, for those archive types where it won't fit in a single
line.  Operations such as renaming a subfile, or changing its mode or
owner, are supported only for some of the archive formats.

   <p>Unlike Tar mode, Archive mode runs the archiving programs to unpack
and repack archives.  However, you don't need these programs to look
at the archive table of contents, only to extract or manipulate the
subfiles in the archive.  Details of the program names and their
options can be set in the `<samp><span class="samp">Archive</span></samp>' Customize group
(see <a href="#Customization-Groups">Customization Groups</a>).

<h3 class="section">18.14 Remote Files</h3>

<p><a name="index-Tramp-1351"></a><a name="index-FTP-1352"></a><a name="index-remote-file-access-1353"></a>  You can refer to files on other machines using a special file name
syntax:

<pre class="example">     /<var>host</var>:<var>filename</var>
     /<var>user</var>@<var>host</var>:<var>filename</var>
     /<var>user</var>@<var>host</var>#<var>port</var>:<var>filename</var>
     /<var>method</var>:<var>user</var>@<var>host</var>:<var>filename</var>
     /<var>method</var>:<var>user</var>@<var>host</var>#<var>port</var>:<var>filename</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">To carry out this request, Emacs uses a remote-login program such as
<samp><span class="command">ftp</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">rlogin</span></samp>, or <samp><span class="command">telnet</span></samp>. 
You can always specify in the file name which method to use&mdash;for
example, <samp><span class="file">/ftp:</span><var>user</var><span class="file">@</span><var>host</var><span class="file">:</span><var>filename</var></samp> uses FTP,
whereas <samp><span class="file">/ssh:</span><var>user</var><span class="file">@</span><var>host</var><span class="file">:</span><var>filename</var></samp> uses
<samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp>.  When you don't specify a method in the file name,
Emacs chooses the method as follows:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>If the host name starts with `<samp><span class="samp">ftp.</span></samp>' (with dot), Emacs uses FTP. 
<li>If the user name is `<samp><span class="samp">ftp</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">anonymous</span></samp>', Emacs uses FTP. 
<li>If the variable <code>tramp-default-method</code> is set to `<samp><span class="samp">ftp</span></samp>',
Emacs uses FTP. 
<li>If <samp><span class="command">ssh-agent</span></samp> is running, Emacs uses <samp><span class="command">scp</span></samp>. 
<li>Otherwise, Emacs uses <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp>.
        </ol>

   <p><a name="index-disabling-remote-files-1354"></a>You can entirely turn off the remote file name feature by setting the
variable <code>tramp-mode</code> to <code>nil</code>.  You can turn off the
feature in individual cases by quoting the file name with `<samp><span class="samp">/:</span></samp>'
(see <a href="#Quoted-File-Names">Quoted File Names</a>).

   <p><a name="index-ange_002dftp-1355"></a>  Remote file access through FTP is handled by the Ange-FTP package, which
is documented in the following.  Remote file access through the other
methods is handled by the Tramp package, which has its own manual. 
See <a href="tramp.html#Top">The Tramp Manual</a>.

   <p><a name="index-ange_002dftp_002ddefault_002duser-1356"></a><a name="index-user-name-for-remote-file-access-1357"></a>  When the Ange-FTP package is used, Emacs logs in through FTP using
the name <var>user</var>, if that is specified in the remote file name.  If
<var>user</var> is unspecified, Emacs logs in using your user name on the
local system; but if you set the variable <code>ange-ftp-default-user</code>
to a string, that string is used instead.  When logging in, Emacs may
also ask for a password.

   <p><a name="index-backups-for-remote-files-1358"></a><a name="index-ange_002dftp_002dmake_002dbackup_002dfiles-1359"></a>  For performance reasons, Emacs does not make backup files for files
accessed via FTP by default.  To make it do so, change the variable
<code>ange-ftp-make-backup-files</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> value.

   <p>By default, auto-save files for remote files are made in the
temporary file directory on the local machine, as specified by the
variable <code>auto-save-file-name-transforms</code>.  See <a href="#Auto-Save-Files">Auto Save Files</a>.

   <p><a name="index-anonymous-FTP-1360"></a><a name="index-ange_002dftp_002dgenerate_002danonymous_002dpassword-1361"></a>  To visit files accessible by anonymous FTP, you use special user
names `<samp><span class="samp">anonymous</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">ftp</span></samp>'.  Passwords for these user names
are handled specially.  The variable
<code>ange-ftp-generate-anonymous-password</code> controls what happens: if
the value of this variable is a string, then that string is used as
the password; if non-<code>nil</code> (the default), then the value of
<code>user-mail-address</code> is used; if <code>nil</code>, then Emacs prompts
you for a password as usual (see <a href="#Passwords">Passwords</a>).

   <p><a name="index-firewall_002c-and-accessing-remote-files-1362"></a><a name="index-gateway_002c-and-remote-file-access-with-_0040code_007bange_002dftp_007d-1363"></a><a name="index-ange_002dftp_002dsmart_002dgateway-1364"></a><a name="index-ange_002dftp_002dgateway_002dhost-1365"></a>  Sometimes you may be unable to access files on a remote machine
because a <dfn>firewall</dfn> in between blocks the connection for security
reasons.  If you can log in on a <dfn>gateway</dfn> machine from which the
target files <em>are</em> accessible, and whose FTP server supports
gatewaying features, you can still use remote file names; all you have
to do is specify the name of the gateway machine by setting the
variable <code>ange-ftp-gateway-host</code>, and set
<code>ange-ftp-smart-gateway</code> to <code>t</code>.  Otherwise you may be able
to make remote file names work, but the procedure is complex.  You can
read the instructions by typing <kbd>M-x finder-commentary &lt;RET&gt;
ange-ftp &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.

<h3 class="section">18.15 Quoted File Names</h3>

<p><a name="index-quoting-file-names-1366"></a><a name="index-file-names_002c-quote-special-characters-1367"></a>  You can <dfn>quote</dfn> an absolute file name to prevent special
characters and syntax in it from having their special effects. 
The way to do this is to add `<samp><span class="samp">/:</span></samp>' at the beginning.

   <p>For example, you can quote a local file name which appears remote, to
prevent it from being treated as a remote file name.  Thus, if you have
a directory named <samp><span class="file">/foo:</span></samp> and a file named <samp><span class="file">bar</span></samp> in it, you
can refer to that file in Emacs as `<samp><span class="samp">/:/foo:/bar</span></samp>'.

   <p>`<samp><span class="samp">/:</span></samp>' can also prevent `<samp><span class="samp">~</span></samp>' from being treated as a special
character for a user's home directory.  For example, <samp><span class="file">/:/tmp/~hack</span></samp>
refers to a file whose name is <samp><span class="file">~hack</span></samp> in directory <samp><span class="file">/tmp</span></samp>.

   <p>Quoting with `<samp><span class="samp">/:</span></samp>' is also a way to enter in the minibuffer a
file name that contains `<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>'.  In order for this to work, the
`<samp><span class="samp">/:</span></samp>' must be at the beginning of the minibuffer contents.  (You
can also double each `<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>'; see <a href="#File-Names-with-_0024">File Names with $</a>.)

   <p>You can also quote wildcard characters with `<samp><span class="samp">/:</span></samp>', for visiting. 
For example, <samp><span class="file">/:/tmp/foo*bar</span></samp> visits the file
<samp><span class="file">/tmp/foo*bar</span></samp>.

   <p>Another method of getting the same result is to enter
<samp><span class="file">/tmp/foo[*]bar</span></samp>, which is a wildcard specification that matches
only <samp><span class="file">/tmp/foo*bar</span></samp>.  However, in many cases there is no need to
quote the wildcard characters because even unquoted they give the
right result.  For example, if the only file name in <samp><span class="file">/tmp</span></samp> that
starts with `<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>' and ends with `<samp><span class="samp">bar</span></samp>' is <samp><span class="file">foo*bar</span></samp>,
then specifying <samp><span class="file">/tmp/foo*bar</span></samp> will visit only
<samp><span class="file">/tmp/foo*bar</span></samp>.

<h3 class="section">18.16 File Name Cache</h3>

<p><a name="index-file-name-caching-1368"></a><a name="index-cache-of-file-names-1369"></a><a name="index-find-1370"></a><a name="index-C_002dTAB-1371"></a><a name="index-file_002dcache_002dminibuffer_002dcomplete-1372"></a>  You can use the <dfn>file name cache</dfn> to make it easy to locate a
file by name, without having to remember exactly where it is located. 
When typing a file name in the minibuffer, <kbd>C-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>
(<code>file-cache-minibuffer-complete</code>) completes it using the file
name cache.  If you repeat <kbd>C-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>, that cycles through the
possible completions of what you had originally typed.  (However, note
that the <kbd>C-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> character cannot be typed on most text
terminals.)

   <p>The file name cache does not fill up automatically.  Instead, you
load file names into the cache using these commands:

   <p><a name="index-file_002dcache_002dadd_002ddirectory-1373"></a>
     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-x file-cache-add-directory &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>directory</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Add each file name in <var>directory</var> to the file name cache.

subdirectories to the file name cache. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x file-cache-add-directory-using-locate &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>directory</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Add each file name in <var>directory</var> and all of its nested
subdirectories to the file name cache, using <samp><span class="command">locate</span></samp> to find

<h3 class="section">18.17 Convenience Features for Finding Files</h3>

<p>In this section, we introduce some convenient facilities for finding
recently-opened files, reading file names from a buffer, and viewing
image files.

   <p><a name="index-recentf_002dmode-1374"></a><a name="index-recentf_002dmode-1375"></a><a name="index-recentf_002dsave_002dlist-1376"></a><a name="index-recentf_002dedit_002dlist-1377"></a>  If you enable Recentf mode, with <kbd>M-x recentf-mode</kbd>, the
`<samp><span class="samp">File</span></samp>' menu includes a submenu containing a list of recently
opened files.  <kbd>M-x recentf-save-list</kbd> saves the current
<code>recent-file-list</code> to a file, and <kbd>M-x recentf-edit-list</kbd>
edits it.

<!-- FIXME partial-completion-mode (complete.el) is obsolete. -->
<p>The <kbd>M-x ffap</kbd> command generalizes <code>find-file</code> with more
powerful heuristic defaults (see <a href="#FFAP">FFAP</a>), often based on the text at
point.  Partial Completion mode offers other features extending
<code>find-file</code>, which can be used with <code>ffap</code>. 
See <a href="#Completion-Options">Completion Options</a>.

   <p><a name="index-image_002dmode-1378"></a><a name="index-image_002dtoggle_002ddisplay-1379"></a><a name="index-image_002dnext_002dfile-1380"></a><a name="index-image_002dprevious_002dfile-1381"></a><a name="index-images_002c-viewing-1382"></a>  Visiting image files automatically selects Image mode.  In this
major mode, you can type <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> (<code>image-toggle-display</code>)
to toggle between displaying the file as an image in the Emacs buffer,
and displaying its underlying text (or raw byte) representation. 
Displaying the file as an image works only if Emacs is compiled with
support for displaying such images.  If the displayed image is wider
or taller than the frame, the usual point motion keys (<kbd>C-f</kbd>,
<kbd>C-p</kbd>, and so forth) cause different parts of the image to be
displayed.  You can press <kbd>n</kbd> (<code>image-next-file</code>) and <kbd>p</kbd>
(<code>image-previous-file</code>) to visit the next image file and the
previous image file in the same directory, respectively.

   <p><a name="index-image_002dtoggle_002danimation-1383"></a><a name="index-image_002dnext_002dframe-1384"></a><a name="index-image_002dprevious_002dframe-1385"></a><a name="index-image_002dgoto_002dframe-1386"></a><a name="index-image_002dincrease_002dspeed-1387"></a><a name="index-image_002ddecrease_002dspeed-1388"></a><a name="index-image_002dreset_002dspeed-1389"></a><a name="index-image_002dreverse_002dspeed-1390"></a><a name="index-image_002danimate_002dloop-1391"></a><a name="index-image-animation-1392"></a><a name="index-animated-images-1393"></a>  If the image can be animated, the command &lt;RET&gt;
(<code>image-toggle-animation</code>) starts or stops the animation. 
Animation plays once, unless the option <code>image-animate-loop</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>.  With <kbd>f</kbd> (<code>image-next-frame</code>) and <kbd>b</kbd>
(<code>image-previous-frame</code>) you can step through the individual
frames.  Both commands accept a numeric prefix to step through several
frames at once.  You can go to a specific frame with <kbd>F</kbd>
(<code>image-goto-frame</code>).  Frames are indexed from 1.  Typing <kbd>a
+</kbd> (<code>image-increase-speed</code>) increases the speed of the animation,
<kbd>a -</kbd> (<code>image-decrease-speed</code>) decreases it, and <kbd>a r</kbd>
(<code>image-reverse-speed</code>) reverses it.  The command <kbd>a 0</kbd>
(<code>image-reset-speed</code>) resets the speed to the original value.

   <p><a name="index-ImageMagick-support-1394"></a><a name="index-imagemagick_002denabled_002dtypes-1395"></a><a name="index-imagemagick_002dtypes_002dinhibit-1396"></a>  If Emacs was compiled with support for the ImageMagick library, it
can use ImageMagick to render a wide variety of images.  The variable
<code>imagemagick-enabled-types</code> lists the image types that Emacs may
render using ImageMagick; each element in the list should be an
internal ImageMagick name for an image type, as a symbol or an
equivalent string (e.g., <code>BMP</code> for <samp><span class="file">.bmp</span></samp> images).  To
enable ImageMagick for all possible image types, change
<code>imagemagick-enabled-types</code> to <code>t</code>.  The variable
<code>imagemagick-types-inhibit</code> lists the image types which should
never be rendered using ImageMagick, regardless of the value of
<code>imagemagick-enabled-types</code> (the default list includes types like
<code>C</code> and <code>HTML</code>, which ImageMagick can render as an image
but Emacs should not).  To disable ImageMagick entirely, change
<code>imagemagick-types-inhibit</code> to <code>t</code>.

   <p><a name="index-thumbs_002dmode-1397"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-thumbs-1398"></a>  The Image-Dired package can also be used to view images as
thumbnails.  See <a href="#Image_002dDired">Image-Dired</a>.

<p><a name="index-filesets-1399"></a><a name="index-sets-of-files-1400"></a>
<a name="index-filesets_002dinit-1401"></a>  If you regularly edit a certain group of files, you can define them
as a <dfn>fileset</dfn>.  This lets you perform certain operations, such as
visiting, <code>query-replace</code>, and shell commands on all the files at
once.  To make use of filesets, you must first add the expression
<code>(filesets-init)</code> to your init file (see <a href="#Init-File">Init File</a>).  This
adds a `<samp><span class="samp">Filesets</span></samp>' menu to the menu bar.

   <p><a name="index-filesets_002dadd_002dbuffer-1402"></a><a name="index-filesets_002dremove_002dbuffer-1403"></a>  The simplest way to define a fileset is by adding files to it one at
a time.  To add a file to fileset <var>name</var>, visit the file and type
<kbd>M-x filesets-add-buffer &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>name</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.  If
there is no fileset <var>name</var>, this creates a new one, which
initially contains only the current file.  The command <kbd>M-x
filesets-remove-buffer</kbd> removes the current file from a fileset.

   <p>You can also edit the list of filesets directly, with <kbd>M-x
filesets-edit</kbd> (or by choosing `<samp><span class="samp">Edit Filesets</span></samp>' from the
`<samp><span class="samp">Filesets</span></samp>' menu).  The editing is performed in a Customize buffer
(see <a href="#Easy-Customization">Easy Customization</a>).  Normally, a fileset is a simple list of
files, but you can also define a fileset as a regular expression
matching file names.  Some examples of these more complicated filesets
are shown in the Customize buffer.  Remember to select `<samp><span class="samp">Save for
future sessions</span></samp>' if you want to use the same filesets in future Emacs
sessions.

   <p>You can use the command <kbd>M-x filesets-open</kbd> to visit all the
files in a fileset, and <kbd>M-x filesets-close</kbd> to close them.  Use
<kbd>M-x filesets-run-cmd</kbd> to run a shell command on all the files in
a fileset.  These commands are also available from the `<samp><span class="samp">Filesets</span></samp>'
menu, where each existing fileset is represented by a submenu.

   <p>See <a href="#Version-Control">Version Control</a>, for a different concept of filesets:
groups of files bundled together for version control operations. 
Filesets of that type are unnamed, and do not persist across Emacs
sessions.

<h2 class="chapter">19 Using Multiple Buffers</h2>

<p><a name="index-buffers-1404"></a>  The text you are editing in Emacs resides in an object called a
<dfn>buffer</dfn>.  Each time you visit a file, a buffer is used to hold
the file's text.  Each time you invoke Dired, a buffer is used to hold
the directory listing.  If you send a message with <kbd>C-x m</kbd>, a
buffer is used to hold the text of the message.  When you ask for a
command's documentation, that appears in a buffer named <samp><span class="file">*Help*</span></samp>.

   <p>Each buffer has a unique name, which can be of any length.  When a
buffer is displayed in a window, its name is shown in the mode line
(see <a href="#Mode-Line">Mode Line</a>).  The distinction between upper and lower case
matters in buffer names.  Most buffers are made by visiting files, and
their names are derived from the files' names; however, you can also
create an empty buffer with any name you want.  A newly started Emacs
has several buffers, including one named <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp>, which can
be used for evaluating Lisp expressions and is not associated with any
file (see <a href="#Lisp-Interaction">Lisp Interaction</a>).

   <p><a name="index-selected-buffer-1405"></a><a name="index-current-buffer-1406"></a>  At any time, one and only one buffer is <dfn>selected</dfn>; we call it
the <dfn>current buffer</dfn>.  We sometimes say that a command operates on
&ldquo;the buffer&rdquo;; this really means that it operates on the current
buffer.  When there is only one Emacs window, the buffer displayed in
that window is current.  When there are multiple windows, the buffer
displayed in the <dfn>selected window</dfn> is current.  See <a href="#Windows">Windows</a>.

   <p>Aside from its textual contents, each buffer records several pieces
of information, such as what file it is visiting (if any), whether it
is modified, and what major mode and minor modes are in effect
(see <a href="#Modes">Modes</a>).  These are stored in <dfn>buffer-local
variables</dfn>&mdash;variables that can have a different value in each buffer. 
See <a href="#Locals">Locals</a>.

   <p><a name="index-buffer-size_002c-maximum-1407"></a>  A buffer's size cannot be larger than some maximum, which is defined
by the largest buffer position representable by <dfn>Emacs integers</dfn>. 
This is because Emacs tracks buffer positions using that data type. 
For typical 64-bit machines, this maximum buffer size is 2^61 - 2
bytes, or about 2 EiB.  For typical 32-bit machines, the maximum is
usually 2^29 - 2 bytes, or about 512 MiB.  Buffer sizes are
also limited by the amount of memory in the system.

</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-b-1410"></a><a name="index-switch_002dto_002dbuffer-1411"></a>  The <kbd>C-x b</kbd> (<code>switch-to-buffer</code>) command reads a buffer
name using the minibuffer.  Then it makes that buffer current, and
displays it in the currently-selected window.  An empty input
specifies the buffer that was current most recently among those not
now displayed in any window.

   <p>While entering the buffer name, you can use the usual completion and
history commands (see <a href="#Minibuffer">Minibuffer</a>).  Note that <kbd>C-x b</kbd>, and
related commands, use <dfn>permissive completion with confirmation</dfn> for
minibuffer completion: if you type &lt;RET&gt; immediately after
completing up to a nonexistent buffer name, Emacs prints
`<samp><span class="samp">[Confirm]</span></samp>' and you must type a second &lt;RET&gt; to submit that
buffer name.  See <a href="#Completion-Exit">Completion Exit</a>, for details.

   <p>If you specify a buffer that does not exist, <kbd>C-x b</kbd> creates a
new, empty buffer that is not visiting any file, and selects it for
editing.  The default value of the variable <code>major-mode</code>
determines the new buffer's major mode; the default value is
Fundamental mode.  See <a href="#Major-Modes">Major Modes</a>.  One reason to create a new
buffer is to use it for making temporary notes.  If you try to save
it, Emacs asks for the file name to use, and the buffer's major mode
is re-established taking that file name into account (see <a href="#Choosing-Modes">Choosing Modes</a>).

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-_0040key_007bLEFT_007d-1412"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-_0040key_007bRIGHT_007d-1413"></a><a name="index-next_002dbuffer-1414"></a><a name="index-previous_002dbuffer-1415"></a>  For conveniently switching between a few buffers, use the commands
<kbd>C-x &lt;LEFT&gt;</kbd> and <kbd>C-x &lt;RIGHT&gt;</kbd>.  <kbd>C-x &lt;LEFT&gt;</kbd>
(<code>previous-buffer</code>) selects the previous buffer (following the
order of most recent selection in the current frame), while <kbd>C-x
&lt;RIGHT&gt;</kbd> (<code>next-buffer</code>) moves through buffers in the reverse
direction.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-4-b-1416"></a><a name="index-switch_002dto_002dbuffer_002dother_002dwindow-1417"></a>  To select a buffer in a window other than the current one, type
<kbd>C-x 4 b</kbd> (<code>switch-to-buffer-other-window</code>).  This prompts
for a buffer name using the minibuffer, displays that buffer in
another window, and selects that window.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-5-b-1418"></a><a name="index-switch_002dto_002dbuffer_002dother_002dframe-1419"></a>  Similarly, <kbd>C-x 5 b</kbd> (<code>switch-to-buffer-other-frame</code>)
prompts for a buffer name, displays that buffer in another frame, and
selects that frame.  If the buffer is already being shown in a window
on another frame, Emacs selects that window and frame instead of
creating a new frame.

   <p>See <a href="#Displaying-Buffers">Displaying Buffers</a>, for how the <kbd>C-x 4 b</kbd> and <kbd>C-x 5
b</kbd> commands get the window and/or frame to display in.

   <p>In addition, <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>, and any other command for visiting a
file, can also be used to switch to an existing file-visiting buffer. 
See <a href="#Visiting">Visiting</a>.

   <p><a name="index-goto_002dline-1420"></a>  <kbd>C-u M-g M-g</kbd>, that is <code>goto-line</code> with a plain prefix
argument, reads a number <var>n</var> using the minibuffer, selects the
most recently selected buffer other than the current buffer in another
window, and then moves point to the beginning of line number <var>n</var>
in that buffer.  This is mainly useful in a buffer that refers to line
numbers in another buffer: if point is on or just after a number,
<code>goto-line</code> uses that number as the default for <var>n</var>.  Note
that prefix arguments other than just <kbd>C-u</kbd> behave differently. 
<kbd>C-u 4 M-g M-g</kbd> goes to line 4 in the <em>current</em> buffer,
without reading a number from the minibuffer.  (Remember that <kbd>M-g
M-g</kbd> without prefix argument reads a number <var>n</var> and then moves to
line number <var>n</var> in the current buffer.  See <a href="#Moving-Point">Moving Point</a>.)

   <p>Emacs uses buffer names that start with a space for internal purposes. 
It treats these buffers specially in minor ways&mdash;for example, by
default they do not record undo information.  It is best to avoid using
such buffer names yourself.

The buffers are listed in the order that they were current; the

   <p>`<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>' in the first field of a line indicates that the buffer is
current.  `<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>' indicates a read-only buffer.  `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' indicates
that the buffer is modified.  If several buffers are modified, it
may be time to save some with <kbd>C-x s</kbd> (see <a href="#Save-Commands">Save Commands</a>).

its contents are not allowed.  The mode line indicates read-only
buffers with `<samp><span class="samp">%%</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">%*</span></samp>' near the left margin.  See <a href="#Mode-Line">Mode Line</a>.  Read-only buffers are usually made by subsystems such as Dired
and Rmail that have special commands to operate on the text; also by
visiting a file whose access control says you cannot write it.

   <p><a name="index-read_002donly_002dmode-1427"></a><a name="index-view_002dread_002donly-1428"></a> The command <kbd>C-x C-q</kbd> (<code>read-only-mode</code>) makes a read-only
buffer writable, and makes a writable buffer read-only.  This works by
setting the variable <code>buffer-read-only</code>, which has a local value
in each buffer and makes the buffer read-only if its value is
non-<code>nil</code>.  If you change the option <code>view-read-only</code> to a
non-<code>nil</code> value, making the buffer read-only with <kbd>C-x C-q</kbd>
also enables View mode in the buffer (see <a href="#View-Mode">View Mode</a>).

   <p><a name="index-rename_002dbuffer-1429"></a>  <kbd>M-x rename-buffer</kbd> changes the name of the current buffer.  You
specify the new name as a minibuffer argument; there is no default. 
If you specify a name that is in use for some other buffer, an error
happens and no renaming is done.

   <p><a name="index-rename_002duniquely-1430"></a>  <kbd>M-x rename-uniquely</kbd> renames the current buffer to a similar
name with a numeric suffix added to make it both different and unique. 
This command does not need an argument.  It is useful for creating
multiple shell buffers: if you rename the <samp><span class="file">*shell*</span></samp> buffer, then
do <kbd>M-x shell</kbd> again, it makes a new shell buffer named
<samp><span class="file">*shell*</span></samp>; meanwhile, the old shell buffer continues to exist
under its new name.  This method is also good for mail buffers,
compilation buffers, and most Emacs features that create special
buffers with particular names.  (With some of these features, such as
<kbd>M-x compile</kbd>, <kbd>M-x grep</kbd>, you need to switch to some other
buffer before using the command again, otherwise it will reuse the
current buffer despite the name change.)

   <p>The commands <kbd>M-x append-to-buffer</kbd> and <kbd>M-x insert-buffer</kbd>
can also be used to copy text from one buffer to another.

<h3 class="section">19.4 Killing Buffers</h3>

<p><a name="index-killing-buffers-1431"></a><a name="index-close-buffer-1432"></a><a name="index-close-file-1433"></a>  If you continue an Emacs session for a while, you may accumulate a
large number of buffers.  You may then find it convenient to <dfn>kill</dfn>
the buffers you no longer need.  (Some other editors call this
operation <dfn>close</dfn>, and talk about &ldquo;closing the buffer&rdquo; or
&ldquo;closing the file&rdquo; visited in the buffer.)  On most operating
systems, killing a buffer releases its space back to the operating
system so that other programs can use it.  Here are some commands for
killing buffers:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x k </kbd><var>bufname</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Kill buffer <var>bufname</var> (<code>kill-buffer</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x kill-some-buffers</kbd><dd>Offer to kill each buffer, one by one. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x kill-matching-buffers</kbd><dd>Offer to kill all buffers matching a regular expression. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-kill_002dbuffer-1434"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-k-1435"></a>  <kbd>C-x k</kbd> (<code>kill-buffer</code>) kills one buffer, whose name you
specify in the minibuffer.  The default, used if you type just
&lt;RET&gt; in the minibuffer, is to kill the current buffer.  If you
kill the current buffer, another buffer becomes current: one that was
current in the recent past but is not displayed in any window now.  If
you ask to kill a file-visiting buffer that is modified, then you must
confirm with <kbd>yes</kbd> before the buffer is killed.

   <p><a name="index-kill_002dsome_002dbuffers-1436"></a>  The command <kbd>M-x kill-some-buffers</kbd> asks about each buffer, one
by one.  An answer of <kbd>y</kbd> means to kill the buffer, just like
<code>kill-buffer</code>.  This command ignores buffers whose names begin
with a space, which are used internally by Emacs.

   <p><a name="index-kill_002dmatching_002dbuffers-1437"></a>  The command <kbd>M-x kill-matching-buffers</kbd> prompts for a regular
expression and kills all buffers whose names match that expression. 
See <a href="#Regexps">Regexps</a>.  Like <code>kill-some-buffers</code>, it asks for
confirmation before each kill.  This command normally ignores buffers
whose names begin with a space, which are used internally by Emacs. 
To kill internal buffers as well, call <code>kill-matching-buffers</code>
with a prefix argument.

   <p>The Buffer Menu feature is also convenient for killing various
buffers.  See <a href="#Several-Buffers">Several Buffers</a>.

   <p><a name="index-kill_002dbuffer_002dhook-1438"></a>  If you want to do something special every time a buffer is killed, you
can add hook functions to the hook <code>kill-buffer-hook</code> (see <a href="#Hooks">Hooks</a>).

   <p><a name="index-clean_002dbuffer_002dlist-1439"></a>  If you run one Emacs session for a period of days, as many people do,
it can fill up with buffers that you used several days ago.  The command
<kbd>M-x clean-buffer-list</kbd> is a convenient way to purge them; it kills
all the unmodified buffers that you have not used for a long time.  An
ordinary buffer is killed if it has not been displayed for three days;
however, you can specify certain buffers that should never be killed
automatically, and others that should be killed if they have been unused
for a mere hour.

   <p><a name="index-Midnight-mode-1440"></a><a name="index-midnight_002dmode-1441"></a><a name="index-midnight_002dhook-1442"></a>  You can also have this buffer purging done for you, once a day,
by enabling Midnight mode.  Midnight mode operates each day
at midnight; at that time, it runs <code>clean-buffer-list</code>, or
whichever functions you have placed in the normal hook
<code>midnight-hook</code> (see <a href="#Hooks">Hooks</a>).  To enable Midnight mode, use
the Customization buffer to set the variable <code>midnight-mode</code> to
<code>t</code>.  See <a href="#Easy-Customization">Easy Customization</a>.

</dl>

   <p>The <dfn>Buffer Menu</dfn> opened by <kbd>C-x C-b</kbd> (see <a href="#List-Buffers">List Buffers</a>)
does not merely list buffers.  It also allows you to perform various
operations on buffers, through an interface similar to Dired
(see <a href="#Dired">Dired</a>).  You can save buffers, kill them (here called
<dfn>deleting</dfn> them, for consistency with Dired), or display them.

   <p><a name="index-buffer_002dmenu-1444"></a><a name="index-buffer_002dmenu_002dother_002dwindow-1445"></a>  To use the Buffer Menu, type <kbd>C-x C-b</kbd> and switch to the window
displaying the <samp><span class="file">*Buffer List*</span></samp> buffer.  You can also type
<kbd>M-x buffer-menu</kbd> to open the Buffer Menu in the selected window. 
Alternatively, the command <kbd>M-x buffer-menu-other-window</kbd> opens
the Buffer Menu in another window, and selects that window.

   <p>The Buffer Menu is a read-only buffer, and can be changed only
through the special commands described in this section.  The usual
cursor motion commands can be used in this buffer.  The following
commands apply to the buffer described on the current line:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>d</kbd><dd><a name="index-Buffer_002dmenu_002ddelete-1446"></a><a name="index-d-_0040r_007b_0028Buffer-Menu_0029_007d-1447"></a>Flag the buffer for deletion (killing), then move point to the next
line (<code>Buffer-menu-delete</code>).  The deletion flag is indicated by
the character `<samp><span class="samp">D</span></samp>' on the line, before the buffer name.  The
deletion occurs only when you type the <kbd>x</kbd> command (see below).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-d</kbd><dd><a name="index-Buffer_002dmenu_002ddelete_002dbackwards-1448"></a><a name="index-C_002dd-_0040r_007b_0028Buffer-Menu_0029_007d-1449"></a>Like <kbd>d</kbd>, but move point up instead of down

both saving and deletion for the same buffer.

(<code>Buffer-menu-toggle-files-only</code>).  This command toggles the
inclusion of such buffers in the buffer list. 
</dl>

   <p>Normally, the buffer <samp><span class="file">*Buffer List*</span></samp> is not updated
automatically when buffers are created and killed; its contents are
just text.  If you have created, deleted or renamed buffers, the way
to update <samp><span class="file">*Buffer List*</span></samp> to show what you have done is to type
<kbd>g</kbd> (<code>revert-buffer</code>).  You can make this happen regularly
every <code>auto-revert-interval</code> seconds if you enable Auto Revert
mode in this buffer, as long as it is not marked modified.  Global
Auto Revert mode applies to the <samp><span class="file">*Buffer List*</span></samp> buffer only if
<code>global-auto-revert-non-file-buffers</code> is non-<code>nil</code>. 
See <a href="#Autorevert">global-auto-revert-non-file-buffers</a>, for details.

<h3 class="section">19.6 Indirect Buffers</h3>

<p><a name="index-indirect-buffer-1487"></a><a name="index-base-buffer-1488"></a>
  An <dfn>indirect buffer</dfn> shares the text of some other buffer, which
is called the <dfn>base buffer</dfn> of the indirect buffer.  In some ways it
is a buffer analogue of a symbolic link between files.

     
<a name="index-make_002dindirect_002dbuffer-1489"></a>
<dl><dt><kbd>M-x make-indirect-buffer &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>base-buffer</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>indirect-name</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Create an indirect buffer named <var>indirect-name</var> with base buffer
<var>base-buffer</var>. 
<a name="index-clone_002dindirect_002dbuffer-1490"></a><br><dt><kbd>M-x clone-indirect-buffer &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Create an indirect buffer that is a twin copy of the current buffer. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x 4 c</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dx-4-c-1491"></a><a name="index-clone_002dindirect_002dbuffer_002dother_002dwindow-1492"></a>Create an indirect buffer that is a twin copy of the current buffer, and
select it in another window (<code>clone-indirect-buffer-other-window</code>). 
</dl>

   <p>The text of the indirect buffer is always identical to the text of its
base buffer; changes made by editing either one are visible immediately
in the other.  But in all other respects, the indirect buffer and its
base buffer are completely separate.  They can have different names,
different values of point, different narrowing, different markers,
different major modes, and different local variables.

   <p>An indirect buffer cannot visit a file, but its base buffer can.  If
you try to save the indirect buffer, that actually works by saving the
base buffer.  Killing the base buffer effectively kills the indirect
buffer, but killing an indirect buffer has no effect on its base buffer.

   <p>One way to use indirect buffers is to display multiple views of an
outline.  See <a href="#Outline-Views">Outline Views</a>.

   <p><a name="index-clone_002dindirect_002dbuffer_002dhook-1493"></a>  A quick and handy way to make an indirect buffer is with the command
<kbd>M-x clone-indirect-buffer</kbd>.  It creates and selects an indirect
buffer whose base buffer is the current buffer.  With a numeric
argument, it prompts for the name of the indirect buffer; otherwise it
uses the name of the current buffer, with a `<samp><span class="samp">&lt;</span><var>n</var><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>' suffix
added.  <kbd>C-x 4 c</kbd> (<code>clone-indirect-buffer-other-window</code>)
works like <kbd>M-x clone-indirect-buffer</kbd>, but it selects the new
buffer in another window.  These functions run the hook
<code>clone-indirect-buffer-hook</code> after creating the indirect buffer.

   <p>The more general way to make an indirect buffer is with the command
<kbd>M-x make-indirect-buffer</kbd>.  It creates an indirect buffer
named <var>indirect-name</var> from a buffer <var>base-buffer</var>, prompting for
both using the minibuffer.

<h4 class="subsection">19.7.1 Making Buffer Names Unique</h4>

<p><a name="index-unique-buffer-names-1494"></a><a name="index-directories-in-buffer-names-1495"></a>  When several buffers visit identically-named files, Emacs must give
the buffers distinct names.  The default method adds a suffix based on
the names of the directories that contain the files.  For example, if
you visit files <samp><span class="file">/foo/bar/mumble/name</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">/baz/quux/mumble/name</span></samp> at the same time, their buffers will be
named `<samp><span class="samp">name&lt;bar/mumble&gt;</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">name&lt;quux/mumble&gt;</span></samp>', respectively. 
Emacs adds as many directory parts as are needed to make a unique name.

   <p><a name="index-uniquify_002dbuffer_002dname_002dstyle-1496"></a>  You can choose from several different styles for constructing unique
buffer names, by customizing the option <code>uniquify-buffer-name-style</code>.

   <p>The <code>forward</code> naming method includes part of the file's
directory name at the beginning of the buffer name; using this method,
buffers visiting the files <samp><span class="file">/u/rms/tmp/Makefile</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">/usr/projects/zaphod/Makefile</span></samp> would be named
`<samp><span class="samp">tmp/Makefile</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">zaphod/Makefile</span></samp>'.

   <p>In contrast, the <code>post-forward</code> naming method would call the
buffers `<samp><span class="samp">Makefile|tmp</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">Makefile|zaphod</span></samp>'.  The default
method <code>post-forward-angle-brackets</code> is like <code>post-forward</code>,
except that it encloses the unique path in angle brackets.  The
<code>reverse</code> naming method would call them `<samp><span class="samp">Makefile\tmp</span></samp>' and
`<samp><span class="samp">Makefile\zaphod</span></samp>'.  The nontrivial difference between
<code>post-forward</code> and <code>reverse</code> occurs when just one directory
name is not enough to distinguish two files; then <code>reverse</code> puts
the directory names in reverse order, so that <samp><span class="file">/top/middle/file</span></samp>
becomes `<samp><span class="samp">file\middle\top</span></samp>', while <code>post-forward</code> puts them in
forward order after the file name, as in `<samp><span class="samp">file|top/middle</span></samp>'.  If
<code>uniquify-buffer-name-style</code> is set to <code>nil</code>, the buffer
names simply get `<samp><span class="samp">&lt;2&gt;</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">&lt;3&gt;</span></samp>', etc. appended.

   <p>Which rule to follow for putting the directory names in the buffer
name is not very important if you are going to <em>look</em> at the
buffer names before you type one.  But as an experienced user, if you
know the rule, you won't have to look.  And then you may find that one
rule or another is easier for you to remember and apply quickly.

<h4 class="subsection">19.7.2 Fast minibuffer selection</h4>

<p><a name="index-icomplete_002dmode-1497"></a><a name="index-Icomplete-mode-1498"></a>
  Icomplete global minor mode provides a convenient way to quickly select an
element among the possible completions in a minibuffer.  When enabled, typing
in the minibuffer continuously displays a list of possible completions that
match the string you have typed.

   <p>At any time, you can type <kbd>C-j</kbd> to select the first completion in
the list.  So the way to select a particular completion is to make it the
first in the list.  There are two ways to do this.  You can type more
of the completion name and thus narrow down the list, excluding unwanted
completions above the desired one.  Alternatively, you can use <kbd>C-.</kbd>
and <kbd>C-,</kbd> to rotate the list until the desired buffer is first.

<p><a name="index-windows-in-Emacs-1506"></a><a name="index-multiple-windows-in-Emacs-1507"></a>
  Emacs can split a frame into two or many windows.  Multiple windows
can display parts of different buffers, or different parts of one
buffer.  Multiple frames always imply multiple windows, because each
frame has its own set of windows.  Each window belongs to one and only
one frame.

<h3 class="section">20.1 Concepts of Emacs Windows</h3>

<p>Each Emacs window displays one Emacs buffer at any time.  A single
buffer may appear in more than one window; if it does, any changes in
its text are displayed in all the windows where it appears.  But these
windows can show different parts of the buffer, because each window
has its own value of point.

   <p><a name="index-selected-window-1508"></a>  At any time, one Emacs window is the <dfn>selected window</dfn>; the
buffer this window is displaying is the current buffer.  On graphical
displays, the point is indicated by a solid blinking cursor in the
selected window, and by a hollow box in non-selected windows.  On text
terminals, the cursor is drawn only in the selected window. 
See <a href="#Cursor-Display">Cursor Display</a>.

   <p>Commands to move point affect the value of point for the selected
Emacs window only.  They do not change the value of point in other
Emacs windows, even those showing the same buffer.  The same is true
for buffer-switching commands such as <kbd>C-x b</kbd>; they do not affect
other windows at all.  However, there are other commands such as
<kbd>C-x 4 b</kbd> that select a different window and switch buffers in it. 
Also, all commands that display information in a window, including
(for example) <kbd>C-h f</kbd> (<code>describe-function</code>) and <kbd>C-x C-b</kbd>
(<code>list-buffers</code>), work by switching buffers in a nonselected
window without affecting the selected window.

   <p>When multiple windows show the same buffer, they can have different
regions, because they can have different values of point.  However,
they all have the same value for the mark, because each buffer has
only one mark position.

   <p>Each window has its own mode line, which displays the buffer name,
modification status and major and minor modes of the buffer that is
displayed in the window.  The selected window's mode line appears in a
different color.  See <a href="#Mode-Line">Mode Line</a>, for details.

<br><dt><kbd>C-mouse-2</kbd><dd>In the mode line of a window, split that window. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-2-1509"></a><a name="index-split_002dwindow_002dbelow-1510"></a>  <kbd>C-x 2</kbd> (<code>split-window-below</code>) splits the selected window
into two windows, one above the other.  After splitting, the selected
window is the upper one, and the newly split-off window is below. 
Both windows have the same value of point as before, and display the
same portion of the buffer (or as close to it as possible).  If
necessary, the windows are scrolled to keep point on-screen.  By
default, the two windows each get half the height of the original
window.  A positive numeric argument specifies how many lines to give
to the top window; a negative numeric argument specifies how many
lines to give to the bottom window.

   <p><a name="index-split_002dwindow_002dkeep_002dpoint-1511"></a>  If you change the variable <code>split-window-keep-point</code> to
<code>nil</code>, <kbd>C-x 2</kbd> instead adjusts the portion of the buffer
displayed by the two windows, as well as the value of point in each
window, in order to keep the text on the screen as close as possible
to what it was before; furthermore, if point was in the lower half of
the original window, the bottom window is selected instead of the
upper one.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-3-1512"></a><a name="index-split_002dwindow_002dright-1513"></a>  <kbd>C-x 3</kbd> (<code>split-window-right</code>) splits the selected window
into two side-by-side windows.  The left window is the selected one;
the right window displays the same portion of the same buffer, and has
the same value of point.  A positive numeric argument specifies how
many columns to give the left window; a negative numeric argument
specifies how many columns to give the right window.

   <p><a name="index-truncate_002dpartial_002dwidth_002dwindows-1514"></a>  When you split a window with <kbd>C-x 3</kbd>, each resulting window
occupies less than the full width of the frame.  If it becomes too
narrow, the buffer may be difficult to read if continuation lines are
in use (see <a href="#Continuation-Lines">Continuation Lines</a>).  Therefore, Emacs automatically
switches to line truncation if the window width becomes narrower than
50 columns.  This truncation occurs regardless of the value of the
variable <code>truncate-lines</code> (see <a href="#Line-Truncation">Line Truncation</a>); it is
instead controlled by the variable
<code>truncate-partial-width-windows</code>.  If the value of this variable
is a positive integer (the default is 50), that specifies the minimum
total width for a partial-width window before automatic line
truncation occurs; if the value is <code>nil</code>, automatic line
truncation is disabled; and for any other non-<code>nil</code> value, Emacs
truncates lines in every partial-width window regardless of its width. 
The total width of a window is in column units as reported by
<code>window-total-width</code> (see <a href="elisp.html#Window-Sizes">Window Sizes</a>), it includes the fringes, the continuation and
truncation glyphs, the margins, and the scroll bar.

   <p>On text terminals, side-by-side windows are separated by a vertical
divider which is drawn using the <code>vertical-border</code> face.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dmouse_002d2-_0040r_007b_0028mode-line_0029_007d-1515"></a><a name="index-C_002dmouse_002d2-_0040r_007b_0028scroll-bar_0029_007d-1516"></a>  If you click <kbd>C-mouse-2</kbd> in the mode line of a window, that
splits the window, putting a vertical divider where you click. 
Depending on how Emacs is compiled, you can also split a window by
clicking <kbd>C-mouse-2</kbd> in the scroll bar, which puts a horizontal
divider where you click (this feature does not work when Emacs uses
GTK+ scroll bars).

   <p><a name="index-window_002dresize_002dpixelwise-1517"></a>  By default, when you split a window, Emacs gives each of the
resulting windows dimensions that are an integral multiple of the
default font size of the frame.  That might subdivide the screen
estate unevenly between the resulting windows.  If you set the
variable <code>window-resize-pixelwise</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> value,
Emacs will give each window the same number of pixels (give or take
one pixel if the initial dimension was an odd number of pixels).  Note
that when a frame's pixel size is not a multiple of the frame's
character size, at least one window may get resized pixelwise even if
this option is <code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-o-1518"></a><a name="index-other_002dwindow-1519"></a>With the keyboard, you can switch windows by typing <kbd>C-x o</kbd>
(<code>other-window</code>).  That is an <kbd>o</kbd>, for &ldquo;other&rdquo;, not a zero. 
When there are more than two windows, this command moves through all the
windows in a cyclic order, generally top to bottom and left to right. 
After the rightmost and bottommost window, it goes back to the one at
the upper left corner.  A numeric argument means to move several steps
in the cyclic order of windows.  A negative argument moves around the
cycle in the opposite order.  When the minibuffer is active, the
minibuffer is the last window in the cycle; you can switch from the
minibuffer window to one of the other windows, and later switch back and
finish supplying the minibuffer argument that is requested. 
See <a href="#Minibuffer-Edit">Minibuffer Edit</a>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dM_002dv-1520"></a><a name="index-scroll_002dother_002dwindow-1521"></a>  The usual scrolling commands (see <a href="#Display">Display</a>) apply to the selected
window only, but there is one command to scroll the next window. 
<kbd>C-M-v</kbd> (<code>scroll-other-window</code>) scrolls the window that
<kbd>C-x o</kbd> would select.  It takes arguments, positive and negative,
like <kbd>C-v</kbd>.  (In the minibuffer, <kbd>C-M-v</kbd> scrolls the help
window associated with the minibuffer, if any, rather than the next
window in the standard cyclic order; see <a href="#Minibuffer-Edit">Minibuffer Edit</a>.)

   <p><a name="index-mouse_002dautoselect_002dwindow-1522"></a>  If you set <code>mouse-autoselect-window</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> value,
moving the mouse over a different window selects that window.  This
feature is off by default.

(<code>delete-window</code>).  (That is a zero.)  Once a window is deleted,
the space that it occupied is given to an adjacent window (but not the
minibuffer window, even if that is active at the time).  Deleting the
window has no effect on the buffer it used to display; the buffer
continues to exist, and you can still switch to it with <kbd>C-x b</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-kill_002dbuffer_002dand_002dwindow-1535"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-4-0-1536"></a>  <kbd>C-x 4 0</kbd> (<code>kill-buffer-and-window</code>) is a stronger command

with a negative argument, it reduces the height by that many lines. 
If there are no vertically adjacent windows (i.e., the window is at the
full frame height), that signals an error.  The command also signals
an error if you attempt to reduce the height of any window below a
certain minimum number of lines, specified by the variable
<code>window-min-height</code> (the default is 4).

signal an error if you attempt to reduce the width of any window below
a certain minimum number of columns, specified by the variable

   <p>Mouse clicks on the mode line (see <a href="#Mode-Line-Mouse">Mode Line Mouse</a>) or on window

<h3 class="section">20.6 Displaying a Buffer in a Window</h3>

<p>It is a common Emacs operation to display or pop up some buffer
in response to a user command.  There are several different ways in
which commands do this.

   <p>Many commands, like <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> (<code>find-file</code>), display the
buffer by &ldquo;taking over&rdquo; the selected window, expecting that the
user's attention will be diverted to that buffer.  These commands
usually work by calling <code>switch-to-buffer</code> internally
(see <a href="#Select-Buffer">Select Buffer</a>).

   <p>Some commands try to display intelligently, trying not to take
over the selected window, e.g., by splitting off a new window and
displaying the desired buffer there.  Such commands, which include the
various help commands (see <a href="#Help">Help</a>), work by calling
<code>display-buffer</code> internally.  See <a href="#Window-Choice">Window Choice</a>, for details.

   <p>Other commands do the same as <code>display-buffer</code>, and
additionally select the displaying window so that you can begin
editing its buffer.  The command <kbd>C-x `</kbd> (<code>next-error</code>) is
one example (see <a href="#Compilation-Mode">Compilation Mode</a>).  Such commands work by calling
the function <code>pop-to-buffer</code> internally.  See <a href="elisp.html#Switching-Buffers">Switching to a Buffer in a Window</a>.

   <p>Commands with names ending in <code>-other-window</code> behave like
<code>display-buffer</code>, except that they never display in the selected
window.  Several of these commands are bound in the <kbd>C-x 4</kbd> prefix
key (see <a href="#Pop-Up-Window">Pop Up Window</a>).

   <p>Commands with names ending in <code>-other-frame</code> behave like
<code>display-buffer</code>, except that they (i) never display in the
selected window and (ii) prefer to create a new frame to display the
desired buffer instead of splitting a window&mdash;as though the variable
<code>pop-up-frames</code> is set to <code>t</code> (see <a href="#Window-Choice">Window Choice</a>). 
Several of these commands are bound in the <kbd>C-x 5</kbd> prefix key.

<p><a name="index-display_002dbuffer_002c-detailed-description-1552"></a>
The <code>display-buffer</code> command (as well as commands that call it
internally) chooses a window to display by following the steps given
below.  See <a href="elisp.html#Choosing-Window">Choosing a Window for Display</a>, for details about how to alter this
sequence of steps.

     
<a name="index-same_002dwindow_002dbuffer_002dnames-1553"></a>
<a name="index-same_002dwindow_002dregexps-1554"></a>
<ul><li>First, check if the buffer should be displayed in the selected window
regardless of other considerations.  You can tell Emacs to do this by
adding the desired buffer's name to the list
<code>same-window-buffer-names</code>, or adding a matching regular
expression to the list <code>same-window-regexps</code>.  By default, these
variables are <code>nil</code>, so this step is skipped.

     <li>Otherwise, if the buffer is already displayed in an existing window,
reuse that window.  Normally, only windows on the selected frame
are considered, but windows on other frames are also reusable if you
change <code>pop-up-frames</code> (see below) to <code>t</code>.

     <p><a name="index-pop_002dup_002dframes-1555"></a><li>Otherwise, optionally create a new frame and display the buffer there. 
By default, this step is skipped.  To enable it, change the variable
<code>pop-up-frames</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> value.  The special value
<code>graphic-only</code> means to do this only on graphical displays.

     <li>Otherwise, try to create a new window by splitting a window on the
selected frame, and display the buffer in that new window.

     <p><a name="index-split_002dheight_002dthreshold-1556"></a><a name="index-split_002dwidth_002dthreshold-1557"></a>The split can be either vertical or horizontal, depending on the
variables <code>split-height-threshold</code> and
<code>split-width-threshold</code>.  These variables should have integer
values.  If <code>split-height-threshold</code> is smaller than the chosen
window's height, the split puts the new window below.  Otherwise, if
<code>split-width-threshold</code> is smaller than the window's width, the
split puts the new window on the right.  If neither condition holds,
Emacs tries to split so that the new window is below&mdash;but only if the
window was not split before (to avoid excessive splitting).

     <li>Otherwise, display the buffer in a window previously showing it. 
Normally, only windows on the selected frame are considered, but if
<code>pop-up-frames</code> is non-<code>nil</code> the window may be also on another
frame.

     <li>Otherwise, display the buffer in an existing window on the selected
frame.

     <li>If all the above methods fail for whatever reason, create a new frame
and display the buffer there. 
</ul>

   <p>A more advanced and flexible way to customize the behavior of
<code>display-buffer</code> is by using the option <code>display-buffer-alist</code>
mentioned in the next section.

<h4 class="subsection">20.6.2 Displaying non-editable buffers.</h4>

<p><a name="index-pop_002dup-windows-1558"></a><a name="index-temporary-windows-1559"></a>
Some buffers are shown in windows for perusal rather than for editing. 
Help commands (see <a href="#Help">Help</a>) typically use a buffer called <samp><span class="file">*Help*</span></samp>
for that purpose, minibuffer completion (see <a href="#Completion">Completion</a>) uses a
buffer called <samp><span class="file">*Completions*</span></samp> instead.  Such buffers are usually
displayed only for a short period of time.

   <p>Normally, Emacs chooses the window for such temporary displays via
<code>display-buffer</code> as described above.  The <samp><span class="file">*Completions*</span></samp>
buffer, on the other hand, is normally displayed in a window at the
bottom of the selected frame, regardless of the number of windows
already shown on that frame.

   <p>If you prefer Emacs to display a temporary buffer in a different
fashion, we recommend to customize the variable
<code>display-buffer-alist</code> (see <a href="elisp.html#Choosing-Window">Choosing a Window for Display</a>).  For example,
to display <samp><span class="file">*Completions*</span></samp> by splitting a window as described in
the previous section, use the following form in your initialization
file (see <a href="#Init-File">Init File</a>):

<pre class="example">     (customize-set-variable
      'display-buffer-alist
      '(("\\*Completions\\*" display-buffer-pop-up-window)))
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-temp_002dbuffer_002dresize_002dmode-1560"></a>  The <samp><span class="file">*Completions*</span></samp> buffer is also special in the sense that
Emacs usually tries to make its window just as large as necessary to
display all of its contents.  To resize windows showing other
temporary displays like, for example, the <samp><span class="file">*Help*</span></samp> buffer
accordingly, turn on the minor mode (see <a href="#Minor-Modes">Minor Modes</a>)
<code>temp-buffer-resize-mode</code> (see <a href="elisp.html#Temporary-Displays">Temporary Displays</a>).

   <p><a name="index-temp_002dbuffer_002dmax_002dheight-1561"></a><a name="index-temp_002dbuffer_002dmax_002dwidth-1562"></a>  The maximum size of windows resized by <code>temp-buffer-resize-mode</code>
can be controlled by customizing the options
<code>temp-buffer-max-height</code> and <code>temp-buffer-max-width</code>
(see <a href="elisp.html#Temporary-Displays">Temporary Displays</a>) and cannot exceed the size of the containing frame.

window configuration (i.e., how the frames are partitioned into
windows), so that you can undo them.  You can toggle Winner mode
with <kbd>M-x winner-mode</kbd>, or by customizing the variable
<code>winner-mode</code>.  When the mode is enabled, <kbd>C-c left</kbd>
(<code>winner-undo</code>) undoes the last window configuration change.  If
you change your mind while undoing, you can redo the changes you had
undone using <kbd>C-c right</kbd> (<code>M-x winner-redo</code>).

   <p>Follow mode (<kbd>M-x follow-mode</kbd>) synchronizes several windows on
the same buffer so that they always display adjacent sections of that
buffer.  See <a href="#Follow-Mode">Follow Mode</a>.

between neighboring windows in a frame.  <kbd>M-x windmove-right</kbd>
selects the window immediately to the right of the currently selected
one, and similarly for the left, up, and down
counterparts.  <kbd>M-x windmove-default-keybindings</kbd> binds these
commands to <kbd>S-right</kbd> etc.; doing so disables shift selection for
those keys (see <a href="#Shift-Selection">Shift Selection</a>).

   <p>The command <kbd>M-x compare-windows</kbd> lets you compare the text

<h2 class="chapter">21 Frames and Graphical Displays</h2>

<p><a name="index-frames-1576"></a>
  When Emacs is started on a graphical display, e.g., on the X Window
System, it occupies a graphical system-level display region.  In this
manual, we call this a <dfn>frame</dfn>, reserving the word &ldquo;window&rdquo; for
the part of the frame used for displaying a buffer.  A frame initially
contains one window, but it can be subdivided into multiple windows
(see <a href="#Windows">Windows</a>).  A frame normally also contains a menu bar, tool
bar, and echo area.

   <p>You can also create additional frames (see <a href="#Creating-Frames">Creating Frames</a>). 
All frames created in the same Emacs session have access to the same
underlying buffers and other data.  For instance, if a buffer is being
shown in more than one frame, any changes made to it in one frame show
up immediately in the other frames too.

   <p>Typing <kbd>C-x C-c</kbd> closes all the frames on the current display,
and ends the Emacs session if it has no frames open on any other
displays (see <a href="#Exiting">Exiting</a>).  To close just the selected frame, type
<kbd>C-x 5 0</kbd> (that is zero, not <kbd>o</kbd>).

   <p>This chapter describes Emacs features specific to graphical displays
(particularly mouse commands), and features for managing multiple
frames.  On text terminals, many of these features are unavailable. 
However, it is still possible to create multiple frames on text
terminals; such frames are displayed one at a time, filling the entire
terminal screen (see <a href="#Non_002dWindow-Terminals">Non-Window Terminals</a>).  It is also possible
to use the mouse on some text terminals (see <a href="#Text_002dOnly-Mouse">Text-Only Mouse</a>, for
doing so on GNU and Unix systems; and
see <a href="#MS_002dDOS-Mouse">MS-DOS Mouse</a>,
for doing so on MS-DOS).  Menus are supported on all text terminals.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>mouse-1</kbd><dd>Move point to where you click (<code>mouse-set-point</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>Drag-mouse-1</kbd><dd>Activate the region around the text selected by dragging, and put the
text in the primary selection (<code>mouse-set-region</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>mouse-2</kbd><dd>Move point to where you click, and insert the contents of the primary
selection there (<code>mouse-yank-primary</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>mouse-3</kbd><dd>If the region is active, move the nearer end of the region to the
click position; otherwise, set mark at the current value of point and
point at the click position.  Save the resulting region in the kill
ring; on a second click, kill it (<code>mouse-save-then-kill</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-mouse_002dset_002dpoint-1582"></a>  The most basic mouse command is <code>mouse-set-point</code>, which is
invoked by clicking with the left mouse button, <kbd>mouse-1</kbd>, in the
text area of a window.  This moves point to the position where you
clicked.  If that window was not the selected window, it becomes the
selected window.

   <p><a name="index-x_002dmouse_002dclick_002dfocus_002dignore_002dposition-1583"></a>  Normally, if the frame you clicked in was not the selected frame, it
is made the selected frame, in addition to selecting the window and
setting the cursor.  On the X Window System, you can change this by
setting the variable <code>x-mouse-click-focus-ignore-position</code> to
<code>t</code>.  In that case, the initial click on an unselected frame just
selects the frame, without doing anything else; clicking again selects
the window and sets the cursor position.

   <p><a name="index-mouse_002c-dragging-1584"></a><a name="index-mouse_002dset_002dregion-1585"></a>  Holding down <kbd>mouse-1</kbd> and dragging the mouse over a stretch
of text activates the region around that text
(<code>mouse-set-region</code>), placing the mark where you started holding
down the mouse button, and point where you release it (see <a href="#Mark">Mark</a>). 
In addition, the text in the region becomes the primary selection
(see <a href="#Primary-Selection">Primary Selection</a>).

   <p><a name="index-mouse_002ddrag_002dcopy_002dregion-1586"></a>  If you change the variable <code>mouse-drag-copy-region</code> to a
non-<code>nil</code> value, dragging the mouse over a stretch of text also
adds the text to the kill ring.  The default is <code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-mouse_002dscroll_002dmin_002dlines-1587"></a>  If you move the mouse off the top or bottom of the window while
dragging, the window scrolls at a steady rate until you move the mouse
back into the window.  This way, you can select regions that don't fit
entirely on the screen.  The number of lines scrolled per step depends
on how far away from the window edge the mouse has gone; the variable
<code>mouse-scroll-min-lines</code> specifies a minimum step size.

   <p><a name="index-mouse_002dyank_002dprimary-1588"></a><a name="index-mouse_002dyank_002dat_002dclick-1589"></a>  Clicking with the middle mouse button, <kbd>mouse-2</kbd>, moves point to
the position where you clicked and inserts the contents of the primary
selection (<code>mouse-yank-primary</code>).  See <a href="#Primary-Selection">Primary Selection</a>. 
This behavior is consistent with other X applications.  Alternatively,
you can rebind <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> to <code>mouse-yank-at-click</code>, which
performs a yank at the position you click.

   <p><a name="index-mouse_002dyank_002dat_002dpoint-1590"></a>  If you change the variable <code>mouse-yank-at-point</code> to a
non-<code>nil</code> value, <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> does not move point; it inserts
the text at point, regardless of where you clicked or even which of
the frame's windows you clicked on.  This variable affects both
<code>mouse-yank-primary</code> and <code>mouse-yank-at-click</code>.

   <p><a name="index-mouse_002dsave_002dthen_002dkill-1591"></a>  Clicking with the right mouse button, <kbd>mouse-3</kbd>, runs the
command <code>mouse-save-then-kill</code>.  This performs several actions
depending on where you click and the status of the region:

     <ul>
<li>If no region is active, clicking <kbd>mouse-3</kbd> activates the region,
placing the mark where point was and point at the clicked position.

     <li>If a region is active, clicking <kbd>mouse-3</kbd> adjusts the nearer end
of the region by moving it to the clicked position.  The adjusted
region's text is copied to the kill ring; if the text in the original
region was already on the kill ring, it replaces it there.

     <li>If you originally specified the region using a double or triple
<kbd>mouse-1</kbd>, so that the region is defined to consist of entire
words or lines (see <a href="#Word-and-Line-Mouse">Word and Line Mouse</a>), then adjusting the
region with <kbd>mouse-3</kbd> also proceeds by entire words or lines.

     <li>If you use <kbd>mouse-3</kbd> a second time consecutively, at the same
place, that kills the region already selected.  Thus, the simplest way
to kill text with the mouse is to click <kbd>mouse-1</kbd> at one end, then
click <kbd>mouse-3</kbd> twice at the other end.  To copy the text into the
kill ring without deleting it from the buffer, press <kbd>mouse-3</kbd>
just once&mdash;or just drag across the text with <kbd>mouse-1</kbd>.  Then you
can copy it elsewhere by yanking it. 
</ul>

   <p>The <code>mouse-save-then-kill</code> command also obeys the variable
<code>mouse-drag-copy-region</code> (described above).  If the value is
non-<code>nil</code>, then whenever the command sets or adjusts the active
region, the text in the region is also added to the kill ring.  If the
latest kill ring entry had been added the same way, that entry is
replaced rather than making a new entry.

   <p>Whenever you set the region using any of the mouse commands
described above, the mark will be deactivated by any subsequent
unshifted cursor motion command, in addition to the usual ways of
deactivating the mark.  See <a href="#Shift-Selection">Shift Selection</a>.

   <p><a name="index-mouse-wheel-1592"></a><a name="index-mouse_002dwheel_002dmode-1593"></a><a name="index-Mouse-Wheel-minor-mode-1594"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Mouse-Wheel-1595"></a><a name="index-mouse_002dwheel_002dfollow_002dmouse-1596"></a><a name="index-mouse_002dwheel_002dscroll_002damount-1597"></a><a name="index-mouse_002dwheel_002dprogressive_002dspeed-1598"></a>  Some mice have a &ldquo;wheel&rdquo; which can be used for scrolling.  Emacs
supports scrolling windows with the mouse wheel, by default, on most
graphical displays.  To toggle this feature, use <kbd>M-x
mouse-wheel-mode</kbd>.  The variables <code>mouse-wheel-follow-mouse</code> and
<code>mouse-wheel-scroll-amount</code> determine where and by how much
buffers are scrolled.  The variable
<code>mouse-wheel-progressive-speed</code> determines whether the scroll
speed is linked to how fast you move the wheel.

<h3 class="section">21.3 Following References with the Mouse</h3>

<p><a name="index-mouse_002d1-_0040r_007b_0028on-buttons_0029_007d-1599"></a><a name="index-mouse_002d2-_0040r_007b_0028on-buttons_0029_007d-1600"></a><a name="index-hyperlinks-1601"></a><a name="index-links-1602"></a><a name="index-text-buttons-1603"></a><a name="index-buttons-1604"></a>
<a name="index-mouse_002dhighlight-1605"></a>  Some Emacs buffers include <dfn>buttons</dfn>, or <dfn>hyperlinks</dfn>:
pieces of text that perform some action (e.g., following a reference)
when activated (e.g., by clicking on them).  Usually, a button's text
is visually highlighted: it is underlined, or a box is drawn around
it.  If you move the mouse over a button, the shape of the mouse
cursor changes and the button lights up.  If you change the variable
<code>mouse-highlight</code> to <code>nil</code>, Emacs disables this
highlighting.

   <p>You can activate a button by moving point to it and typing
&lt;RET&gt;, or by clicking either <kbd>mouse-1</kbd> or <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> on the
button.  For example, in a Dired buffer, each file name is a button;
activating it causes Emacs to visit that file (see <a href="#Dired">Dired</a>).  In a
<samp><span class="file">*Compilation*</span></samp> buffer, each error message is a button, and
activating it visits the source code for that error
(see <a href="#Compilation">Compilation</a>).

   <p>Although clicking <kbd>mouse-1</kbd> on a button usually activates the
button, if you hold the mouse button down for a period of time before
releasing it (specifically, for more than 450 milliseconds), then
Emacs moves point where you clicked, without activating the button. 
In this way, you can use the mouse to move point over a button without
activating it.  Dragging the mouse over or onto a button has its usual
behavior of setting the region, and does not activate the button.

   <p>You can change how <kbd>mouse-1</kbd> applies to buttons by customizing
the variable <code>mouse-1-click-follows-link</code>.  If the value is a
positive integer, that determines how long you need to hold the mouse
button down for, in milliseconds, to cancel button activation; the
default is 450, as described in the previous paragraph.  If the value
is <code>nil</code>, <kbd>mouse-1</kbd> just sets point where you clicked, and
does not activate buttons.  If the value is <code>double</code>, double
clicks activate buttons but single clicks just set point.

   <p><a name="index-mouse_002d1_002dclick_002din_002dnon_002dselected_002dwindows-1606"></a>  Normally, <kbd>mouse-1</kbd> on a button activates the button even if it
is in a non-selected window.  If you change the variable
<code>mouse-1-click-in-non-selected-windows</code> to <code>nil</code>,
<kbd>mouse-1</kbd> on a button in an unselected window moves point to the
clicked position and selects that window, without activating the
button.

     <p>The MSB (&ldquo;mouse select buffer&rdquo;) global minor mode makes this

     <br><dt><kbd>C-mouse-3</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dmouse_002d3-1609"></a>This menu is mode-specific.  For most modes if Menu-bar mode is on,
this menu has the same items as all the mode-specific menu-bar menus
put together.  Some modes may specify a different menu for this
button.  If Menu Bar mode is off, this menu contains all the items
which would be present in the menu bar&mdash;not just the mode-specific
ones&mdash;so that you can access them without having to display the menu
bar.

     <br><dt><kbd>S-mouse-1</kbd><dd>This menu is for changing the default face within the window's buffer.

   <p>Some graphical applications use <kbd>mouse-3</kbd> for a mode-specific
menu.  If you prefer <kbd>mouse-3</kbd> in Emacs to bring up such a menu
instead of running the <code>mouse-save-then-kill</code> command, rebind
<kbd>mouse-3</kbd> by adding the following line to your init file
(see <a href="#Init-Rebinding">Init Rebinding</a>):

  You can use mouse clicks on window mode lines to select and manipulate
windows.

   <p>Some areas of the mode line, such as the buffer name, and major and minor
mode names, have their own special mouse bindings.  These areas are
highlighted when you hold the mouse over them, and information about
the special bindings will be displayed (see <a href="#Tooltips">Tooltips</a>).  This
section's commands do not apply in those areas.

dragging <kbd>mouse-1</kbd> on the mode line, you can move it, thus
changing the height of the windows above and below.  Changing heights
with the mouse in this way never deletes windows, it just refuses to
make any window smaller than the minimum height.

<h3 class="section">21.6 Creating Frames</h3>

<p><a name="index-creating-frames-1617"></a>
<a name="index-C_002dx-5-1618"></a>  The prefix key <kbd>C-x 5</kbd> is analogous to <kbd>C-x 4</kbd>.  Whereas
each <kbd>C-x 4</kbd> command pops up a buffer in a different window in the
selected frame (see <a href="#Pop-Up-Window">Pop Up Window</a>), the <kbd>C-x 5</kbd> commands use a
different frame.  If an existing visible or iconified (a.k.a. &ldquo;minimized&rdquo;)
frame already displays the requested buffer, that frame is raised and
deiconified (&ldquo;un-minimized&rdquo;); otherwise, a new frame is created on
the current display terminal.

   <p>The various <kbd>C-x 5</kbd> commands differ in how they find or create the
buffer to select:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x 5 2</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dx-5-2-1619"></a><a name="index-make_002dframe_002dcommand-1620"></a>Create a new frame (<code>make-frame-command</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x 5 b </kbd><var>bufname</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Select buffer <var>bufname</var> in another frame.  This runs
<code>switch-to-buffer-other-frame</code>. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x 5 f </kbd><var>filename</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Visit file <var>filename</var> and select its buffer in another frame.  This
runs <code>find-file-other-frame</code>.  See <a href="#Visiting">Visiting</a>. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x 5 d </kbd><var>directory</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Select a Dired buffer for directory <var>directory</var> in another frame. 
This runs <code>dired-other-frame</code>.  See <a href="#Dired">Dired</a>. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x 5 m</kbd><dd>Start composing a mail message in another frame.  This runs
<code>compose-mail-other-frame</code>.  It is the other-frame variant of
<kbd>C-x m</kbd>.  See <a href="#Sending-Mail">Sending Mail</a>. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x 5 .</kbd><dd>Find the definition of an identifier in another frame.  This runs
<code>xref-find-definitions-other-frame</code>, the multiple-frame variant
of <kbd>M-.</kbd>.  See <a href="#Xref">Xref</a>. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x 5 r </kbd><var>filename</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dx-5-r-1621"></a><a name="index-find_002dfile_002dread_002donly_002dother_002dframe-1622"></a>Visit file <var>filename</var> read-only, and select its buffer in another
frame.  This runs <code>find-file-read-only-other-frame</code>. 
See <a href="#Visiting">Visiting</a>. 
</dl>

   <p>You can control the appearance and behavior of the newly-created
frames by specifying <dfn>frame parameters</dfn>.  See <a href="#Frame-Parameters">Frame Parameters</a>.

<h3 class="section">21.7 Frame Commands</h3>

<p>The following commands are used to delete and operate on frames:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x 5 0</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dx-5-0-1623"></a><a name="index-delete_002dframe-1624"></a>Delete the selected frame (<code>delete-frame</code>).  This signals an
error if there is only one frame.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-z</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dz-_0040r_007b_0028X-windows_0029_007d-1625"></a><a name="index-suspend_002dframe-1626"></a>Minimize (or iconify) the selected Emacs frame
(<code>suspend-frame</code>).  See <a href="#Exiting">Exiting</a>.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-x 5 o</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dx-5-o-1627"></a><a name="index-other_002dframe-1628"></a>Select another frame, and raise it.  If you repeat this command, it
cycles through all the frames on your terminal.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-x 5 1</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dx-5-1-1629"></a><a name="index-delete_002dother_002dframes-1630"></a>Delete all frames on the current terminal, except the selected one.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-&lt;F10&gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-M_002d_003cF10_003e-1631"></a><a name="index-toggle_002dframe_002dmaximized-1632"></a>Toggle the maximization state of the current frame.  When a frame is
maximized, it fills the screen.

     <br><dt><kbd>&lt;F11&gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-g_t_003cF11_003e-1633"></a><a name="index-toggle_002dframe_002dfullscreen-1634"></a>Toggle full-screen mode for the current frame.  (The difference
between full-screen and maximized is normally that the former
hides window manager decorations, giving slightly more screen space to
Emacs itself.) 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-frame_002dresize_002dpixelwise-1635"></a>  Note that with some window managers you may have to customize the
variable <code>frame-resize-pixelwise</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> value in
order to make a frame truly maximized or full-screen.  This
variable, when set to a non-<code>nil</code> value, in general allows
resizing frames at pixel resolution, rather than in integral multiples
of lines and columns.

   <p>The <kbd>C-x 5 0</kbd> (<code>delete-frame</code>) command deletes the selected
frame.  However, it will refuse to delete the last frame in an Emacs
session, to prevent you from losing the ability to interact with the
Emacs session.  Note that when Emacs is run as a daemon (see <a href="#Emacs-Server">Emacs Server</a>), there is always a virtual frame that remains after all
the ordinary, interactive frames are deleted.  In this case, <kbd>C-x
5 0</kbd> can delete the last interactive frame; you can use
<samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp> to reconnect to the Emacs session.

   <p>The <kbd>C-x 5 1</kbd> (<code>delete-other-frames</code>) command deletes all
other frames on the current terminal (this terminal refers to either a
graphical display, or a text terminal; see <a href="#Non_002dWindow-Terminals">Non-Window Terminals</a>). 
If the Emacs session has frames open on other graphical displays or
text terminals, those are not deleted.

   <p><a name="index-focus_002dfollows_002dmouse-1636"></a>  The <kbd>C-x 5 o</kbd> (<code>other-frame</code>) command selects the next
frame on the current terminal.  If you are using Emacs on the X Window
System with a window manager that selects (or <dfn>gives focus to</dfn>)
whatever frame the mouse cursor is over, you have to change the
variable <code>focus-follows-mouse</code> to <code>t</code> in order for this
command to work properly.  Then invoking <kbd>C-x 5 o</kbd> will also warp
the mouse cursor to the chosen frame.

<h3 class="section">21.8 Fonts</h3>

<p><a name="index-fonts-1637"></a>
  By default, Emacs displays text on graphical displays using a
10-point monospace font.  There are several different ways to specify
a different font:

     <ul>
<li>Click on `<samp><span class="samp">Set Default Font</span></samp>' in the `<samp><span class="samp">Options</span></samp>' menu.  This
makes the selected font the default on all existing graphical frames. 
To save this for future sessions, click on `<samp><span class="samp">Save Options</span></samp>' in the
`<samp><span class="samp">Options</span></samp>' menu.

     <li>Add a line to your init file, modifying the variable
<code>default-frame-alist</code> to specify the <code>font</code> parameter
(see <a href="#Frame-Parameters">Frame Parameters</a>), like this:

     <pre class="example">          (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist
                       '(font . "DejaVu Sans Mono-10"))
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">This makes the font the default on all graphical frames created after
restarting Emacs with that init file.

     <p><a name="index-X-defaults-file-1638"></a><a name="index-X-resources-file-1639"></a><li>Add an `<samp><span class="samp">emacs.font</span></samp>' X resource setting to your X resource file,
like this:

     <pre class="example">          emacs.font: DejaVu Sans Mono-12
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">You must restart X, or use the <samp><span class="command">xrdb</span></samp> command, for the X
resources file to take effect.  See <a href="#Resources">Resources</a>.  Do not quote
font names in X resource files.

     <li>If you are running Emacs on the GNOME desktop, you can tell Emacs to
use the default system font by setting the variable
<code>font-use-system-font</code> to <code>t</code> (the default is <code>nil</code>). 
For this to work, Emacs must have been compiled with Gconf support.

     <li>Use the command line option `<samp><span class="samp">-fn</span></samp>' (or `<samp><span class="samp">--font</span></samp>').  See <a href="#Font-X">Font X</a>. 
</ul>

   <p>To check what font you're currently using, the <kbd>C-u C-x =</kbd>
command can be helpful.  It describes the character at point, and
names the font that it's rendered in.

   <p><a name="index-fontconfig-1640"></a>  On X, there are four different ways to express a font name.  The
first is to use a <dfn>Fontconfig pattern</dfn>.  Fontconfig patterns have
the following form:

<pre class="example">     <var>fontname</var>[-<var>fontsize</var>][:<var>name1</var>=<var>values1</var>][:<var>name2</var>=<var>values2</var>]...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Within this format, any of the elements in brackets may be omitted. 
Here, <var>fontname</var> is the <dfn>family name</dfn> of the font, such as
`<samp><span class="samp">Monospace</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">DejaVu Sans Mono</span></samp>'; <var>fontsize</var> is the
<dfn>point size</dfn> of the font (one <dfn>printer's point</dfn> is about 1/72
of an inch); and the `<samp><var>name</var><span class="samp">=</span><var>values</var></samp>' entries specify
settings such as the slant and weight of the font.  Each <var>values</var>
may be a single value, or a list of values separated by commas.  In
addition, some property values are valid with only one kind of
property name, in which case the `<samp><var>name</var><span class="samp">=</span></samp>' part may be
omitted.

   <p>Here is a list of common font properties:

     <dl>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">slant</span></samp>'<dd>One of `<samp><span class="samp">italic</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">oblique</span></samp>', or `<samp><span class="samp">roman</span></samp>'.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">weight</span></samp>'<dd>One of `<samp><span class="samp">light</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">medium</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">demibold</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">bold</span></samp>' or
`<samp><span class="samp">black</span></samp>'.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">style</span></samp>'<dd>Some fonts define special styles which are a combination of slant and
weight.  For instance, `<samp><span class="samp">Dejavu Sans</span></samp>' defines the `<samp><span class="samp">book</span></samp>'
style, which overrides the slant and weight properties.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">width</span></samp>'<dd>One of `<samp><span class="samp">condensed</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">normal</span></samp>', or `<samp><span class="samp">expanded</span></samp>'.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">spacing</span></samp>'<dd>One of `<samp><span class="samp">monospace</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">proportional</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">dual-width</span></samp>', or
`<samp><span class="samp">charcell</span></samp>'. 
</dl>

<p class="noindent">Here are some examples of Fontconfig patterns:

<pre class="example">     Monospace
     Monospace-12
     Monospace-12:bold
     DejaVu Sans Mono:bold:italic
     Monospace-12:weight=bold:slant=italic
</pre>
   <p>For a more detailed description of Fontconfig patterns, see the
Fontconfig manual, which is distributed with Fontconfig and available
online at <a href="http://fontconfig.org/fontconfig-user.html">http://fontconfig.org/fontconfig-user.html</a>.

   <p><a name="index-GTK-font-pattern-1641"></a>  The second way to specify a font is to use a <dfn>GTK font pattern</dfn>. 
These have the syntax

<pre class="example">     <var>fontname</var> [<var>properties</var>] [<var>fontsize</var>]
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where <var>fontname</var> is the family name, <var>properties</var> is a list of
property values separated by spaces, and <var>fontsize</var> is the point
size.  The properties that you may specify for GTK font patterns are
as follows:

     <ul>
<li>Slant properties: `<samp><span class="samp">Italic</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">Oblique</span></samp>'.  If omitted, the
default (roman) slant is implied. 
<li>Weight properties: `<samp><span class="samp">Bold</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">Book</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">Light</span></samp>',
`<samp><span class="samp">Medium</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">Semi-bold</span></samp>', or `<samp><span class="samp">Ultra-light</span></samp>'.  If omitted,
`<samp><span class="samp">Medium</span></samp>' weight is implied. 
<li>Width properties: `<samp><span class="samp">Semi-Condensed</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">Condensed</span></samp>'.  If
omitted, a default width is used. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">Here are some examples of GTK font patterns:

<pre class="example">     Monospace 12
     Monospace Bold Italic 12
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-XLFD-1642"></a><a name="index-X-Logical-Font-Description-1643"></a>  The third way to specify a font is to use an <dfn>XLFD</dfn> (<dfn>X
Logical Font Description</dfn>).  This is the traditional method for
specifying fonts under X.  Each XLFD consists of fourteen words or
numbers, separated by dashes, like this:

<pre class="example">     -misc-fixed-medium-r-semicondensed--13-*-*-*-c-60-iso8859-1
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">A wildcard character (`<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>') in an XLFD matches any sequence of
characters (including none), and `<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>' matches any single
character.  However, matching is implementation-dependent, and can be
inaccurate when wildcards match dashes in a long name.  For reliable
results, supply all 14 dashes and use wildcards only within a field. 
Case is insignificant in an XLFD.  The syntax for an XLFD is as
follows:

<pre class="example">     -<var>maker</var>-<var>family</var>-<var>weight</var>-<var>slant</var>-<var>widthtype</var>-<var>style</var>...
     ...-<var>pixels</var>-<var>height</var>-<var>horiz</var>-<var>vert</var>-<var>spacing</var>-<var>width</var>-<var>registry</var>-<var>encoding</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The entries have the following meanings:

     <dl>
<dt><var>maker</var><dd>The name of the font manufacturer. 
<br><dt><var>family</var><dd>The name of the font family (e.g., `<samp><span class="samp">courier</span></samp>'). 
<br><dt><var>weight</var><dd>The font weight&mdash;normally either `<samp><span class="samp">bold</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">medium</span></samp>' or
`<samp><span class="samp">light</span></samp>'.  Some font names support other values. 
<br><dt><var>slant</var><dd>The font slant&mdash;normally `<samp><span class="samp">r</span></samp>' (roman), `<samp><span class="samp">i</span></samp>' (italic),
`<samp><span class="samp">o</span></samp>' (oblique), `<samp><span class="samp">ri</span></samp>' (reverse italic), or `<samp><span class="samp">ot</span></samp>' (other). 
Some font names support other values. 
<br><dt><var>widthtype</var><dd>The font width&mdash;normally `<samp><span class="samp">normal</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">condensed</span></samp>',
`<samp><span class="samp">semicondensed</span></samp>', or `<samp><span class="samp">extended</span></samp>'.  Some font names support
other values. 
<br><dt><var>style</var><dd>An optional additional style name.  Usually it is empty&mdash;most XLFDs
have two hyphens in a row at this point.  The style name can also
specify a two-letter ISO-639 language name, like `<samp><span class="samp">ja</span></samp>' or
`<samp><span class="samp">ko</span></samp>'; some fonts that support CJK scripts have that spelled out
in the style name part. 
<br><dt><var>pixels</var><dd>The font height, in pixels. 
<br><dt><var>height</var><dd>The font height on the screen, measured in tenths of a printer's
point.  This is the point size of the font, times ten.  For a given
vertical resolution, <var>height</var> and <var>pixels</var> are proportional;
therefore, it is common to specify just one of them and use `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>'
for the other. 
<br><dt><var>horiz</var><dd>The horizontal resolution, in pixels per inch, of the screen for which
the font is intended. 
<br><dt><var>vert</var><dd>The vertical resolution, in pixels per inch, of the screen for which
the font is intended.  Normally the resolution of the fonts on your
system is the right value for your screen; therefore, you normally
specify `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' for this and <var>horiz</var>. 
<br><dt><var>spacing</var><dd>This is `<samp><span class="samp">m</span></samp>' (monospace), `<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>' (proportional) or `<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>'
(character cell). 
<br><dt><var>width</var><dd>The average character width, in pixels, multiplied by ten. 
<br><dt><var>registry</var><dt><var>encoding</var><dd>The X font character set that the font depicts.  (X font character
sets are not the same as Emacs character sets, but they are similar.) 
You can use the <samp><span class="command">xfontsel</span></samp> program to check which choices you
have.  Normally you should use `<samp><span class="samp">iso8859</span></samp>' for <var>registry</var> and
`<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>' for <var>encoding</var>. 
</dl>

   <p>The fourth and final method of specifying a font is to use a font
nickname.  Certain fonts have shorter nicknames, which you can use
instead of a normal font specification.  For instance, `<samp><span class="samp">6x13</span></samp>' is
equivalent to

<pre class="example">     -misc-fixed-medium-r-semicondensed--13-*-*-*-c-60-iso8859-1
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-client_002dside-fonts-1644"></a><a name="index-server_002dside-fonts-1645"></a>  On X, Emacs recognizes two types of fonts: <dfn>client-side</dfn> fonts,
which are provided by the Xft and Fontconfig libraries, and
<dfn>server-side</dfn> fonts, which are provided by the X server itself. 
Most client-side fonts support advanced font features such as
antialiasing and subpixel hinting, while server-side fonts do not. 
Fontconfig and GTK patterns match only client-side fonts.

   <p><a name="index-listing-system-fonts-1646"></a>  You will probably want to use a fixed-width default font&mdash;that is,
a font in which all characters have the same width.  For Xft and
Fontconfig fonts, you can use the <samp><span class="command">fc-list</span></samp> command to list
the available fixed-width fonts, like this:

<pre class="example">     fc-list :spacing=mono

<h3 class="section">21.9 Speedbar Frames</h3>

<p><a name="index-speedbar-1647"></a>
<a name="index-attached-frame-_0028of-speedbar_0029-1648"></a>  The <dfn>speedbar</dfn> is a special frame for conveniently navigating in
or operating on another frame.  The speedbar, when it exists, is
always associated with a specific frame, called its <dfn>attached
frame</dfn>; all speedbar operations act on that frame.

   <p>Type <kbd>M-x speedbar</kbd> to create the speedbar and associate it with
the current frame.  To dismiss the speedbar, type <kbd>M-x speedbar</kbd>
again, or select the speedbar and type <kbd>q</kbd>.  (You can also delete
the speedbar frame like any other Emacs frame.)  If you wish to
associate the speedbar with a different frame, dismiss it and call
<kbd>M-x speedbar</kbd> from that frame.

   <p>The speedbar can operate in various modes.  Its default mode is
<dfn>File Display</dfn> mode, which shows the files in the current
directory of the selected window of the attached frame, one file per
line.  Clicking on a file name visits that file in the selected window
of the attached frame, and clicking on a directory name shows that
directory in the speedbar (see <a href="#Mouse-References">Mouse References</a>).  Each line also
has a box, `<samp><span class="samp">[+]</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">&lt;+&gt;</span></samp>', that you can click on to
<dfn>expand</dfn> the contents of that item.  Expanding a directory adds
the contents of that directory to the speedbar display, underneath the
directory's own line.  Expanding an ordinary file adds a list of the
tags in that file to the speedbar display; you can click on a tag name
to jump to that tag in the selected window of the attached frame. 
When a file or directory is expanded, the `<samp><span class="samp">[+]</span></samp>' changes to
`<samp><span class="samp">[-]</span></samp>'; you can click on that box to <dfn>contract</dfn> the item,
hiding its contents.

   <p>You navigate through the speedbar using the keyboard, too.  Typing
&lt;RET&gt; while point is on a line in the speedbar is equivalent to
clicking the item on the current line, and &lt;SPC&gt; expands or
contracts the item.  <kbd>U</kbd> displays the parent directory of the
current directory.  To copy, delete, or rename the file on the current
line, type <kbd>C</kbd>, <kbd>D</kbd>, and <kbd>R</kbd> respectively.  To create a
new directory, type <kbd>M</kbd>.

   <p>Another general-purpose speedbar mode is <dfn>Buffer Display</dfn> mode;
in this mode, the speedbar displays a list of Emacs buffers.  To
switch to this mode, type <kbd>b</kbd> in the speedbar.  To return to File
Display mode, type <kbd>f</kbd>.  You can also change the display mode by
clicking <kbd>mouse-3</kbd> anywhere in the speedbar window (or
<kbd>mouse-1</kbd> on the mode-line) and selecting `<samp><span class="samp">Displays</span></samp>' in the
pop-up menu.

   <p>Some major modes, including Rmail mode, Info, and GUD, have
specialized ways of putting useful items into the speedbar for you to
select.  For example, in Rmail mode, the speedbar shows a list of Rmail
files, and lets you move the current message to another Rmail file by
clicking on its `<samp><span class="samp">&lt;M&gt;</span></samp>' box.

   <p>For more details on using and programming the speedbar, See <a href="speedbar.html#Top">Speedbar</a>.

<h3 class="section">21.10 Multiple Displays</h3>

<p><a name="index-multiple-displays-1649"></a>
  A single Emacs can talk to more than one X display.  Initially, Emacs
uses just one display&mdash;the one specified with the <samp><span class="env">DISPLAY</span></samp>
environment variable or with the `<samp><span class="samp">--display</span></samp>' option (see <a href="#Initial-Options">Initial Options</a>).  To connect to another display, use the command
<code>make-frame-on-display</code>:

   <p><a name="index-make_002dframe_002don_002ddisplay-1650"></a>
     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-x make-frame-on-display &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>display</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Create a new frame on display <var>display</var>. 
</dl>

   <p>A single X server can handle more than one screen.  When you open
frames on two screens belonging to one server, Emacs knows they share a
single keyboard, and it treats all the commands arriving from these
screens as a single stream of input.

   <p>When you open frames on different X servers, Emacs makes a separate
input stream for each server.  Each server also has its own selected
frame.  The commands you enter with a particular X server apply to
that server's selected frame.

<h3 class="section">21.11 Frame Parameters</h3>

<p><a name="index-default_002dframe_002dalist-1651"></a>
  You can control the default appearance and behavior of all frames by
specifying a default list of <dfn>frame parameters</dfn> in the variable
<code>default-frame-alist</code>.  Its value should be a list of entries,
each specifying a parameter name and a value for that parameter. 
These entries take effect whenever Emacs creates a new frame,
including the initial frame.

   <p><a name="index-frame-size_002c-specifying-default-1652"></a>  For example, you can add the following lines to your init file
(see <a href="#Init-File">Init File</a>) to set the default frame width to 90 character
columns, the default frame height to 40 character rows, and the
default font to `<samp><span class="samp">Monospace-10</span></samp>':

<pre class="example">     (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(width  . 90))
     (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(height . 40))
     (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(font . "Monospace-10"))
</pre>
   <p>For a list of frame parameters and their effects, see <a href="elisp.html#Frame-Parameters">Frame Parameters</a>.

   <p><a name="index-initial_002dframe_002dalist-1653"></a>  You can also specify a list of frame parameters which apply to just
the initial frame, by customizing the variable
<code>initial-frame-alist</code>.

   <p>If Emacs is compiled to use an X toolkit, frame parameters that
specify colors and fonts don't affect menus and the menu bar, since
those are drawn by the toolkit and not directly by Emacs.

<h3 class="section">21.12 Scroll Bars</h3>

<p><a name="index-Scroll-Bar-mode-1654"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Scroll-Bar-1655"></a><a name="index-Vertical-Scroll-Bar-1656"></a>
  On graphical displays, there is a <dfn>vertical scroll bar</dfn> on the
side of each Emacs window.  Clicking <kbd>mouse-1</kbd> on the scroll bar's
up and down buttons scrolls the window by one line at a time.  Clicking
<kbd>mouse-1</kbd> above or below the scroll bar's inner box scrolls the
window by nearly the entire height of the window, like <kbd>M-v</kbd> and
<kbd>C-v</kbd> respectively (see <a href="#Moving-Point">Moving Point</a>).  Dragging the inner box
scrolls continuously.

   <p>If Emacs is compiled on the X Window System without X toolkit
support, the scroll bar behaves differently.  Clicking <kbd>mouse-1</kbd>
anywhere on the scroll bar scrolls forward like <kbd>C-v</kbd>, while
<kbd>mouse-3</kbd> scrolls backward like <kbd>M-v</kbd>.  Clicking <kbd>mouse-2</kbd>
in the scroll bar lets you drag the inner box up and down.

   <p><a name="index-scroll_002dbar_002dmode-1657"></a><a name="index-toggle_002dscroll_002dbar-1658"></a>  To toggle the use of vertical scroll bars, type <kbd>M-x
scroll-bar-mode</kbd>.  This command applies to all frames, including frames
yet to be created.  To toggle vertical scroll bars for just the selected
frame, use the command <kbd>M-x toggle-scroll-bar</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-scroll_002dbar_002dmode-1659"></a>  To control the use of vertical scroll bars at startup, customize the
variable <code>scroll-bar-mode</code>.  Its value should be either
<code>right</code> (put scroll bars on the right side of windows), <code>left</code>
(put them on the left), or <code>nil</code> (disable vertical scroll bars). 
By default, Emacs puts scroll bars on the right if it was compiled with
GTK+ support on the X Window System, and on MS-Windows or Mac OS; Emacs
puts scroll bars on the left if compiled on the X Window System without
GTK+ support (following the old convention for X applications).

   <p><a name="index-scroll_002dbar_002dwidth-1660"></a><a name="index-width-of-the-vertical-scroll-bar-1661"></a>  You can also use the X resource `<samp><span class="samp">verticalScrollBars</span></samp>' to enable
or disable the scroll bars (see <a href="#Resources">Resources</a>).  To control the scroll
bar width, change the <code>scroll-bar-width</code> frame parameter
(see <a href="elisp.html#Frame-Parameters">Frame Parameters</a>).

   <p><a name="index-scroll_002dbar_002dadjust_002dthumb_002dportion-1662"></a><a name="index-overscrolling-1663"></a>If you're using Emacs on X (with GTK+ or Motif), you can customize the
variable <code>scroll-bar-adjust-thumb-portion</code> to control
<dfn>overscrolling</dfn> of the scroll bar, i.e., dragging the thumb down even
when the end of the buffer is visible.  If its value is
non-<code>nil</code>, the scroll bar can be dragged downwards even if the
end of the buffer is shown; if <code>nil</code>, the thumb will be at the
bottom when the end of the buffer is shown.  You can not over-scroll
when the entire buffer is visible.

   <p><a name="index-scroll_002dbar-face-1664"></a>  The visual appearance of the scroll bars is controlled by the
<code>scroll-bar</code> face.

   <p><a name="index-Horizontal-Scroll-Bar-1665"></a><a name="index-Horizontal-Scroll-Bar-mode-1666"></a>  On graphical displays with toolkit support, Emacs may also supply a
<dfn>horizontal scroll bar</dfn> on the bottom of each window.  Clicking
<kbd>mouse-1</kbd> on the that scroll bar's left and right buttons scrolls
the window horizontally by one column at a time.  Clicking <kbd>mouse-1</kbd>
on the left or right of the scroll bar's inner box scrolls the window by
four columns.  Dragging the inner box scrolls the window continuously.

   <p>Note that such horizontal scrolling can make the window's position of
point disappear on the left or the right.  Typing a character to insert
text or moving point with a keyboard command will usually bring it back
into view.

   <p><a name="index-horizontal_002dscroll_002dbar_002dmode-1667"></a>  To toggle the use of horizontal scroll bars, type <kbd>M-x
horizontal-scroll-bar-mode</kbd>.  This command applies to all frames,
including frames yet to be created.  To toggle horizontal scroll bars
for just the selected frame, use the command <kbd>M-x
toggle-horizontal-scroll-bar</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-horizontal_002dscroll_002dbar_002dmode-1668"></a>  To control the use of horizontal scroll bars at startup, customize the
variable <code>horizontal-scroll-bar-mode</code>.

   <p><a name="index-scroll_002dbar_002dheight-1669"></a><a name="index-height-of-the-horizontal-scroll-bar-1670"></a>  You can also use the X resource `<samp><span class="samp">horizontalScrollBars</span></samp>' to enable
or disable horizontal scroll bars (see <a href="#Resources">Resources</a>).  To control the
scroll bar height, change the <code>scroll-bar-height</code> frame parameter
(see <a href="elisp.html#Frame-Parameters">Frame Parameters</a>).

  On graphical displays, you can use <dfn>window dividers</dfn> in order to
separate windows visually.  Window dividers are bars that can be dragged
with the mouse, thus allowing to easily resize adjacent windows.

   <p><a name="index-window_002ddivider_002dmode-1673"></a>  To toggle the display of window dividers, use the command <kbd>M-x
window-divider-mode</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-window_002ddivider_002ddefault_002dplaces-1674"></a>  To customize where dividers should appear, use the option
<code>window-divider-default-places</code>.  Its value should be either
<code>bottom-only</code> (to show dividers only on the bottom of windows),
<code>right-only</code> (to show dividers only on the right of windows), or
<code>t</code> (to show them on the bottom and on the right).

   <p><a name="index-window_002ddivider_002ddefault_002dbottom_002dwidth-1675"></a><a name="index-window_002ddivider_002ddefault_002dright_002dwidth-1676"></a>  To adjust the width of window dividers displayed by this mode
customize the options <code>window-divider-default-bottom-width</code> and
<code>window-divider-default-right-width</code>.

<h3 class="section">21.14 Drag and Drop</h3>

<p><a name="index-drag-and-drop-1677"></a>
  In most graphical desktop environments, Emacs has basic support for
<dfn>drag and drop</dfn> operations.  For instance, dropping text onto an
Emacs frame inserts the text where it is dropped.  Dropping a file
onto an Emacs frame visits that file.  As a special case, dropping the
file on a Dired buffer moves or copies the file (according to the
conventions of the application it came from) into the directory
displayed in that buffer.

   <p><a name="index-dnd_002dopen_002dfile_002dother_002dwindow-1678"></a>  Dropping a file normally visits it in the window you drop it on.  If
you prefer to visit the file in a new window in such cases, customize
the variable <code>dnd-open-file-other-window</code>.

   <p>The XDND and Motif drag and drop protocols, and the old KDE 1.x
protocol, are currently supported.

  You can toggle the use of menu bars with <kbd>M-x menu-bar-mode</kbd>. 
With no argument, this command toggles Menu Bar mode, a global minor
mode.  With an argument, the command turns Menu Bar mode on if the
argument is positive, off if the argument is not positive.  To control
the use of menu bars at startup, customize the variable
<code>menu-bar-mode</code>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dmouse_002d3-_0040r_007b_0028when-menu-bar-is-disabled_0029_007d-1683"></a>  Expert users often turn off the menu bar, especially on text
terminals, where this makes one additional line available for text. 
If the menu bar is off, you can still pop up a menu of its contents
with <kbd>C-mouse-3</kbd> on a display which supports pop-up menus.

  On graphical displays, Emacs puts a <dfn>tool bar</dfn> at the top of
each frame, just below the menu bar.  This is a row of icons which you
can click on with the mouse to invoke various commands.

   <p>The global (default) tool bar contains general commands.  Some major
modes define their own tool bars; whenever a buffer with such a major
mode is current, the mode's tool bar replaces the global tool bar.

   <p><a name="index-tool_002dbar_002dmode-1687"></a><a name="index-tool_002dbar_002dmode-1688"></a>  To toggle the use of tool bars, type <kbd>M-x tool-bar-mode</kbd>.  This

   <p><a name="index-tool_002dbar_002dstyle-1689"></a><a name="index-Tool-Bar-style-1690"></a>  When Emacs is compiled with GTK+ support, each tool bar item can
consist of an image, or a text label, or both.  By default, Emacs
follows the Gnome desktop's tool bar style setting; if none is
defined, it displays tool bar items as just images.  To impose a
specific tool bar style, customize the variable <code>tool-bar-style</code>.

   <p><a name="index-Tool-Bar-position-1691"></a>  You can also control the placement of the tool bar for the GTK+ tool

<p><a name="index-dialog-boxes-1692"></a>
<a name="index-use_002ddialog_002dbox-1693"></a>  A dialog box is a special kind of menu for asking you a yes-or-no
question or some other special question.  Many Emacs commands use a
dialog box to ask a yes-or-no question, if you used the mouse to
invoke the command that led to the question.

   <p>To disable the use of dialog boxes, change the variable
<code>use-dialog-box</code> to <code>nil</code>.  In that case, Emacs always
performs yes-or-no prompts using the echo area and keyboard input. 
This variable also controls whether to use file selection windows (but
those are not supported on all platforms).

   <p><a name="index-use_002dfile_002ddialog-1694"></a><a name="index-file-selection-dialog_002c-how-to-disable-1695"></a>  A file selection window is a special kind of dialog box for asking
for file names.  You can customize the variable <code>use-file-dialog</code>
to suppress the use of file selection windows, even if you still want
other kinds of dialogs.  This variable has no effect if you have
suppressed all dialog boxes with the variable <code>use-dialog-box</code>.

   <p><a name="index-x_002dgtk_002dshow_002dhidden_002dfiles-1696"></a><a name="index-x_002dgtk_002dfile_002ddialog_002dhelp_002dtext-1697"></a><a name="index-hidden-files_002c-in-GTK_002b-file-chooser-1698"></a><a name="index-help-text_002c-in-GTK_002b-file-chooser-1699"></a>  When Emacs is compiled with GTK+ support, it uses the GTK+ file
chooser dialog.  Emacs adds an additional toggle button to this
dialog, which you can use to enable or disable the display of hidden
files (files starting with a dot) in that dialog.  If you want this
toggle to be activated by default, change the variable
<code>x-gtk-show-hidden-files</code> to <code>t</code>.  In addition, Emacs adds
help text to the GTK+ file chooser dialog; to disable this help text,
change the variable <code>x-gtk-file-dialog-help-text</code> to <code>nil</code>.

<h3 class="section">21.18 Tooltips</h3>

<p><a name="index-tooltips-1700"></a>
  <dfn>Tooltips</dfn> are small special frames that display text
information at the current mouse position.  They activate when there
is a pause in mouse movement over some significant piece of text in a
window, or the mode line, or some other part of the Emacs frame such
as a tool bar button or menu item.

   <p><a name="index-tooltip_002dmode-1701"></a>  You can toggle the use of tooltips with the command <kbd>M-x
tooltip-mode</kbd>.  When Tooltip mode is disabled, the help text is
displayed in the echo area instead.  To control the use of tooltips at
startup, customize the variable <code>tooltip-mode</code>.

   <p>The following variables provide customization options for tooltip
display:

     <dl>
<dt><code>tooltip-delay</code><a name="index-tooltip_002ddelay-1702"></a><dd>This variable specifies how long Emacs should wait before displaying
the first tooltip.  The value is in seconds.

     <br><dt><code>tooltip-short-delay</code><a name="index-tooltip_002dshort_002ddelay-1703"></a><dd>This variable specifies how long Emacs should wait before displaying
subsequent tooltips on different items, having already displayed the
first tooltip.  The value is in seconds.

     <br><dt><code>tooltip-hide-delay</code><a name="index-tooltip_002dhide_002ddelay-1704"></a><dd>The number of seconds since displaying a tooltip to hide it, if the
mouse doesn't move.

     <br><dt><code>tooltip-x-offset</code><a name="index-tooltip_002dx_002doffset-1705"></a><dt><code>tooltip-y-offset</code><a name="index-tooltip_002dy_002doffset-1706"></a><dd>The X and Y offsets, in pixels, of the left top corner of the tooltip
from the mouse pointer position.  Note that these are ignored if
<code>tooltip-frame-parameters</code> was customized to include,
respectively, the <code>left</code> and <code>top</code> parameters.  The values
of the offsets should be chosen so that the tooltip doesn't cover the
mouse pointer's hot spot, or it might interfere with clicking the
mouse.

     <br><dt><code>tooltip-frame-parameters</code><a name="index-tooltip_002dframe_002dparameters-1707"></a><dd>The frame parameters used for displaying tooltips.  See <a href="elisp.html#Frame-Parameters">Frame Parameters</a>, and also

   <p>For additional customization options for displaying tooltips, use
<kbd>M-x customize-group &lt;RET&gt; tooltip &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-x_002dgtk_002duse_002dsystem_002dtooltips-1708"></a>  If Emacs is built with GTK+ support, it displays tooltips via GTK+,
using the default appearance of GTK+ tooltips.  To disable this,
change the variable <code>x-gtk-use-system-tooltips</code> to <code>nil</code>. 
If you do this, or if Emacs is built without GTK+ support, most
attributes of the tooltip text are specified by the <code>tooltip</code>
face, and by X resources (see <a href="#X-Resources">X Resources</a>).

   <p><dfn>GUD tooltips</dfn> are special tooltips that show the values of
variables when debugging a program with GUD.  See <a href="#Debugger-Operation">Debugger Operation</a>.

<h3 class="section">21.19 Mouse Avoidance</h3>

<p><a name="index-avoiding-mouse-in-the-way-of-your-typing-1709"></a><a name="index-mouse-avoidance-1710"></a>
  On graphical terminals, the mouse pointer may obscure the text in
the Emacs frame.  Emacs provides two methods to avoid this problem.

   <p><a name="index-make_002dpointer_002dinvisible-1711"></a>  Firstly, Emacs hides the mouse pointer each time you type a
self-inserting character, if the pointer lies inside an Emacs frame;
moving the mouse pointer makes it visible again.  To disable this
feature, set the variable <code>make-pointer-invisible</code> to <code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-mouse_002davoidance_002dmode-1712"></a>  Secondly, you can use Mouse Avoidance mode, a minor mode, to keep
the mouse pointer away from point.  To use Mouse Avoidance mode,
customize the variable <code>mouse-avoidance-mode</code>.  You can set this
to various values to move the mouse in several ways:

     <dl>
<dt><code>banish</code><dd>Move the pointer to a corner of the frame on any key-press.  You can
customize the variable <code>mouse-avoidance-banish-position</code> to
specify where the pointer goes when it is banished. 
<br><dt><code>exile</code><dd>Banish the pointer only if the cursor gets too close, and allow it to
return once the cursor is out of the way. 
<br><dt><code>jump</code><dd>If the cursor gets too close to the pointer, displace the pointer by a
random distance and direction. 
<br><dt><code>animate</code><dd>As <code>jump</code>, but shows steps along the way for illusion of motion. 
<br><dt><code>cat-and-mouse</code><dd>The same as <code>animate</code>. 
<br><dt><code>proteus</code><dd>As <code>animate</code>, but changes the shape of the mouse pointer too. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-mouse_002davoidance_002dmode-1713"></a>You can also use the command <kbd>M-x mouse-avoidance-mode</kbd> to enable
the mode.  Whenever Mouse Avoidance mode moves the mouse, it also
raises the frame.

<h3 class="section">21.20 Non-Window Terminals</h3>

<p><a name="index-text-terminal-1714"></a>
  On a text terminal, Emacs can display only one Emacs frame at a
time.  However, you can still create multiple Emacs frames, and switch
between them.  Switching frames on these terminals is much like
switching between different window configurations.

   <p>Use <kbd>C-x 5 2</kbd> to create a new frame and switch to it; use <kbd>C-x
5 o</kbd> to cycle through the existing frames; use <kbd>C-x 5 0</kbd> to delete
the current frame.

   <p>Each frame has a number to distinguish it.  If your terminal can
display only one frame at a time, the selected frame's number <var>n</var>
appears near the beginning of the mode line, in the form
`<samp><span class="samp">F</span><var>n</var></samp>'.

   <p><a name="index-set_002dframe_002dname-1715"></a><a name="index-select_002dframe_002dby_002dname-1716"></a>  `<samp><span class="samp">F</span><var>n</var></samp>' is in fact the frame's initial name.  You can give
frames more meaningful names if you wish, and you can select a frame
by its name.  Use the command <kbd>M-x set-frame-name &lt;RET&gt;
</kbd><var>name</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> to specify a new name for the selected frame,
and use <kbd>M-x select-frame-by-name &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>name</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
to select a frame according to its name.  The name you specify appears
in the mode line when the frame is selected.

<h3 class="section">21.21 Using a Mouse in Text Terminals</h3>

<p><a name="index-mouse-support-1717"></a><a name="index-terminal-emulators_002c-mouse-support-1718"></a>
Some text terminals support mouse clicks in the terminal window.

   <p><a name="index-xterm-1719"></a>  In a terminal emulator which is compatible with <samp><span class="command">xterm</span></samp>, you
can use <kbd>M-x xterm-mouse-mode</kbd> to give Emacs control over simple
uses of the mouse&mdash;basically, only non-modified single clicks are
supported.  Newer versions of <samp><span class="command">xterm</span></samp> also support
mouse-tracking.  The normal <samp><span class="command">xterm</span></samp> mouse functionality for
such clicks is still available by holding down the <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> key
when you press the mouse button.  Xterm Mouse mode is a global minor
mode (see <a href="#Minor-Modes">Minor Modes</a>).  Repeating the command turns the mode off
again.

   <p><a name="index-gpm_002dmouse_002dmode-1720"></a>  In the console on GNU/Linux, you can use <kbd>M-x gpm-mouse-mode</kbd> to
enable mouse support.  You must have the gpm server installed and
running on your system in order for this to work.  Note that when
this mode is enabled, you cannot use the mouse to transfer text
between Emacs and other programs which use GPM.  This is due to
limitations in GPM and the Linux kernel.

   <p>See <a href="#MS_002dDOS-Mouse">MS-DOS Mouse</a>,
for information about mouse support on MS-DOS.

including European and Vietnamese variants of the Latin alphabet, as
well as Arabic scripts, Brahmic scripts (for languages such as
Bengali, Hindi, and Thai), Cyrillic, Ethiopic, Georgian, Greek, Han
(for Chinese and Japanese), Hangul (for Korean), Hebrew and IPA. 
Emacs also supports various encodings of these characters that are used by
other internationalized software, such as word processors and mailers.

   <p>Emacs allows editing text with international characters by supporting
all the related activities:

     <ul>
<li>You can visit files with non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters, save non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> text, and
pass non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> text between Emacs and programs it invokes (such as
compilers, spell-checkers, and mailers).  Setting your language
environment (see <a href="#Language-Environments">Language Environments</a>) takes care of setting up the
coding systems and other options for a specific language or culture. 
Alternatively, you can specify how Emacs should encode or decode text
for each command; see <a href="#Text-Coding">Text Coding</a>.

     <li>You can display non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters encoded by the various
scripts.  This works by using appropriate fonts on graphics displays
(see <a href="#Defining-Fontsets">Defining Fontsets</a>), and by sending special codes to text
displays (see <a href="#Terminal-Coding">Terminal Coding</a>).  If some characters are displayed
incorrectly, refer to <a href="#Undisplayable-Characters">Undisplayable Characters</a>, which describes
possible problems and explains how to solve them.

     <li>Characters from scripts whose natural ordering of text is from right
to left are reordered for display (see <a href="#Bidirectional-Editing">Bidirectional Editing</a>). 
These scripts include Arabic, Hebrew, Syriac, Thaana, and a few
others.

     <li>You can insert non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters or search for them.  To do that,
you can specify an input method (see <a href="#Select-Input-Method">Select Input Method</a>) suitable
for your language, or use the default input method set up when you chose
your language environment.  If
your keyboard can produce non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters, you can select an
appropriate keyboard coding system (see <a href="#Terminal-Coding">Terminal Coding</a>), and Emacs
will accept those characters.  Latin-1 characters can also be input by
using the <kbd>C-x 8</kbd> prefix, see <a href="#Unibyte-Mode">Unibyte Mode</a>.

     <p>With the X Window System, your locale should be set to an appropriate
value to make sure Emacs interprets keyboard input correctly; see
<a href="#Language-Environments">locales</a>. 
</ul>

<h3 class="section">22.1 Introduction to International Character Sets</h3>

<p>The users of international character sets and scripts have
established many more-or-less standard coding systems for storing
files.  These coding systems are typically <dfn>multibyte</dfn>, meaning
that sequences of two or more bytes are used to represent individual
non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters.

   <p><a name="index-Unicode-1742"></a>  Internally, Emacs uses its own multibyte character encoding, which
is a superset of the <dfn>Unicode</dfn> standard.  This internal encoding
allows characters from almost every known script to be intermixed in a
single buffer or string.  Emacs translates between the multibyte
character encoding and various other coding systems when reading and
writing files, and when exchanging data with subprocesses.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dh-h-1743"></a><a name="index-view_002dhello_002dfile-1744"></a><a name="index-undisplayable-characters-1745"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_003f_007d-in-display-1746"></a>  The command <kbd>C-h h</kbd> (<code>view-hello-file</code>) displays the file
<samp><span class="file">etc/HELLO</span></samp>, which illustrates various scripts by showing
how to say &ldquo;hello&rdquo; in many languages.  If some characters can't be
displayed on your terminal, they appear as `<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>' or as hollow boxes
(see <a href="#Undisplayable-Characters">Undisplayable Characters</a>).

   <p>Keyboards, even in the countries where these character sets are
used, generally don't have keys for all the characters in them.  You
can insert characters that your keyboard does not support, using
<kbd>C-x 8 &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> (<code>insert-char</code>).  See <a href="#Inserting-Text">Inserting Text</a>. 
Shorthands are available for some common characters; for example, you
can insert a left single quotation mark <tt>‘</tt> by typing <kbd>C-x 8
[</kbd>, or in Electric Quote mode often by simply typing <kbd>`</kbd>. 
See <a href="#Quotation-Marks">Quotation Marks</a>.  Emacs also supports
various <dfn>input methods</dfn>, typically one for each script or
language, which make it easier to type characters in the script. 
See <a href="#Input-Methods">Input Methods</a>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-RET-1747"></a>  The prefix key <kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> is used for commands that pertain
to multibyte characters, coding systems, and input methods.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-_003d-1748"></a><a name="index-what_002dcursor_002dposition-1749"></a>  The command <kbd>C-x =</kbd> (<code>what-cursor-position</code>) shows
information about the character at point.  In addition to the
character position, which was described in <a href="#Position-Info">Position Info</a>, this
command displays how the character is encoded.  For instance, it
displays the following line in the echo area for the character
`<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>':

<pre class="smallexample">     Char: c (99, #o143, #x63) point=28062 of 36168 (78%) column=53
</pre>
   <p>The four values after `<samp><span class="samp">Char:</span></samp>' describe the character that
follows point, first by showing it and then by giving its character
code in decimal, octal and hex.  For a non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> multibyte
character, these are followed by `<samp><span class="samp">file</span></samp>' and the character's
representation, in hex, in the buffer's coding system, if that coding
system encodes the character safely and with a single byte
(see <a href="#Coding-Systems">Coding Systems</a>).  If the character's encoding is longer than
one byte, Emacs shows `<samp><span class="samp">file ...</span></samp>'.

   <p>As a special case, if the character lies in the range 128 (0200
octal) through 159 (0237 octal), it stands for a raw byte that
does not correspond to any specific displayable character.  Such a
character lies within the <code>eight-bit-control</code> character set,
and is displayed as an escaped octal character code.  In this case,
<kbd>C-x =</kbd> shows `<samp><span class="samp">part of display ...</span></samp>' instead of `<samp><span class="samp">file</span></samp>'.

   <p><a name="index-character-set-of-character-at-point-1750"></a><a name="index-font-of-character-at-point-1751"></a><a name="index-text-properties-at-point-1752"></a><a name="index-face-at-point-1753"></a>  With a prefix argument (<kbd>C-u C-x =</kbd>), this command displays a
detailed description of the character in a window:

     <ul>
<li>The character set name, and the codes that identify the character
within that character set; <acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters are identified
as belonging to the <code>ascii</code> character set.

     <li>The character's script, syntax and categories.

     <li>What keys to type to input the character in the current input method
(if it supports the character).

     <li>The character's encodings, both internally in the buffer, and externally
if you were to save the file.

     <li>If you are running Emacs on a graphical display, the font name and
glyph code for the character.  If you are running Emacs on a text
terminal, the code(s) sent to the terminal.

     <li>The character's text properties (see <a href="elisp.html#Text-Properties">Text Properties</a>), including any non-default
faces used to display the character, and any overlays containing it
(see <a href="elisp.html#Overlays">Overlays</a>). 
</ul>

   <p>Here's an example, with some lines folded to fit into this manual:

<pre class="smallexample">                  position: 1 of 1 (0%), column: 0

<h3 class="section">22.2 Language Environments</h3>

<p><a name="index-language-environments-1754"></a>
  All supported character sets are supported in Emacs buffers whenever
multibyte characters are enabled; there is no need to select a
particular language in order to display its characters. 
However, it is important to select a <dfn>language
environment</dfn> in order to set various defaults.  Roughly speaking, the
language environment represents a choice of preferred script rather
than a choice of language.

   <p>The language environment controls which coding systems to recognize
when reading text (see <a href="#Recognize-Coding">Recognize Coding</a>).  This applies to files,
incoming mail, and any other text you read into Emacs.  It may also
specify the default coding system to use when you create a file.  Each
language environment also specifies a default input method.

   <p><a name="index-set_002dlanguage_002denvironment-1755"></a><a name="index-current_002dlanguage_002denvironment-1756"></a>  To select a language environment, customize
<code>current-language-environment</code> or use the command <kbd>M-x
set-language-environment</kbd>.  It makes no difference which buffer is
current when you use this command, because the effects apply globally
to the Emacs session.  See the variable <code>language-info-alist</code> for
the list of supported language environments, and use the command
<kbd>C-h L </kbd><var>lang-env</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> (<code>describe-language-environment</code>)
for more information about the language environment <var>lang-env</var>. 
Supported language environments include:

<!-- @cindex entries below are split between portions of the list to -->
<!-- make them more accurate, i.e., land on the line that mentions the -->
<!-- language.  However, makeinfo 4.x doesn't fill inside @quotation -->
<!-- lines that follow a @cindex entry and whose text has no whitespace. -->
<!-- To work around, we group the language environments together, so -->
<!-- that the blank that separates them triggers refill. -->

   <p>To display the script(s) used by your language environment on a
graphical display, you need to have suitable fonts. 
See <a href="#Fontsets">Fontsets</a>, for more details about setting up your fonts.

   <p><a name="index-set_002dlocale_002denvironment-1814"></a><a name="index-locale_002dlanguage_002dnames-1815"></a><a name="index-locale_002dcharset_002dlanguage_002dnames-1816"></a><a name="index-locales-1817"></a>  Some operating systems let you specify the character-set locale you
are using by setting the locale environment variables <samp><span class="env">LC_ALL</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="env">LC_CTYPE</span></samp>, or <samp><span class="env">LANG</span></samp>.  (If more than one of these is
set, the first one that is nonempty specifies your locale for this
purpose.)  During startup, Emacs looks up your character-set locale's
name in the system locale alias table, matches its canonical name
against entries in the value of the variables
<code>locale-charset-language-names</code> and <code>locale-language-names</code>
(the former overrides the latter),
and selects the corresponding language environment if a match is found. 
It also adjusts the display
table and terminal coding system, the locale coding system, the
preferred coding system as needed for the locale, and&mdash;last but not
least&mdash;the way Emacs decodes non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters sent by your keyboard.

<!-- This seems unlikely, doesn't it? -->
<p>If you modify the <samp><span class="env">LC_ALL</span></samp>, <samp><span class="env">LC_CTYPE</span></samp>, or <samp><span class="env">LANG</span></samp>
environment variables while running Emacs (by using <kbd>M-x setenv</kbd>),
you may want to invoke the <code>set-locale-environment</code>
function afterwards to readjust the language environment from the new
locale.

   <p><a name="index-locale_002dpreferred_002dcoding_002dsystems-1818"></a>  The <code>set-locale-environment</code> function normally uses the preferred
coding system established by the language environment to decode system
messages.  But if your locale matches an entry in the variable
<code>locale-preferred-coding-systems</code>, Emacs uses the corresponding
coding system instead.  For example, if the locale `<samp><span class="samp">ja_JP.PCK</span></samp>'
matches <code>japanese-shift-jis</code> in
<code>locale-preferred-coding-systems</code>, Emacs uses that encoding even
though it might normally use <code>japanese-iso-8bit</code>.

   <p>You can override the language environment chosen at startup with
explicit use of the command <code>set-language-environment</code>, or with
customization of <code>current-language-environment</code> in your init
file.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dh-L-1819"></a><a name="index-describe_002dlanguage_002denvironment-1820"></a>  To display information about the effects of a certain language
environment <var>lang-env</var>, use the command <kbd>C-h L </kbd><var>lang-env</var><kbd>
&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> (<code>describe-language-environment</code>).  This tells you
which languages this language environment is useful for, and lists the
character sets, coding systems, and input methods that go with it.  It
also shows some sample text to illustrate scripts used in this
language environment.  If you give an empty input for <var>lang-env</var>,
this command describes the chosen language environment.

   <p><a name="index-set_002dlanguage_002denvironment_002dhook-1821"></a>  You can customize any language environment with the normal hook
<code>set-language-environment-hook</code>.  The command
<code>set-language-environment</code> runs that hook after setting up the new
language environment.  The hook functions can test for a specific
language environment by checking the variable
<code>current-language-environment</code>.  This hook is where you should
put non-default settings for specific language environments, such as
coding systems for keyboard input and terminal output, the default
input method, etc.

   <p><a name="index-exit_002dlanguage_002denvironment_002dhook-1822"></a>  Before it starts to set up the new language environment,
<code>set-language-environment</code> first runs the hook
<code>exit-language-environment-hook</code>.  This hook is useful for undoing
customizations that were made with <code>set-language-environment-hook</code>. 
For instance, if you set up a special key binding in a specific language
environment using <code>set-language-environment-hook</code>, you should set
up <code>exit-language-environment-hook</code> to restore the normal binding
for that key.

<h3 class="section">22.3 Input Methods</h3>

<p><a name="index-input-methods-1823"></a>  An <dfn>input method</dfn> is a kind of character conversion designed
specifically for interactive input.  In Emacs, typically each language
has its own input method; sometimes several languages that use the same
characters can share one input method.  A few languages support several
input methods.

   <p>The simplest kind of input method works by mapping <acronym>ASCII</acronym> letters
into another alphabet; this allows you to use one other alphabet
instead of <acronym>ASCII</acronym>.  The Greek and Russian input methods
work this way.

   <p>A more powerful technique is composition: converting sequences of
characters into one letter.  Many European input methods use composition
to produce a single non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> letter from a sequence that consists of a
letter followed by accent characters (or vice versa).  For example, some
methods convert the sequence <kbd>o ^</kbd> into a single accented letter. 
These input methods have no special commands of their own; all they do
is compose sequences of printing characters.

   <p>The input methods for syllabic scripts typically use mapping followed
by composition.  The input methods for Thai and Korean work this way. 
First, letters are mapped into symbols for particular sounds or tone
marks; then, sequences of these that make up a whole syllable are
mapped into one syllable sign.

   <p>Chinese and Japanese require more complex methods.  In Chinese input
methods, first you enter the phonetic spelling of a Chinese word (in
input method <code>chinese-py</code>, among others), or a sequence of
portions of the character (input methods <code>chinese-4corner</code> and
<code>chinese-sw</code>, and others).  One input sequence typically
corresponds to many possible Chinese characters.  You select the one
you mean using keys such as <kbd>C-f</kbd>, <kbd>C-b</kbd>, <kbd>C-n</kbd>,
<kbd>C-p</kbd> (or the arrow keys), and digits, which have special meanings
in this situation.

   <p>The possible characters are conceptually arranged in several rows,
with each row holding up to 10 alternatives.  Normally, Emacs displays
just one row at a time, in the echo area; <code>(</code><var>i</var><code>/</code><var>j</var><code>)</code>
appears at the beginning, to indicate that this is the <var>i</var>th row
out of a total of <var>j</var> rows.  Type <kbd>C-n</kbd> or <kbd>C-p</kbd> to
display the next row or the previous row.

   <p>Type <kbd>C-f</kbd> and <kbd>C-b</kbd> to move forward and backward among
the alternatives in the current row.  As you do this, Emacs highlights
the current alternative with a special color; type <code>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</code>
to select the current alternative and use it as input.  The
alternatives in the row are also numbered; the number appears before
the alternative.  Typing a number selects the associated alternative
of the current row and uses it as input.

   <p>&lt;TAB&gt; in these Chinese input methods displays a buffer showing
all the possible characters at once; then clicking <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> on
one of them selects that alternative.  The keys <kbd>C-f</kbd>, <kbd>C-b</kbd>,
<kbd>C-n</kbd>, <kbd>C-p</kbd>, and digits continue to work as usual, but they
do the highlighting in the buffer showing the possible characters,
rather than in the echo area.

   <p>In Japanese input methods, first you input a whole word using
phonetic spelling; then, after the word is in the buffer, Emacs
converts it into one or more characters using a large dictionary.  One
phonetic spelling corresponds to a number of different Japanese words;
to select one of them, use <kbd>C-n</kbd> and <kbd>C-p</kbd> to cycle through
the alternatives.

   <p>Sometimes it is useful to cut off input method processing so that the
characters you have just entered will not combine with subsequent
characters.  For example, in input method <code>latin-1-postfix</code>, the
sequence <kbd>o ^</kbd> combines to form an `<samp><span class="samp">o</span></samp>' with an accent.  What if
you want to enter them as separate characters?

   <p>One way is to type the accent twice; this is a special feature for
entering the separate letter and accent.  For example, <kbd>o ^ ^</kbd> gives
you the two characters `<samp><span class="samp">o^</span></samp>'.  Another way is to type another letter
after the <kbd>o</kbd>&mdash;something that won't combine with that&mdash;and
immediately delete it.  For example, you could type <kbd>o o &lt;DEL&gt;
^</kbd> to get separate `<samp><span class="samp">o</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>'.

   <p>Another method, more general but not quite as easy to type, is to use
<kbd>C-\ C-\</kbd> between two characters to stop them from combining.  This
is the command <kbd>C-\</kbd> (<code>toggle-input-method</code>) used twice. 
See <a href="#Select-Input-Method">Select Input Method</a>.

   <p><a name="index-incremental-search_002c-input-method-interference-1824"></a>  <kbd>C-\ C-\</kbd> is especially useful inside an incremental search,
because it stops waiting for more characters to combine, and starts
searching for what you have already entered.

   <p>To find out how to input the character after point using the current
input method, type <kbd>C-u C-x =</kbd>.  See <a href="#Position-Info">Position Info</a>.

<!-- TODO: document complex-only/default/t of -->
<!-- @code{input-method-verbose-flag} -->
<p><a name="index-input_002dmethod_002dverbose_002dflag-1825"></a><a name="index-input_002dmethod_002dhighlight_002dflag-1826"></a>  The variables <code>input-method-highlight-flag</code> and
<code>input-method-verbose-flag</code> control how input methods explain
what is happening.  If <code>input-method-highlight-flag</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>, the partial sequence is highlighted in the buffer (for
most input methods&mdash;some disable this feature).  If
<code>input-method-verbose-flag</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, the list of
possible characters to type next is displayed in the echo area (but
not when you are in the minibuffer).

   <p>Another facility for typing characters not on your keyboard is by
using <kbd>C-x 8 &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> (<code>insert-char</code>) to insert a single
character based on its Unicode name or code-point; see <a href="#Inserting-Text">Inserting Text</a>.

   <p><a name="index-set_002dinput_002dmethod-1830"></a><a name="index-current_002dinput_002dmethod-1831"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-RET-C_002d_005c-1832"></a>  To choose an input method for the current buffer, use <kbd>C-x
&lt;RET&gt; C-\</kbd> (<code>set-input-method</code>).  This command reads the
input method name from the minibuffer; the name normally starts with the
language environment that it is meant to be used with.  The variable
<code>current-input-method</code> records which input method is selected.

   <p><a name="index-toggle_002dinput_002dmethod-1833"></a><a name="index-C_002d_005c-1834"></a>  Input methods use various sequences of <acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters to
stand for non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters.  Sometimes it is useful to
turn off the input method temporarily.  To do this, type <kbd>C-\</kbd>
(<code>toggle-input-method</code>).  To reenable the input method, type
<kbd>C-\</kbd> again.

   <p>If you type <kbd>C-\</kbd> and you have not yet selected an input method,
it prompts you to specify one.  This has the same effect as using
<kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt; C-\</kbd> to specify an input method.

   <p>When invoked with a numeric argument, as in <kbd>C-u C-\</kbd>,
<code>toggle-input-method</code> always prompts you for an input method,
suggesting the most recently selected one as the default.

   <p><a name="index-default_002dinput_002dmethod-1835"></a>  Selecting a language environment specifies a default input method for
use in various buffers.  When you have a default input method, you can
select it in the current buffer by typing <kbd>C-\</kbd>.  The variable
<code>default-input-method</code> specifies the default input method
(<code>nil</code> means there is none).

   <p>In some language environments, which support several different input
methods, you might want to use an input method different from the
default chosen by <code>set-language-environment</code>.  You can instruct
Emacs to select a different default input method for a certain
language environment, if you wish, by using
<code>set-language-environment-hook</code> (see <a href="#Language-Environments">set-language-environment-hook</a>).  For example:

<pre class="lisp">     (defun my-chinese-setup ()
       "Set up my private Chinese environment."
       (if (equal current-language-environment "Chinese-GB")
           (setq default-input-method "chinese-tonepy")))
     (add-hook 'set-language-environment-hook 'my-chinese-setup)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This sets the default input method to be <code>chinese-tonepy</code>
whenever you choose a Chinese-GB language environment.

   <p>You can instruct Emacs to activate a certain input method
automatically.  For example:

<pre class="lisp">     (add-hook 'text-mode-hook
       (lambda () (set-input-method "german-prefix")))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This automatically activates the input method <code>german-prefix</code> in
Text mode.

   <p><a name="index-quail_002dset_002dkeyboard_002dlayout-1836"></a>  Some input methods for alphabetic scripts work by (in effect)
remapping the keyboard to emulate various keyboard layouts commonly used
for those scripts.  How to do this remapping properly depends on your
actual keyboard layout.  To specify which layout your keyboard has, use
the command <kbd>M-x quail-set-keyboard-layout</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-quail_002dshow_002dkey-1837"></a>  You can use the command <kbd>M-x quail-show-key</kbd> to show what key (or
key sequence) to type in order to input the character following point,
using the selected keyboard layout.  The command <kbd>C-u C-x =</kbd> also
shows that information, in addition to other information about the
character.

   <p><a name="index-list_002dinput_002dmethods-1838"></a>  <kbd>M-x list-input-methods</kbd> displays a list of all the supported
input methods.  The list gives information about each input method,

<h3 class="section">22.5 Coding Systems</h3>

<p><a name="index-coding-systems-1839"></a>
  Users of various languages have established many more-or-less standard
coding systems for representing them.  Emacs does not use these coding
systems internally; instead, it converts from various coding systems to
its own system when reading data, and converts the internal coding
system to other coding systems when writing data.  Conversion is
possible in reading or writing files, in sending or receiving from the
terminal, and in exchanging data with subprocesses.

   <p>Emacs assigns a name to each coding system.  Most coding systems are
used for one language, and the name of the coding system starts with
the language name.  Some coding systems are used for several
languages; their names usually start with `<samp><span class="samp">iso</span></samp>'.  There are also
special coding systems, such as <code>no-conversion</code>, <code>raw-text</code>,
and <code>emacs-internal</code>.

   <p><a name="index-international-files-from-DOS_002fWindows-systems-1840"></a>  A special class of coding systems, collectively known as
<dfn>codepages</dfn>, is designed to support text encoded by MS-Windows and
MS-DOS software.  The names of these coding systems are
<code>cp</code><var>nnnn</var>, where <var>nnnn</var> is a 3- or 4-digit number of the
codepage.  You can use these encodings just like any other coding
system; for example, to visit a file encoded in codepage 850, type
<kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt; c cp850 &lt;RET&gt; C-x C-f </kbd><var>filename</var><kbd>
&lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.

   <p>In addition to converting various representations of non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym>
characters, a coding system can perform end-of-line conversion.  Emacs
handles three different conventions for how to separate lines in a file:
newline (Unix), carriage-return linefeed (DOS), and just
carriage-return (Mac).

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-h C </kbd><var>coding</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Describe coding system <var>coding</var> (<code>describe-coding-system</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x list-coding-systems</kbd><dd>Display a list of all the supported coding systems. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dh-C-1841"></a><a name="index-describe_002dcoding_002dsystem-1842"></a>  The command <kbd>C-h C</kbd> (<code>describe-coding-system</code>) displays
information about particular coding systems, including the end-of-line
conversion specified by those coding systems.  You can specify a coding
system name as the argument; alternatively, with an empty argument, it
describes the coding systems currently selected for various purposes,
both in the current buffer and as the defaults, and the priority list
for recognizing coding systems (see <a href="#Recognize-Coding">Recognize Coding</a>).

   <p><a name="index-list_002dcoding_002dsystems-1843"></a>  To display a list of all the supported coding systems, type <kbd>M-x
list-coding-systems</kbd>.  The list gives information about each coding
system, including the letter that stands for it in the mode line
(see <a href="#Mode-Line">Mode Line</a>).

   <p><a name="index-end_002dof_002dline-conversion-1844"></a><a name="index-line-endings-1845"></a><a name="index-MS_002dDOS-end_002dof_002dline-conversion-1846"></a><a name="index-Macintosh-end_002dof_002dline-conversion-1847"></a>  Each of the coding systems that appear in this list&mdash;except for
<code>no-conversion</code>, which means no conversion of any kind&mdash;specifies
how and whether to convert printing characters, but leaves the choice of
end-of-line conversion to be decided based on the contents of each file. 
For example, if the file appears to use the sequence carriage-return
linefeed to separate lines, DOS end-of-line conversion will be used.

   <p>Each of the listed coding systems has three variants, which specify
exactly what to do for end-of-line conversion:

     <dl>
<dt><code>...-unix</code><dd>Don't do any end-of-line conversion; assume the file uses
newline to separate lines.  (This is the convention normally used
on Unix and GNU systems, and Mac OS X.)

     <br><dt><code>...-dos</code><dd>Assume the file uses carriage-return linefeed to separate lines, and do
the appropriate conversion.  (This is the convention normally used on
Microsoft systems.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-8" name="fnd-8"><sup>8</sup></a>)

     <br><dt><code>...-mac</code><dd>Assume the file uses carriage-return to separate lines, and do the
appropriate conversion.  (This was the convention used on the
Macintosh system prior to OS X.) 
</dl>

   <p>These variant coding systems are omitted from the
<code>list-coding-systems</code> display for brevity, since they are entirely
predictable.  For example, the coding system <code>iso-latin-1</code> has
variants <code>iso-latin-1-unix</code>, <code>iso-latin-1-dos</code> and
<code>iso-latin-1-mac</code>.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bundecided_007d_002c-coding-system-1848"></a>  The coding systems <code>unix</code>, <code>dos</code>, and <code>mac</code> are
aliases for <code>undecided-unix</code>, <code>undecided-dos</code>, and
<code>undecided-mac</code>, respectively.  These coding systems specify only
the end-of-line conversion, and leave the character code conversion to
be deduced from the text itself.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007braw_002dtext_007d_002c-coding-system-1849"></a>  The coding system <code>raw-text</code> is good for a file which is mainly
<acronym>ASCII</acronym> text, but may contain byte values above 127 that are
not meant to encode non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters.  With
<code>raw-text</code>, Emacs copies those byte values unchanged, and sets
<code>enable-multibyte-characters</code> to <code>nil</code> in the current buffer
so that they will be interpreted properly.  <code>raw-text</code> handles
end-of-line conversion in the usual way, based on the data
encountered, and has the usual three variants to specify the kind of
end-of-line conversion to use.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bno_002dconversion_007d_002c-coding-system-1850"></a>  In contrast, the coding system <code>no-conversion</code> specifies no
character code conversion at all&mdash;none for non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> byte values and
none for end of line.  This is useful for reading or writing binary
files, tar files, and other files that must be examined verbatim.  It,
too, sets <code>enable-multibyte-characters</code> to <code>nil</code>.

   <p>The easiest way to edit a file with no conversion of any kind is with
the <kbd>M-x find-file-literally</kbd> command.  This uses
<code>no-conversion</code>, and also suppresses other Emacs features that
might convert the file contents before you see them.  See <a href="#Visiting">Visiting</a>.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bemacs_002dinternal_007d_002c-coding-system-1851"></a>  The coding system <code>emacs-internal</code> (or <code>utf-8-emacs</code>,
which is equivalent) means that the file contains non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym>
characters stored with the internal Emacs encoding.  This coding
system handles end-of-line conversion based on the data encountered,
and has the usual three variants to specify the kind of end-of-line
conversion.

<h3 class="section">22.6 Recognizing Coding Systems</h3>

<p>Whenever Emacs reads a given piece of text, it tries to recognize
which coding system to use.  This applies to files being read, output
from subprocesses, text from X selections, etc.  Emacs can select the
right coding system automatically most of the time&mdash;once you have
specified your preferences.

   <p>Some coding systems can be recognized or distinguished by which byte
sequences appear in the data.  However, there are coding systems that
cannot be distinguished, not even potentially.  For example, there is no
way to distinguish between Latin-1 and Latin-2; they use the same byte
values with different meanings.

   <p>Emacs handles this situation by means of a priority list of coding
systems.  Whenever Emacs reads a file, if you do not specify the coding
system to use, Emacs checks the data against each coding system,
starting with the first in priority and working down the list, until it
finds a coding system that fits the data.  Then it converts the file
contents assuming that they are represented in this coding system.

   <p>The priority list of coding systems depends on the selected language
environment (see <a href="#Language-Environments">Language Environments</a>).  For example, if you use
French, you probably want Emacs to prefer Latin-1 to Latin-2; if you use
Czech, you probably want Latin-2 to be preferred.  This is one of the
reasons to specify a language environment.

   <p><a name="index-prefer_002dcoding_002dsystem-1852"></a>  However, you can alter the coding system priority list in detail
with the command <kbd>M-x prefer-coding-system</kbd>.  This command reads
the name of a coding system from the minibuffer, and adds it to the
front of the priority list, so that it is preferred to all others.  If
you use this command several times, each use adds one element to the
front of the priority list.

   <p>If you use a coding system that specifies the end-of-line conversion
type, such as <code>iso-8859-1-dos</code>, what this means is that Emacs
should attempt to recognize <code>iso-8859-1</code> with priority, and should
use DOS end-of-line conversion when it does recognize <code>iso-8859-1</code>.

   <p><a name="index-file_002dcoding_002dsystem_002dalist-1853"></a>  Sometimes a file name indicates which coding system to use for the
file.  The variable <code>file-coding-system-alist</code> specifies this
correspondence.  There is a special function
<code>modify-coding-system-alist</code> for adding elements to this list.  For
example, to read and write all `<samp><span class="samp">.txt</span></samp>' files using the coding system
<code>chinese-iso-8bit</code>, you can execute this Lisp expression:

<pre class="smallexample">     (modify-coding-system-alist 'file "\\.txt\\'" 'chinese-iso-8bit)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The first argument should be <code>file</code>, the second argument should be
a regular expression that determines which files this applies to, and
the third argument says which coding system to use for these files.

   <p><a name="index-inhibit_002deol_002dconversion-1854"></a><a name="index-DOS_002dstyle-end_002dof_002dline-display-1855"></a>  Emacs recognizes which kind of end-of-line conversion to use based on
the contents of the file: if it sees only carriage-returns, or only
carriage-return linefeed sequences, then it chooses the end-of-line
conversion accordingly.  You can inhibit the automatic use of
end-of-line conversion by setting the variable <code>inhibit-eol-conversion</code>
to non-<code>nil</code>.  If you do that, DOS-style files will be displayed
with the `<samp><span class="samp">^M</span></samp>' characters visible in the buffer; some people
prefer this to the more subtle `<samp><span class="samp">(DOS)</span></samp>' end-of-line type
indication near the left edge of the mode line (see <a href="#Mode-Line">eol-mnemonic</a>).

   <p><a name="index-inhibit_002diso_002descape_002ddetection-1856"></a><a name="index-escape-sequences-in-files-1857"></a>  By default, the automatic detection of coding system is sensitive to
escape sequences.  If Emacs sees a sequence of characters that begin
with an escape character, and the sequence is valid as an ISO-2022
code, that tells Emacs to use one of the ISO-2022 encodings to decode
the file.

   <p>However, there may be cases that you want to read escape sequences
in a file as is.  In such a case, you can set the variable
<code>inhibit-iso-escape-detection</code> to non-<code>nil</code>.  Then the code
detection ignores any escape sequences, and never uses an ISO-2022
encoding.  The result is that all escape sequences become visible in
the buffer.

   <p>The default value of <code>inhibit-iso-escape-detection</code> is
<code>nil</code>.  We recommend that you not change it permanently, only for
one specific operation.  That's because some Emacs Lisp source files
in the Emacs distribution contain non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters encoded in the
coding system <code>iso-2022-7bit</code>, and they won't be
decoded correctly when you visit those files if you suppress the
escape sequence detection. 
<!-- I count a grand total of 3 such files, so is the above really true? -->

   <p><a name="index-auto_002dcoding_002dalist-1858"></a><a name="index-auto_002dcoding_002dregexp_002dalist-1859"></a>  The variables <code>auto-coding-alist</code> and
<code>auto-coding-regexp-alist</code> are
the strongest way to specify the coding system for certain patterns of
file names, or for files containing certain patterns, respectively. 
These variables even override `<samp><span class="samp">-*-coding:-*-</span></samp>' tags in the file
itself (see <a href="#Specify-Coding">Specify Coding</a>).  For example, Emacs
uses <code>auto-coding-alist</code> for tar and archive files, to prevent it
from being confused by a `<samp><span class="samp">-*-coding:-*-</span></samp>' tag in a member of the
archive and thinking it applies to the archive file as a whole.

   <p><a name="index-auto_002dcoding_002dfunctions-1860"></a>  Another way to specify a coding system is with the variable
<code>auto-coding-functions</code>.  For example, one of the builtin
<code>auto-coding-functions</code> detects the encoding for XML files. 
Unlike the previous two, this variable does not override any
`<samp><span class="samp">-*-coding:-*-</span></samp>' tag.

<h3 class="section">22.7 Specifying a File's Coding System</h3>

<p>If Emacs recognizes the encoding of a file incorrectly, you can
reread the file using the correct coding system with <kbd>C-x
&lt;RET&gt; r</kbd> (<code>revert-buffer-with-coding-system</code>).  This command
prompts for the coding system to use.  To see what coding system Emacs
actually used to decode the file, look at the coding system mnemonic
letter near the left edge of the mode line (see <a href="#Mode-Line">Mode Line</a>), or
type <kbd>C-h C</kbd> (<code>describe-coding-system</code>).

   <p><a name="index-coding-1861"></a>  You can specify the coding system for a particular file in the file
itself, using the `<samp><span class="samp">-*-...-*-</span></samp>'<!-- /@w --> construct at the beginning,
or a local variables list at the end (see <a href="#File-Variables">File Variables</a>).  You do
this by defining a value for the &ldquo;variable&rdquo; named <code>coding</code>. 
Emacs does not really have a variable <code>coding</code>; instead of
setting a variable, this uses the specified coding system for the
file.  For example, `<samp><span class="samp">-*-mode: C; coding: latin-1;-*-</span></samp>' specifies
use of the Latin-1 coding system, as well as C mode.  When you specify
the coding explicitly in the file, that overrides
<code>file-coding-system-alist</code>.

<h3 class="section">22.8 Choosing Coding Systems for Output</h3>

<p><a name="index-buffer_002dfile_002dcoding_002dsystem-1862"></a>  Once Emacs has chosen a coding system for a buffer, it stores that
coding system in <code>buffer-file-coding-system</code>.  That makes it the
default for operations that write from this buffer into a file, such
as <code>save-buffer</code> and <code>write-region</code>.  You can specify a
different coding system for further file output from the buffer using
<code>set-buffer-file-coding-system</code> (see <a href="#Text-Coding">Text Coding</a>).

   <p>You can insert any character Emacs supports into any Emacs buffer,
but most coding systems can only handle a subset of these characters. 
Therefore, it's possible that the characters you insert cannot be
encoded with the coding system that will be used to save the buffer. 
For example, you could visit a text file in Polish, encoded in
<code>iso-8859-2</code>, and add some Russian words to it.  When you save
that buffer, Emacs cannot use the current value of
<code>buffer-file-coding-system</code>, because the characters you added
cannot be encoded by that coding system.

   <p>When that happens, Emacs tries the most-preferred coding system (set
by <kbd>M-x prefer-coding-system</kbd> or <kbd>M-x
set-language-environment</kbd>).  If that coding system can safely encode
all of the characters in the buffer, Emacs uses it, and stores its
value in <code>buffer-file-coding-system</code>.  Otherwise, Emacs displays
a list of coding systems suitable for encoding the buffer's contents,
and asks you to choose one of those coding systems.

   <p>If you insert the unsuitable characters in a mail message, Emacs
behaves a bit differently.  It additionally checks whether the
<!-- What determines this? -->
most-preferred coding system is recommended for use in MIME messages;
if not, it informs you of this fact and prompts you for another coding
system.  This is so you won't inadvertently send a message encoded in
a way that your recipient's mail software will have difficulty
decoding.  (You can still use an unsuitable coding system if you enter
its name at the prompt.)

<!-- It seems that select-message-coding-system does this. -->
<!-- Both sendmail.el and smptmail.el call it; i.e., smtpmail.el still -->
<!-- obeys sendmail-coding-system. -->
<p><a name="index-sendmail_002dcoding_002dsystem-1863"></a>  When you send a mail message (see <a href="#Sending-Mail">Sending Mail</a>),
Emacs has four different ways to determine the coding system to use
for encoding the message text.  It tries the buffer's own value of
<code>buffer-file-coding-system</code>, if that is non-<code>nil</code>. 
Otherwise, it uses the value of <code>sendmail-coding-system</code>, if that
is non-<code>nil</code>.  The third way is to use the default coding system
for new files, which is controlled by your choice of language
<!-- i.e., default-sendmail-coding-system -->
environment, if that is non-<code>nil</code>.  If all of these three values
are <code>nil</code>, Emacs encodes outgoing mail using the Latin-1 coding
system. 
<!-- FIXME?  Where does the Latin-1 default come in? -->

<h3 class="section">22.9 Specifying a Coding System for File Text</h3>

<p>In cases where Emacs does not automatically choose the right coding
system for a file's contents, you can use these commands to specify
one:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt; f </kbd><var>coding</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Use coding system <var>coding</var> to save or revisit the file in
the current buffer (<code>set-buffer-file-coding-system</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt; c </kbd><var>coding</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Specify coding system <var>coding</var> for the immediately following
command (<code>universal-coding-system-argument</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt; r </kbd><var>coding</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Revisit the current file using the coding system <var>coding</var>
(<code>revert-buffer-with-coding-system</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x recode-region &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>right</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>wrong</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Convert a region that was decoded using coding system <var>wrong</var>,
decoding it using coding system <var>right</var> instead. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-RET-f-1864"></a><a name="index-set_002dbuffer_002dfile_002dcoding_002dsystem-1865"></a>  The command <kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt; f</kbd>
(<code>set-buffer-file-coding-system</code>) sets the file coding system for
the current buffer (i.e., the coding system to use when saving or
reverting the file).  You specify which coding system using the
minibuffer.  You can also invoke this command by clicking with
<kbd>mouse-3</kbd> on the coding system indicator in the mode line
(see <a href="#Mode-Line">Mode Line</a>).

   <p>If you specify a coding system that cannot handle all the characters
in the buffer, Emacs will warn you about the troublesome characters,
and ask you to choose another coding system, when you try to save the
buffer (see <a href="#Output-Coding">Output Coding</a>).

   <p><a name="index-specify-end_002dof_002dline-conversion-1866"></a>  You can also use this command to specify the end-of-line conversion
(see <a href="#Coding-Systems">end-of-line conversion</a>) for encoding the
current buffer.  For example, <kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt; f dos &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> will
cause Emacs to save the current buffer's text with DOS-style
carriage-return linefeed line endings.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-RET-c-1867"></a><a name="index-universal_002dcoding_002dsystem_002dargument-1868"></a>  Another way to specify the coding system for a file is when you visit
the file.  First use the command <kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt; c</kbd>
(<code>universal-coding-system-argument</code>); this command uses the
minibuffer to read a coding system name.  After you exit the minibuffer,
the specified coding system is used for <em>the immediately following
command</em>.

   <p>So if the immediately following command is <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>, for example,
it reads the file using that coding system (and records the coding
system for when you later save the file).  Or if the immediately following
command is <kbd>C-x C-w</kbd>, it writes the file using that coding system. 
When you specify the coding system for saving in this way, instead
of with <kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt; f</kbd>, there is no warning if the buffer
contains characters that the coding system cannot handle.

   <p>Other file commands affected by a specified coding system include
<kbd>C-x i</kbd> and <kbd>C-x C-v</kbd>, as well as the other-window variants
of <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>.  <kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt; c</kbd> also affects commands that
start subprocesses, including <kbd>M-x shell</kbd> (see <a href="#Shell">Shell</a>).  If the
immediately following command does not use the coding system, then
<kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt; c</kbd> ultimately has no effect.

   <p>An easy way to visit a file with no conversion is with the <kbd>M-x
find-file-literally</kbd> command.  See <a href="#Visiting">Visiting</a>.

   <p>The default value of the variable <code>buffer-file-coding-system</code>
specifies the choice of coding system to use when you create a new file. 
It applies when you find a new file, and when you create a buffer and
then save it in a file.  Selecting a language environment typically sets
this variable to a good choice of default coding system for that language
environment.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-RET-r-1869"></a><a name="index-revert_002dbuffer_002dwith_002dcoding_002dsystem-1870"></a>  If you visit a file with a wrong coding system, you can correct this
with <kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt; r</kbd> (<code>revert-buffer-with-coding-system</code>). 
This visits the current file again, using a coding system you specify.

   <p><a name="index-recode_002dregion-1871"></a>  If a piece of text has already been inserted into a buffer using the
wrong coding system, you can redo the decoding of it using <kbd>M-x
recode-region</kbd>.  This prompts you for the proper coding system, then
for the wrong coding system that was actually used, and does the
conversion.  It first encodes the region using the wrong coding system,
then decodes it again using the proper coding system.

specifies the coding system for sending selected text to other windowing
applications, and for receiving the text of selections made in other
applications.  This command applies to all subsequent selections, until
you override it by using the command again.  The command <kbd>C-x
&lt;RET&gt; X</kbd> (<code>set-next-selection-coding-system</code>) specifies the
coding system for the next selection made in Emacs or read by Emacs.

   <p><a name="index-x_002dselect_002drequest_002dtype-1876"></a>  The variable <code>x-select-request-type</code> specifies the data type to
request from the X Window System for receiving text selections from
other applications.  If the value is <code>nil</code> (the default), Emacs
tries <code>UTF8_STRING</code> and <code>COMPOUND_TEXT</code>, in this order, and
uses various heuristics to choose the more appropriate of the two
results; if none of these succeed, Emacs falls back on <code>STRING</code>. 
If the value of <code>x-select-request-type</code> is one of the symbols
<code>COMPOUND_TEXT</code>, <code>UTF8_STRING</code>, <code>STRING</code>, or
<code>TEXT</code>, Emacs uses only that request type.  If the value is a
list of some of these symbols, Emacs tries only the request types in
the list, in order, until one of them succeeds, or until the list is
exhausted.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-RET-p-1877"></a><a name="index-set_002dbuffer_002dprocess_002dcoding_002dsystem-1878"></a>  The command <kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt; p</kbd> (<code>set-buffer-process-coding-system</code>)
specifies the coding system for input and output to a subprocess.  This
command applies to the current buffer; normally, each subprocess has its
own buffer, and thus you can use this command to specify translation to
and from a particular subprocess by giving the command in the
corresponding buffer.

   <p>You can also use <kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt; c</kbd>
(<code>universal-coding-system-argument</code>) just before the command that
runs or starts a subprocess, to specify the coding system for
communicating with that subprocess.  See <a href="#Text-Coding">Text Coding</a>.

   <p>The default for translation of process input and output depends on the
current language environment.

to use when encoding and decoding system strings such as system error
messages and <code>format-time-string</code> formats and time stamps.  That
coding system is also used for decoding non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> keyboard
input on the X Window System and for encoding text sent to the
standard output and error streams when in batch mode.  You should
choose a coding system that is compatible
with the underlying system's text representation, which is normally
specified by one of the environment variables <samp><span class="env">LC_ALL</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="env">LC_CTYPE</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="env">LANG</span></samp>.  (The first one, in the order

specifies a coding system to use for encoding file <em>names</em>.  It
has no effect on reading and writing the <em>contents</em> of files.

   <p><a name="index-file_002dname_002dcoding_002dsystem-1884"></a>  In fact, all this command does is set the value of the variable
<code>file-name-coding-system</code>.  If you set the variable to a coding
system name (as a Lisp symbol or a string), Emacs encodes file names
using that coding system for all file operations.  This makes it
possible to use non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters in file names&mdash;or, at
least, those non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters that the specified coding
system can encode.

   <p>If <code>file-name-coding-system</code> is <code>nil</code>, Emacs uses a
default coding system determined by the selected language environment,
and stored in the <code>default-file-name-coding-system</code> variable. 
<!-- FIXME?  Is this correct?  What is the "default language environment"? -->
In the default language environment, non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters in
file names are not encoded specially; they appear in the file system
using the internal Emacs representation.

   <p><a name="index-file_002dname-encoding_002c-MS_002dWindows-1885"></a><a name="index-w32_002dunicode_002dfilenames-1886"></a>  When Emacs runs on MS-Windows versions that are descendants of the
NT family (Windows 2000, XP, Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8), the
value of <code>file-name-coding-system</code> is largely ignored, as Emacs
by default uses APIs that allow passing Unicode file names directly. 
By contrast, on Windows 9X, file names are encoded using
<code>file-name-coding-system</code>, which should be set to the codepage
(see <a href="#Coding-Systems">codepage</a>) pertinent for the current system
locale.  The value of the variable <code>w32-unicode-filenames</code>
controls whether Emacs uses the Unicode APIs when it calls OS
functions that accept file names.  This variable is set by the startup
code to <code>nil</code> on Windows 9X, and to <code>t</code> on newer versions of
MS-Windows.

   <p><strong>Warning:</strong> if you change <code>file-name-coding-system</code> (or the
language environment) in the middle of an Emacs session, problems can
result if you have already visited files whose names were encoded using
the earlier coding system and cannot be encoded (or are encoded
differently) under the new coding system.  If you try to save one of
these buffers under the visited file name, saving may use the wrong file
name, or it may encounter an error.  If such a problem happens, use <kbd>C-x
C-w</kbd> to specify a new file name for that buffer.

   <p><a name="index-recode_002dfile_002dname-1887"></a>  If a mistake occurs when encoding a file name, use the command
<kbd>M-x recode-file-name</kbd> to change the file name's coding
system.  This prompts for an existing file name, its old coding
system, and the coding system to which you wish to convert.

terminals that support one of the ISO Latin character sets.  You need to

Emacs knows which characters the terminal can actually handle.

   <p>By default, output to the terminal is not translated at all, unless
Emacs can deduce the proper coding system from your terminal type or
your locale specification (see <a href="#Language-Environments">Language Environments</a>).

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-RET-k-1890"></a><a name="index-set_002dkeyboard_002dcoding_002dsystem-1891"></a><a name="index-keyboard_002dcoding_002dsystem-1892"></a>  The command <kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt; k</kbd> (<code>set-keyboard-coding-system</code>),
or the variable <code>keyboard-coding-system</code>, specifies the coding
system for keyboard input.  Character-code translation of keyboard
input is useful for terminals with keys that send non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym>
graphic characters&mdash;for example, some terminals designed for ISO
Latin-1 or subsets of it.

   <p>By default, keyboard input is translated based on your system locale
setting.  If your terminal does not really support the encoding
implied by your locale (for example, if you find it inserts a
non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> character if you type <kbd>M-i</kbd>), you will need to set
<code>keyboard-coding-system</code> to <code>nil</code> to turn off encoding. 
You can do this by putting

<pre class="lisp">     (set-keyboard-coding-system nil)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">in your init file.

   <p>There is a similarity between using a coding system translation for
keyboard input, and using an input method: both define sequences of
keyboard input that translate into single characters.  However, input
methods are designed to be convenient for interactive use by humans, and
the sequences that are translated are typically sequences of <acronym>ASCII</acronym>
printing characters.  Coding systems typically translate sequences of
non-graphic characters.

<h3 class="section">22.13 Fontsets</h3>

<p><a name="index-fontsets-1893"></a>
  A font typically defines shapes for a single alphabet or script. 
Therefore, displaying the entire range of scripts that Emacs supports
requires a collection of many fonts.  In Emacs, such a collection is
called a <dfn>fontset</dfn>.  A fontset is defined by a list of font specifications,
each assigned to handle a range of character codes, and may fall back
on another fontset for characters that are not covered by the fonts
it specifies.

   <p><a name="index-fonts-for-various-scripts-1894"></a><a name="index-Intlfonts-package_002c-installation-1895"></a>  Each fontset has a name, like a font.  However, while fonts are
stored in the system and the available font names are defined by the
system, fontsets are defined within Emacs itself.  Once you have
defined a fontset, you can use it within Emacs by specifying its name,
anywhere that you could use a single font.  Of course, Emacs fontsets
can use only the fonts that the system supports.  If some characters
appear on the screen as empty boxes or hex codes, this means that the
fontset in use for them has no font for those characters.  In this
case, or if the characters are shown, but not as well as you would
like, you may need to install extra fonts.  Your operating system may
have optional fonts that you can install; or you can install the GNU
Intlfonts package, which includes fonts for most supported
scripts.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-9" name="fnd-9"><sup>9</sup></a>

   <p>Emacs creates three fontsets automatically: the <dfn>standard
fontset</dfn>, the <dfn>startup fontset</dfn> and the <dfn>default fontset</dfn>. 
<!-- FIXME?  The doc of *standard*-fontset-spec says: -->
<!-- "You have the biggest chance to display international characters -->
<!-- with correct glyphs by using the *standard* fontset." (my emphasis) -->
<!-- See http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2012-04/msg00430.html -->
The default fontset is most likely to have fonts for a wide variety of
non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters, and is the default fallback for the
other two fontsets, and if you set a default font rather than fontset. 
However, it does not specify font family names, so results can be
somewhat random if you use it directly.  You can specify use of a
particular fontset by starting Emacs with the `<samp><span class="samp">-fn</span></samp>' option. 
For example,

<pre class="example">     emacs -fn fontset-standard
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You can also specify a fontset with the `<samp><span class="samp">Font</span></samp>' resource (see <a href="#X-Resources">X Resources</a>).

   <p>If no fontset is specified for use, then Emacs uses an
<acronym>ASCII</acronym> font, with `<samp><span class="samp">fontset-default</span></samp>' as a fallback for
characters the font does not cover.  The standard fontset is only used if
explicitly requested, despite its name.

   <p>A fontset does not necessarily specify a font for every character
code.  If a fontset specifies no font for a certain character, or if
it specifies a font that does not exist on your system, then it cannot
display that character properly.  It will display that character as a
hex code or thin space or an empty box instead.  (See <a href="#Text-Display">glyphless characters</a>, for details.)

<h3 class="section">22.14 Defining fontsets</h3>

<p><a name="index-standard_002dfontset_002dspec-1896"></a><a name="index-w32_002dstandard_002dfontset_002dspec-1897"></a><a name="index-ns_002dstandard_002dfontset_002dspec-1898"></a><a name="index-standard-fontset-1899"></a>  When running on X, Emacs creates a standard fontset automatically according to the value
of <code>standard-fontset-spec</code>.  This fontset's name is

<pre class="example">     -*-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-16-*-*-*-*-*-fontset-standard
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">or just `<samp><span class="samp">fontset-standard</span></samp>' for short.

   <p>On GNUstep and Mac OS X, the standard fontset is created using the value of
<code>ns-standard-fontset-spec</code>, and on MS Windows it is
created using the value of <code>w32-standard-fontset-spec</code>.

<!-- FIXME?  How does one access these, or do anything with them? -->
<!-- Does it matter? -->
<p>Bold, italic, and bold-italic variants of the standard fontset are
created automatically.  Their names have `<samp><span class="samp">bold</span></samp>' instead of
`<samp><span class="samp">medium</span></samp>', or `<samp><span class="samp">i</span></samp>' instead of `<samp><span class="samp">r</span></samp>', or both.

   <p><a name="index-startup-fontset-1900"></a>  Emacs generates a fontset automatically, based on any default
<acronym>ASCII</acronym> font that you specify with the `<samp><span class="samp">Font</span></samp>' resource or
the `<samp><span class="samp">-fn</span></samp>' argument, or the default font that Emacs found when it
started.  This is the <dfn>startup fontset</dfn> and its name is
<code>fontset-startup</code>.  It does this by replacing the
<var>charset_registry</var> field with `<samp><span class="samp">fontset</span></samp>', and replacing
<var>charset_encoding</var> field with `<samp><span class="samp">startup</span></samp>', then using the
resulting string to specify a fontset.

   <p>For instance, if you start Emacs with a font of this form,

<!-- FIXME?  I think this is a little misleading, because you cannot (?) -->
<!-- actually specify a font with wildcards, it has to be a complete spec. -->
<!-- Also, an X font specification of this form hasn't (?) been -->
<!-- mentioned before now, and is somewhat obsolete these days. -->
<!-- People are more likely to use a form like -->
<!-- emacs -fn "DejaVu Sans Mono-12" -->
<!-- How does any of this apply in that case? -->
<pre class="example">     emacs -fn "*courier-medium-r-normal--14-140-*-iso8859-1"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Emacs generates the following fontset and uses it for the initial X
window frame:

<pre class="example">     -*-courier-medium-r-normal-*-14-140-*-*-*-*-fontset-startup
</pre>
   <p>The startup fontset will use the font that you specify, or a variant
with a different registry and encoding, for all the characters that
are supported by that font, and fallback on `<samp><span class="samp">fontset-default</span></samp>' for
other characters.

   <p>With the X resource `<samp><span class="samp">Emacs.Font</span></samp>', you can specify a fontset name
just like an actual font name.  But be careful not to specify a fontset
name in a wildcard resource like `<samp><span class="samp">Emacs*Font</span></samp>'&mdash;that wildcard
specification matches various other resources, such as for menus, and
<!-- FIXME is this still true? -->
menus cannot handle fontsets.  See <a href="#X-Resources">X Resources</a>.

   <p>You can specify additional fontsets using X resources named
`<samp><span class="samp">Fontset-</span><var>n</var></samp>', where <var>n</var> is an integer starting from 0. 
The resource value should have this form:

<pre class="smallexample">     <var>fontpattern</var>, <span class="roman">[</span><var>charset</var>:<var>font</var><span class="roman">]...</span>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><var>fontpattern</var> should have the form of a standard X font name (see
the previous fontset-startup example), except
for the last two fields.  They should have the form
`<samp><span class="samp">fontset-</span><var>alias</var></samp>'.

   <p>The fontset has two names, one long and one short.  The long name is
<var>fontpattern</var>.  The short name is `<samp><span class="samp">fontset-</span><var>alias</var></samp>'.  You
can refer to the fontset by either name.

   <p>The construct `<samp><var>charset</var><span class="samp">:</span><var>font</var></samp>' specifies which font to
use (in this fontset) for one particular character set.  Here,
<var>charset</var> is the name of a character set, and <var>font</var> is the
font to use for that character set.  You can use this construct any
number of times in defining one fontset.

   <p>For the other character sets, Emacs chooses a font based on
<var>fontpattern</var>.  It replaces `<samp><span class="samp">fontset-</span><var>alias</var></samp>' with values
that describe the character set.  For the <acronym>ASCII</acronym> character font,
`<samp><span class="samp">fontset-</span><var>alias</var></samp>' is replaced with `<samp><span class="samp">ISO8859-1</span></samp>'.

   <p>In addition, when several consecutive fields are wildcards, Emacs
collapses them into a single wildcard.  This is to prevent use of
auto-scaled fonts.  Fonts made by scaling larger fonts are not usable
for editing, and scaling a smaller font is not also useful, because it is
better to use the smaller font in its own size, which is what Emacs
does.

   <p>Thus if <var>fontpattern</var> is this,

<pre class="example">     -*-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-24-*-*-*-*-*-fontset-24
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">the font specification for <acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters would be this:

<pre class="example">     -*-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-24-*-ISO8859-1
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and the font specification for Chinese GB2312 characters would be this:

<pre class="example">     -*-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-24-*-gb2312*-*
</pre>
   <p>You may not have any Chinese font matching the above font
specification.  Most X distributions include only Chinese fonts that
have `<samp><span class="samp">song ti</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">fangsong ti</span></samp>' in the <var>family</var> field.  In
such a case, `<samp><span class="samp">Fontset-</span><var>n</var></samp>' can be specified as:

<pre class="smallexample">     Emacs.Fontset-0: -*-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-24-*-*-*-*-*-fontset-24,\
             chinese-gb2312:-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-24-*-gb2312*-*
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Then, the font specifications for all but Chinese GB2312 characters have
`<samp><span class="samp">fixed</span></samp>' in the <var>family</var> field, and the font specification for
Chinese GB2312 characters has a wild card `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' in the <var>family</var>
field.

   <p><a name="index-create_002dfontset_002dfrom_002dfontset_002dspec-1901"></a>  The function that processes the fontset resource value to create the
fontset is called <code>create-fontset-from-fontset-spec</code>.  You can also
call this function explicitly to create a fontset.

<h3 class="section">22.15 Modifying Fontsets</h3>

<p><a name="index-fontsets_002c-modifying-1902"></a><a name="index-set_002dfontset_002dfont-1903"></a>
  Fontsets do not always have to be created from scratch.  If only
minor changes are required it may be easier to modify an existing
fontset.  Modifying `<samp><span class="samp">fontset-default</span></samp>' will also affect other
fontsets that use it as a fallback, so can be an effective way of
fixing problems with the fonts that Emacs chooses for a particular
script.

   <p>Fontsets can be modified using the function <code>set-fontset-font</code>,
specifying a character, a charset, a script, or a range of characters
to modify the font for, and a font specification for the font to be
used.  Some examples are:

<pre class="example">     ;; Use Liberation Mono for latin-3 charset.
     (set-fontset-font "fontset-default" 'iso-8859-3
                       "Liberation Mono")
     
     ;; Prefer a big5 font for han characters
     (set-fontset-font "fontset-default"
                       'han (font-spec :registry "big5")
                       nil 'prepend)
     
     ;; Use DejaVu Sans Mono as a fallback in fontset-startup
     ;; before resorting to fontset-default.
     (set-fontset-font "fontset-startup" nil "DejaVu Sans Mono"
                       nil 'append)
     
     ;; Use MyPrivateFont for the Unicode private use area.
     (set-fontset-font "fontset-default"  '(#xe000 . #xf8ff)
                       "MyPrivateFont")

unpleasant results for characters for which they are used, and you may
wish to instruct Emacs to completely ignore them while searching for a
suitable font required to display a character.  You can do that by
adding the offending fonts to the value of <code>face-ignored-fonts</code>
variable, which is a list.  Here's an example to put in your
<samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp>:

<h3 class="section">22.16 Undisplayable Characters</h3>

<p>There may be some non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters that your
terminal cannot display.  Most text terminals support just a single
character set (use the variable <code>default-terminal-coding-system</code>
to tell Emacs which one, <a href="#Terminal-Coding">Terminal Coding</a>); characters that
can't be encoded in that coding system are displayed as `<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>' by
default.

   <p>Graphical displays can display a broader range of characters, but
you may not have fonts installed for all of them; characters that have
no font appear as a hollow box.

   <p>If you use Latin-1 characters but your terminal can't display
Latin-1, you can arrange to display mnemonic <acronym>ASCII</acronym> sequences
instead, e.g., `<samp><span class="samp">"o</span></samp>' for o-umlaut.  Load the library
<samp><span class="file">iso-ascii</span></samp> to do this.

   <p><a name="index-latin1_002ddisplay-1907"></a>  If your terminal can display Latin-1, you can display characters
from other European character sets using a mixture of equivalent
Latin-1 characters and <acronym>ASCII</acronym> mnemonics.  Customize the variable
<code>latin1-display</code> to enable this.  The mnemonic <acronym>ASCII</acronym>
sequences mostly correspond to those of the prefix input methods.

the range 0240 to 0377 octal (160 to 255 decimal) to handle the
accented letters and punctuation needed by various European languages
(and some non-European ones).  Note that Emacs considers bytes with
codes in this range as raw bytes, not as characters, even in a unibyte
buffer, i.e., if you disable multibyte characters.  However, Emacs can
still handle these character codes as if they belonged to <em>one</em>
of the single-byte character sets at a time.  To specify <em>which</em>
of these codes to use, invoke <kbd>M-x set-language-environment</kbd> and
specify a suitable language environment such as `<samp><span class="samp">Latin-</span><var>n</var></samp>'. 
See <a href="elisp.html#Disabling-Multibyte">Disabling Multibyte Characters</a>.

   <p><a name="index-unibyte_002ddisplay_002dvia_002dlanguage_002denvironment-1912"></a>  Emacs can also display bytes in the range 160 to 255 as readable
characters, provided the terminal or font in use supports them.  This
works automatically.  On a graphical display, Emacs can also display
single-byte characters through fontsets, in effect by displaying the
equivalent multibyte characters according to the current language
environment.  To request this, set the variable
<code>unibyte-display-via-language-environment</code> to a non-<code>nil</code>
value.  Note that setting this only affects how these bytes are
displayed, but does not change the fundamental fact that Emacs treats
them as raw bytes, not as characters.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007biso_002dascii_007d-library-1913"></a>  If your terminal does not support display of the Latin-1 character
set, Emacs can display these characters as <acronym>ASCII</acronym> sequences which at
least give you a clear idea of what the characters are.  To do this,
load the library <code>iso-ascii</code>.  Similar libraries for other
Latin-<var>n</var> character sets could be implemented, but have not been
so far.

   <p><a name="index-standard_002ddisplay_002d8bit-1914"></a><a name="index-g_t8_002dbit-display-1915"></a>  Normally non-ISO-8859 characters (decimal codes between 128 and 159
inclusive) are displayed as octal escapes.  You can change this for
non-standard extended versions of ISO-8859 character sets by using the
function <code>standard-display-8bit</code> in the <code>disp-table</code> library.

   <p>There are two ways to input single-byte non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym>
characters:

     
<a name="index-g_t8_002dbit-input-1916"></a>
<ul><li>You can use an input method for the selected language environment. 
See <a href="#Input-Methods">Input Methods</a>.  When you use an input method in a unibyte buffer,
the non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> character you specify with it is converted to unibyte.

     <li>If your keyboard can generate character codes 128 (decimal) and up,
representing non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters, you can type those character codes
directly.

     <p>On a graphical display, you should not need to do anything special to
use these keys; they should simply work.  On a text terminal, you
should use the command <code>M-x set-keyboard-coding-system</code> or customize the
variable <code>keyboard-coding-system</code> to specify which coding system
your keyboard uses (see <a href="#Terminal-Coding">Terminal Coding</a>).  Enabling this feature
will probably require you to use &lt;ESC&gt; to type Meta characters;
however, on a console terminal or in <code>xterm</code>, you can arrange for
Meta to be converted to &lt;ESC&gt; and still be able type 8-bit
characters present directly on the keyboard or using &lt;Compose&gt; or
&lt;AltGr&gt; keys.  See <a href="#User-Input">User Input</a>.

     <p><a name="index-C_002dx-8-1917"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007biso_002dtransl_007d-library-1918"></a><a name="index-compose-character-1919"></a><a name="index-dead-character-1920"></a><li>You can use the key <kbd>C-x 8</kbd> as a compose-character prefix for
entry of non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> Latin-1 and a few other printing
characters.  <kbd>C-x 8</kbd> is good for insertion (in the minibuffer as
well as other buffers), for searching, and in any other context where
a key sequence is allowed.

     <p><kbd>C-x 8</kbd> works by loading the <code>iso-transl</code> library.  Once that
library is loaded, the &lt;Alt&gt; modifier key, if the keyboard has
one, serves the same purpose as <kbd>C-x 8</kbd>: use &lt;Alt&gt; together
with an accent character to modify the following letter.  In addition,
if the keyboard has keys for the Latin-1 dead accent characters,
they too are defined to compose with the following character, once
<code>iso-transl</code> is loaded.

     <p>Use <kbd>C-x 8 C-h</kbd> to list all the available <kbd>C-x 8</kbd> translations.

<h3 class="section">22.18 Charsets</h3>

<p><a name="index-charsets-1921"></a>
  In Emacs, <dfn>charset</dfn> is short for &ldquo;character set&rdquo;.  Emacs
supports most popular charsets (such as <code>ascii</code>,
<code>iso-8859-1</code>, <code>cp1250</code>, <code>big5</code>, and <code>unicode</code>), in
addition to some charsets of its own (such as <code>emacs</code>,
<code>unicode-bmp</code>, and <code>eight-bit</code>).  All supported characters
belong to one or more charsets.

   <p>Emacs normally does the right thing with respect to charsets, so
that you don't have to worry about them.  However, it is sometimes
helpful to know some of the underlying details about charsets.

   <p>One example is font selection (see <a href="#Fonts">Fonts</a>).  Each language
environment (see <a href="#Language-Environments">Language Environments</a>) defines a priority
list for the various charsets.  When searching for a font, Emacs
initially attempts to find one that can display the highest-priority
charsets.  For instance, in the Japanese language environment, the
charset <code>japanese-jisx0208</code> has the highest priority, so Emacs
tries to use a font whose <code>registry</code> property is
`<samp><span class="samp">JISX0208.1983-0</span></samp>'.

   <p><a name="index-list_002dcharset_002dchars-1922"></a><a name="index-characters-in-a-certain-charset-1923"></a><a name="index-describe_002dcharacter_002dset-1924"></a>  There are two commands that can be used to obtain information about
charsets.  The command <kbd>M-x list-charset-chars</kbd> prompts for a
charset name, and displays all the characters in that character set. 
The command <kbd>M-x describe-character-set</kbd> prompts for a charset
name, and displays information about that charset, including its
internal representation within Emacs.

   <p><a name="index-list_002dcharacter_002dsets-1925"></a>  <kbd>M-x list-character-sets</kbd> displays a list of all supported
charsets.  The list gives the names of charsets and additional
information to identity each charset; for more details, see the
<a href="https://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/itscj_english/iso-ir/ISO-IR.pdf">ISO International Register of Coded Character Sets to be Used with Escape Sequences (ISO-IR)</a> maintained by
the <a href="https://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/itscj_english/">Information Processing Society of Japan/Information Technology Standards Commission of Japan (IPSJ/ITSCJ)</a>.  In this list,
charsets are divided into two categories: <dfn>normal charsets</dfn> are
listed first, followed by <dfn>supplementary charsets</dfn>.  A
supplementary charset is one that is used to define another charset
(as a parent or a subset), or to provide backward-compatibility for
older Emacs versions.

   <p>To find out which charset a character in the buffer belongs to, put

<h3 class="section">22.19 Bidirectional Editing</h3>

<p><a name="index-bidirectional-editing-1926"></a><a name="index-right_002dto_002dleft-text-1927"></a>
  Emacs supports editing text written in scripts, such as Arabic and
Hebrew, whose natural ordering of horizontal text for display is from
right to left.  However, digits and Latin text embedded in these
scripts are still displayed left to right.  It is also not uncommon to
have small portions of text in Arabic or Hebrew embedded in an otherwise
Latin document; e.g., as comments and strings in a program source
file.  For these reasons, text that uses these scripts is actually
<dfn>bidirectional</dfn>: a mixture of runs of left-to-right and
right-to-left characters.

   <p>This section describes the facilities and options provided by Emacs
for editing bidirectional text.

   <p><a name="index-logical-order-1928"></a><a name="index-visual-order-1929"></a>  Emacs stores right-to-left and bidirectional text in the so-called
<dfn>logical</dfn> (or <dfn>reading</dfn>) order: the buffer or string position
of the first character you read precedes that of the next character. 
Reordering of bidirectional text into the <dfn>visual</dfn> order happens
at display time.  As result, character positions no longer increase
monotonically with their positions on display.  Emacs implements the
Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm described in the Unicode Standard
Annex #9, for reordering of bidirectional text for display.

   <p><a name="index-bidi_002ddisplay_002dreordering-1930"></a>  The buffer-local variable <code>bidi-display-reordering</code> controls
whether text in the buffer is reordered for display.  If its value is
non-<code>nil</code>, Emacs reorders characters that have right-to-left
directionality when they are displayed.  The default value is
<code>t</code>.

   <p><a name="index-base-direction-of-paragraphs-1931"></a><a name="index-paragraph_002c-base-direction-1932"></a>  Each paragraph of bidirectional text can have its own <dfn>base
direction</dfn>, either right-to-left or left-to-right.  (Paragraph
<!-- paragraph-separate etc have no influence on this? -->
boundaries are empty lines, i.e., lines consisting entirely of
whitespace characters.)  Text in left-to-right paragraphs begins on
the screen at the left margin of the window and is truncated or
continued when it reaches the right margin.  By contrast, text in
right-to-left paragraphs is displayed starting at the right margin and
is continued or truncated at the left margin.

   <p><a name="index-bidi_002dparagraph_002ddirection-1933"></a>  Emacs determines the base direction of each paragraph dynamically,
based on the text at the beginning of the paragraph.  However,
sometimes a buffer may need to force a certain base direction for its
paragraphs.  The variable <code>bidi-paragraph-direction</code>, if
non-<code>nil</code>, disables the dynamic determination of the base
direction, and instead forces all paragraphs in the buffer to have the
direction specified by its buffer-local value.  The value can be either
<code>right-to-left</code> or <code>left-to-right</code>.  Any other value is
interpreted as <code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-LRM-1934"></a><a name="index-RLM-1935"></a>  Alternatively, you can control the base direction of a paragraph by
inserting special formatting characters in front of the paragraph. 
The special character <code>RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK</code>, or <span class="sc">rlm</span>, forces
the right-to-left direction on the following paragraph, while
<code>LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK</code>, or <span class="sc">lrm</span> forces the left-to-right
direction.  (You can use <kbd>C-x 8 &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> to insert these characters.) 
In a GUI session, the <span class="sc">lrm</span> and <span class="sc">rlm</span> characters display as very
thin blank characters; on text terminals they display as blanks.

   <p>Because characters are reordered for display, Emacs commands that
operate in the logical order or on stretches of buffer positions may
produce unusual effects.  For example, <kbd>C-f</kbd> and <kbd>C-b</kbd>
commands move point in the logical order, so the cursor will sometimes
jump when point traverses reordered bidirectional text.  Similarly, a
highlighted region covering a contiguous range of character positions
may look discontinuous if the region spans reordered text.  This is
normal and similar to the behavior of other programs that support
bidirectional text.  If you set <code>visual-order-cursor-movement</code> to
a non-<code>nil</code> value, cursor motion by the arrow keys follows the
visual order on screen (see <a href="#Moving-Point">visual-order movement</a>).

<h2 class="chapter">23 Major and Minor Modes</h2>

<p>Emacs contains many <dfn>editing modes</dfn> that alter its basic
behavior in useful ways.  These are divided into <dfn>major modes</dfn> and
<dfn>minor modes</dfn>.

   <p>Major modes provide specialized facilities for working on a
particular file type, such as a C source file (see <a href="#Programs">Programs</a>), or a
particular type of non-file buffer, such as a shell buffer
(see <a href="#Shell">Shell</a>).  Major modes are mutually exclusive; each buffer has
one and only one major mode at any time.

   <p>Minor modes are optional features which you can turn on or off, not
necessarily specific to a type of file or buffer.  For example, Auto
Fill mode is a minor mode in which &lt;SPC&gt; breaks lines between
words as you type (see <a href="#Auto-Fill">Auto Fill</a>).  Minor modes are independent of
one another, and of the selected major mode.

<h3 class="section">23.1 Major Modes</h3>

<p><a name="index-major-modes-1936"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-major-1937"></a><a name="index-TAB-_0040r_007b_0028and-major-modes_0029_007d-1938"></a><a name="index-DEL-_0040r_007b_0028and-major-modes_0029_007d-1939"></a><a name="index-C_002dj-_0040r_007b_0028and-major-modes_0029_007d-1940"></a>
  Every buffer possesses a major mode, which determines the editing
behavior of Emacs while that buffer is current.  The mode line
normally shows the name of the current major mode, in parentheses
(see <a href="#Mode-Line">Mode Line</a>).

   <p>The least specialized major mode is called <dfn>Fundamental mode</dfn>. 
This mode has no mode-specific redefinitions or variable settings, so
that each Emacs command behaves in its most general manner, and each
user option variable is in its default state.

   <p>For editing text of a specific type that Emacs knows about, such as
Lisp code or English text, you typically use a more specialized major
mode, such as Lisp mode or Text mode.  Most major modes fall into
three major groups.  The first group contains modes for normal text,
either plain or with mark-up.  It includes Text mode, HTML mode, SGML
mode, TeX mode and Outline mode.  The second group contains modes
for specific programming languages.  These include Lisp mode (which
has several variants), C mode, Fortran mode, and others.  The third
group consists of major modes that are not associated directly with
files; they are used in buffers created for specific purposes by
Emacs, such as Dired mode for buffers made by Dired (see <a href="#Dired">Dired</a>),
Message mode for buffers made by <kbd>C-x m</kbd> (see <a href="#Sending-Mail">Sending Mail</a>),
and Shell mode for buffers used to communicate with an inferior shell
process (see <a href="#Interactive-Shell">Interactive Shell</a>).

   <p>Usually, the major mode is automatically set by Emacs, when you
first visit a file or create a buffer (see <a href="#Choosing-Modes">Choosing Modes</a>).  You
can explicitly select a new major mode by using an <kbd>M-x</kbd> command. 
Take the name of the mode and add <code>-mode</code> to get the name of the
command to select that mode (e.g., <kbd>M-x lisp-mode</kbd> enters Lisp mode).

   <p><a name="index-major_002dmode-1941"></a>  The value of the buffer-local variable <code>major-mode</code> is a symbol
with the same name as the major mode command (e.g., <code>lisp-mode</code>). 
This variable is set automatically; you should not change it yourself.

   <p>The default value of <code>major-mode</code> determines the major mode to
use for files that do not specify a major mode, and for new buffers
created with <kbd>C-x b</kbd>.  Normally, this default value is the symbol
<code>fundamental-mode</code>, which specifies Fundamental mode.  You can
change this default value via the Customization interface (see <a href="#Easy-Customization">Easy Customization</a>), or by adding a line like this to your init file
(see <a href="#Init-File">Init File</a>):

<pre class="example">     (setq-default major-mode 'text-mode)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If the default value of <code>major-mode</code> is <code>nil</code>, the major
mode is taken from the previously current buffer.

   <p>Specialized major modes often change the meanings of certain keys to
do something more suitable for the mode.  For instance, programming
language modes bind &lt;TAB&gt; to indent the current line according to
the rules of the language (see <a href="#Indentation">Indentation</a>).  The keys that are
commonly changed are &lt;TAB&gt;, &lt;DEL&gt;, and <kbd>C-j</kbd>.  Many modes
also define special commands of their own, usually bound in the prefix
key <kbd>C-c</kbd>.  Major modes can also alter user options and variables;
for instance, programming language modes typically set a buffer-local
value for the variable <code>comment-start</code>, which determines how
source code comments are delimited (see <a href="#Comments">Comments</a>).

   <p><a name="index-describe_002dmode-1942"></a><a name="index-C_002dh-m-1943"></a>  To view the documentation for the current major mode, including a
list of its key bindings, type <code>C-h m</code> (<code>describe-mode</code>).

   <p><a name="index-mode-hook-1944"></a><a name="index-text_002dmode_002dhook-1945"></a><a name="index-prog_002dmode_002dhook-1946"></a>  Every major mode, apart from Fundamental mode, defines a <dfn>mode
hook</dfn>, a customizable list of Lisp functions to run each time the mode
is enabled in a buffer.  See <a href="#Hooks">Hooks</a>, for more information about
hooks.  Each mode hook is named after its major mode, e.g., Fortran
mode has <code>fortran-mode-hook</code>.  Furthermore, all text-based major
modes run <code>text-mode-hook</code>, and all programming language modes
run <code>prog-mode-hook</code>, prior to running their own mode hooks. 
Hook functions can look at the value of the variable <code>major-mode</code>
to see which mode is actually being entered.

   <p>Mode hooks are commonly used to enable minor modes (see <a href="#Minor-Modes">Minor Modes</a>).  For example, you can put the following lines in your init
file to enable Flyspell minor mode in all text-based major modes
(see <a href="#Spelling">Spelling</a>), and Eldoc minor mode in Emacs Lisp mode
(see <a href="#Lisp-Doc">Lisp Doc</a>):

<h3 class="section">23.2 Minor Modes</h3>

<p><a name="index-minor-modes-1947"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-minor-1948"></a>
  A minor mode is an optional editing mode that alters the behavior of
Emacs in some well-defined way.  Unlike major modes, any number of
minor modes can be in effect at any time.  Some minor modes are
<dfn>buffer-local</dfn>, and can be turned on (enabled) in certain buffers
and off (disabled) in others.  Other minor modes are <dfn>global</dfn>:
while enabled, they affect everything you do in the Emacs session, in
all buffers.  Most minor modes are disabled by default, but a few are
enabled by default.

   <p>Most buffer-local minor modes say in the mode line when they are
enabled, just after the major mode indicator.  For example,
`<samp><span class="samp">Fill</span></samp>' in the mode line means that Auto Fill mode is enabled. 
See <a href="#Mode-Line">Mode Line</a>.

   <p><a name="index-mode-commands-for-minor-modes-1949"></a>  Like major modes, each minor mode is associated with a <dfn>mode
command</dfn>, whose name consists of the mode name followed by
`<samp><span class="samp">-mode</span></samp>'.  For instance, the mode command for Auto Fill mode is
<code>auto-fill-mode</code>.  But unlike a major mode command, which simply
enables the mode, the mode command for a minor mode can either enable
or disable it:

     <ul>
<li>If you invoke the mode command directly with no prefix argument
(either via <kbd>M-x</kbd>, or by binding it to a key and typing that key;
see <a href="#Key-Bindings">Key Bindings</a>), that <dfn>toggles</dfn> the minor mode.  The minor
mode is turned on if it was off, and turned off if it was on.

     <li>If you invoke the mode command with a prefix argument, the minor mode
is unconditionally turned off if that argument is zero or negative;
otherwise, it is unconditionally turned on.

     <li>If the mode command is called via Lisp, the minor mode is
unconditionally turned on if the argument is omitted or <code>nil</code>. 
This makes it easy to turn on a minor mode from a major mode's mode
hook (see <a href="#Major-Modes">Major Modes</a>).  A non-<code>nil</code> argument is handled like
an interactive prefix argument, as described above. 
</ul>

   <p>Most minor modes also have a <dfn>mode variable</dfn>, with the same name
as the mode command.  Its value is non-<code>nil</code> if the mode is
enabled, and <code>nil</code> if it is disabled.  In general, you should not
try to enable or disable the mode by changing the value of the mode
variable directly in Lisp; you should run the mode command instead. 
However, setting the mode variable through the Customize interface
(see <a href="#Easy-Customization">Easy Customization</a>) will always properly enable or disable
the mode, since Customize automatically runs the mode command for you.

   <p>The following is a list of some buffer-local minor modes:

     <ul>
<li>Abbrev mode automatically expands text based on pre-defined
abbreviation definitions.  See <a href="#Abbrevs">Abbrevs</a>.

     <li>Auto Fill mode inserts newlines as you type to prevent lines from
becoming too long.  See <a href="#Filling">Filling</a>.

     <li>Auto Save mode saves the buffer contents periodically to reduce the
amount of work you can lose in case of a crash.  See <a href="#Auto-Save">Auto Save</a>.

     <li>Electric Quote mode automatically converts quotation marks.  For
example, it requotes text typed <tt>`like this'</tt> to text <tt>‘like
this’</tt>.  You can control what kind of text it operates in, and you can
disable it entirely in individual buffers.  See <a href="#Quotation-Marks">Quotation Marks</a>.

     <li>Enriched mode enables editing and saving of formatted text. 
See <a href="#Enriched-Text">Enriched Text</a>.

     <li>Flyspell mode automatically highlights misspelled words. 
See <a href="#Spelling">Spelling</a>.

     <li>Font-Lock mode automatically highlights certain textual units found in
programs.  It is enabled globally by default, but you can disable it
in individual buffers.  See <a href="#Faces">Faces</a>.

     <p><a name="index-linum_002dmode-1950"></a><a name="index-Linum-mode-1951"></a><li>Linum mode displays each line's line number in the window's left margin.

     <li>Outline minor mode provides similar facilities to the major mode
called Outline mode.  See <a href="#Outline-Mode">Outline Mode</a>.

     <p><a name="index-Overwrite-mode-1952"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Overwrite-1953"></a><a name="index-overwrite_002dmode-1954"></a><a name="index-INSERT-1955"></a><li>Overwrite mode causes ordinary printing characters to replace existing
text instead of shoving it to the right.  For example, if point is in
front of the `<samp><span class="samp">B</span></samp>' in `<samp><span class="samp">FOOBAR</span></samp>', then in Overwrite mode typing
a <kbd>G</kbd> changes it to `<samp><span class="samp">FOOGAR</span></samp>', instead of producing
`<samp><span class="samp">FOOGBAR</span></samp>' as usual.  In Overwrite mode, the command <kbd>C-q</kbd>
inserts the next character whatever it may be, even if it is a
digit&mdash;this gives you a way to insert a character instead of
replacing an existing character.  The mode command,
<code>overwrite-mode</code>, is bound to the &lt;Insert&gt; key.

     <p><a name="index-binary_002doverwrite_002dmode-1956"></a><li>Binary Overwrite mode is a variant of Overwrite mode for editing
binary files; it treats newlines and tabs like other characters, so
that they overwrite other characters and can be overwritten by them. 
In Binary Overwrite mode, digits after <kbd>C-q</kbd> specify an octal
character code, as usual.

     <li>Visual Line mode performs word wrapping, causing long lines to be
wrapped at word boundaries.  See <a href="#Visual-Line-Mode">Visual Line Mode</a>. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">And here are some useful global minor modes:

     <ul>
<li>Column Number mode enables display of the current column number in the
mode line.  See <a href="#Mode-Line">Mode Line</a>.

     <li>Delete Selection mode causes text insertion to first delete the text
in the region, if the region is active.  See <a href="#Using-Region">Using Region</a>.

     <li>Icomplete mode displays an indication of available completions when
you are in the minibuffer and completion is active.  See <a href="#Icomplete">Icomplete</a>.

     <li>Line Number mode enables display of the current line number in the
mode line.  It is enabled by default.  See <a href="#Mode-Line">Mode Line</a>.

     <li>Menu Bar mode gives each frame a menu bar.  It is enabled by default. 
See <a href="#Menu-Bars">Menu Bars</a>.

     <li>Scroll Bar mode gives each window a scroll bar.  It is enabled by
default, but the scroll bar is only displayed on graphical terminals. 
See <a href="#Scroll-Bars">Scroll Bars</a>.

     <li>Tool Bar mode gives each frame a tool bar.  It is enabled by default,
but the tool bar is only displayed on graphical terminals.  See <a href="#Tool-Bars">Tool Bars</a>.

     <li>Transient Mark mode highlights the region, and makes many Emacs
commands operate on the region when the mark is active.  It is enabled
by default.  See <a href="#Mark">Mark</a>.

<h3 class="section">23.3 Choosing File Modes</h3>

<p><a name="index-choosing-a-major-mode-1957"></a><a name="index-choosing-a-minor-mode-1958"></a><a name="index-auto_002dmode_002dalist-1959"></a>  When you visit a file, Emacs chooses a major mode automatically. 
Normally, it makes the choice based on the file name&mdash;for example,
files whose names end in `<samp><span class="samp">.c</span></samp>' are normally edited in C mode&mdash;but
sometimes it chooses the major mode based on special text in the file. 
This special text can also be used to enable buffer-local minor modes.

   <p>Here is the exact procedure:

   <p>First, Emacs checks whether the file contains file-local mode
variables.  See <a href="#File-Variables">File Variables</a>.  If there is a file-local variable
that specifies a major mode, then Emacs uses that major mode, ignoring
all other criteria.  There are several methods to specify a major mode
using a file-local variable; the simplest is to put the mode name in
the first nonblank line, preceded and followed by `<samp><span class="samp">-*-</span></samp>'.  Other
text may appear on the line as well.  For example,

<pre class="example">     ; -*-Lisp-*-
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">tells Emacs to use Lisp mode.  Note how the semicolon is used to make
Lisp treat this line as a comment.  You could equivalently write

<pre class="example">     ; -*- mode: Lisp;-*-
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You can also use file-local variables to specify buffer-local minor
modes, by using <code>eval</code> specifications.  For example, this first
nonblank line puts the buffer in Lisp mode and enables Auto-Fill mode:

<pre class="example">     ; -*- mode: Lisp; eval: (auto-fill-mode 1); -*-
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Note, however, that it is usually inappropriate to enable minor modes
this way, since most minor modes represent individual user
preferences.  If you personally want to use a minor mode for a
particular file type, it is better to enable the minor mode via a
major mode hook (see <a href="#Major-Modes">Major Modes</a>).

   <p><a name="index-interpreter_002dmode_002dalist-1960"></a>  Second, if there is no file variable specifying a major mode, Emacs
checks whether the file's contents begin with `<samp><span class="samp">#!</span></samp>'.  If so, that
indicates that the file can serve as an executable shell command,
which works by running an interpreter named on the file's first line
(the rest of the file is used as input to the interpreter). 
Therefore, Emacs tries to use the interpreter name to choose a mode. 
For instance, a file that begins with `<samp><span class="samp">#!/usr/bin/perl</span></samp>' is opened
in Perl mode.  The variable <code>interpreter-mode-alist</code> specifies
the correspondence between interpreter program names and major modes.

   <p>When the first line starts with `<samp><span class="samp">#!</span></samp>', you usually cannot use
the `<samp><span class="samp">-*-</span></samp>' feature on the first line, because the system would get
confused when running the interpreter.  So Emacs looks for `<samp><span class="samp">-*-</span></samp>'
on the second line in such files as well as on the first line.  The
same is true for man pages which start with the magic string
`<samp><span class="samp">'\"</span></samp>' to specify a list of troff preprocessors.

   <p><a name="index-magic_002dmode_002dalist-1961"></a>  Third, Emacs tries to determine the major mode by looking at the
text at the start of the buffer, based on the variable
<code>magic-mode-alist</code>.  By default, this variable is <code>nil</code> (an
empty list), so Emacs skips this step; however, you can customize it
in your init file (see <a href="#Init-File">Init File</a>).  The value should be a list of
elements of the form

<pre class="example">     (<var>regexp</var> . <var>mode-function</var>)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where <var>regexp</var> is a regular expression (see <a href="#Regexps">Regexps</a>), and
<var>mode-function</var> is a major mode command.  If the text at the
beginning of the file matches <var>regexp</var>, Emacs chooses the major
mode specified by <var>mode-function</var>.

   <p>Alternatively, an element of <code>magic-mode-alist</code> may have the form

<pre class="example">     (<var>match-function</var> . <var>mode-function</var>)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where <var>match-function</var> is a Lisp function that is called at the
beginning of the buffer; if the function returns non-<code>nil</code>, Emacs
set the major mode with <var>mode-function</var>.

   <p>Fourth&mdash;if Emacs still hasn't found a suitable major mode&mdash;it
looks at the file's name.  The correspondence between file names and
major modes is controlled by the variable <code>auto-mode-alist</code>.  Its
value is a list in which each element has this form,

<pre class="example">     (<var>regexp</var> . <var>mode-function</var>)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">or this form,

<pre class="example">     (<var>regexp</var> <var>mode-function</var> <var>flag</var>)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">For example, one element normally found in the list has the form
<code>(</code><tt>"\\.c\\'"</tt><code> . c-mode)</code>, and it is responsible for selecting C
mode for files whose names end in <samp><span class="file">.c</span></samp>.  (Note that `<samp><span class="samp">\\</span></samp>' is
needed in Lisp syntax to include a `<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>' in the string, which must
be used to suppress the special meaning of `<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>' in regexps.)  If
the element has the form <code>(</code><var>regexp</var> <var>mode-function</var>
<var>flag</var><code>)</code> and <var>flag</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, then after calling
<var>mode-function</var>, Emacs discards the suffix that matched
<var>regexp</var> and searches the list again for another match.

   <p><a name="index-auto_002dmode_002dcase_002dfold-1962"></a>  On GNU/Linux and other systems with case-sensitive file names, Emacs
performs a case-sensitive search through <code>auto-mode-alist</code>; if
this search fails, it performs a second case-insensitive search
through the alist.  To suppress the second search, change the variable
<code>auto-mode-case-fold</code> to <code>nil</code>.  On systems with
case-insensitive file names, such as Microsoft Windows, Emacs performs
a single case-insensitive search through <code>auto-mode-alist</code>.

   <p><a name="index-magic_002dfallback_002dmode_002dalist-1963"></a>  Finally, if Emacs <em>still</em> hasn't found a major mode to use, it
compares the text at the start of the buffer to the variable
<code>magic-fallback-mode-alist</code>.  This variable works like
<code>magic-mode-alist</code>, described above, except that is consulted
only after <code>auto-mode-alist</code>.  By default,
<code>magic-fallback-mode-alist</code> contains forms that check for image
files, HTML/XML/SGML files, PostScript files, and Unix style Conf
files.

   <p><a name="index-normal_002dmode-1964"></a>  If you have changed the major mode of a buffer, you can return to
the major mode Emacs would have chosen automatically, by typing
<kbd>M-x normal-mode</kbd>.  This is the same function that
<code>find-file</code> calls to choose the major mode.  It also processes
the file's `<samp><span class="samp">-*-</span></samp>' line or local variables list (if any). 
See <a href="#File-Variables">File Variables</a>.

   <p><a name="index-change_002dmajor_002dmode_002dwith_002dfile_002dname-1965"></a>  The commands <kbd>C-x C-w</kbd> and <code>set-visited-file-name</code> change to
a new major mode if the new file name implies a mode (see <a href="#Saving">Saving</a>). 
(<kbd>C-x C-s</kbd> does this too, if the buffer wasn't visiting a file.) 
However, this does not happen if the buffer contents specify a major
mode, and certain special major modes do not allow the mode to
change.  You can turn off this mode-changing feature by setting
<code>change-major-mode-with-file-name</code> to <code>nil</code>.

<h2 class="chapter">24 Indentation</h2>

<p><a name="index-indentation-1966"></a><a name="index-tabs-1967"></a><a name="index-columns-_0028indentation_0029-1968"></a>
<a name="index-whitespace-character-1969"></a>  <dfn>Indentation</dfn> refers to inserting or adjusting <dfn>whitespace
characters</dfn> (space and/or tab characters) at the beginning of a line
of text.  This chapter documents indentation commands and options
which are common to Text mode and related modes, as well as
programming language modes.  See <a href="#Program-Indent">Program Indent</a>, for additional
documentation about indenting in programming modes.

   <p><a name="index-indent_002dfor_002dtab_002dcommand-1970"></a><a name="index-TAB-_0040r_007b_0028indentation_0029_007d-1971"></a>  The simplest way to perform indentation is the &lt;TAB&gt; key.  In
most major modes, this runs the command <code>indent-for-tab-command</code>. 
(In C and related modes, &lt;TAB&gt; runs the command
<code>c-indent-line-or-region</code>, which behaves similarly).

     <dl>
<dt>&lt;TAB&gt;<dd>Insert whitespace, or indent the current line, in a mode-appropriate
way (<code>indent-for-tab-command</code>).  If the region is active, indent
all the lines within it. 
</dl>

   <p>The exact behavior of &lt;TAB&gt; depends on the major mode.  In Text
mode and related major modes, &lt;TAB&gt; normally inserts some
combination of space and tab characters to advance point to the next
tab stop (see <a href="#Tab-Stops">Tab Stops</a>).  For this purpose, the position of the
first non-whitespace character on the preceding line is treated as an
additional tab stop, so you can use &lt;TAB&gt; to align point with
the preceding line.  If the region is active (see <a href="#Using-Region">Using Region</a>),
&lt;TAB&gt; acts specially: it indents each line in the region so that
its first non-whitespace character is aligned with the preceding line.

   <p>In programming modes, &lt;TAB&gt; indents the current line of code in
a way that makes sense given the code in the preceding lines.  If the
region is active, all the lines in the region are indented this way. 
If point was initially within the current line's indentation, it is
repositioned to the first non-whitespace character on the line.

   <p>If you just want to insert a tab character in the buffer, type
<kbd>C-q &lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> (see <a href="#Inserting-Text">Inserting Text</a>).

<h3 class="section">24.1 Indentation Commands</h3>

<p>Apart from the &lt;TAB&gt; (<code>indent-for-tab-command</code>) command,
Emacs provides a variety of commands to perform indentation in other
ways.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-M-o</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dM_002do-1972"></a><a name="index-split_002dline-1973"></a>Split the current line at point (<code>split-line</code>).  The text on the
line after point becomes a new line, indented to the same column where
point is located.  This command first moves point forward over any
spaces and tabs.  Afterward, point is positioned before the inserted
newline.

     <p><a name="index-M_002dm-1974"></a><a name="index-back_002dto_002dindentation-1975"></a><br><dt><kbd>M-m</kbd><dd>Move (forward or back) to the first non-whitespace character on the
current line (<code>back-to-indentation</code>).  If there are no
non-whitespace characters on the line, move to the end of the line.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-i</kbd><dd><a name="index-M_002di-1976"></a><a name="index-tab_002dto_002dtab_002dstop-1977"></a>Indent whitespace at point, up to the next tab stop
(<code>tab-to-tab-stop</code>).  See <a href="#Tab-Stops">Tab Stops</a>.

     <p><a name="index-indent_002drelative-1978"></a><br><dt><kbd>M-x indent-relative</kbd><dd>Insert whitespace at point, until point is aligned with the first
non-whitespace character on the previous line (actually, the last
non-blank line).  If point is already farther right than that, run
<code>tab-to-tab-stop</code> instead&mdash;unless called with a numeric
argument, in which case do nothing.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-^</kbd><dd><a name="index-M_002d_005e-1979"></a><a name="index-delete_002dindentation-1980"></a>Merge the previous and the current line (<code>delete-indentation</code>). 
This joins the two lines cleanly, by replacing any indentation at
the front of the current line, together with the line boundary, with a
single space.

     <p>As a special case (useful for Lisp code), the single space is omitted
if the characters to be joined are consecutive opening and closing
parentheses, or if the junction follows another newline.

     <p>If there is a fill prefix, <kbd>M-^</kbd> deletes the fill prefix if it
appears after the newline that is deleted.  See <a href="#Fill-Prefix">Fill Prefix</a>.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-M-\</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dM_002d_005c-1981"></a><a name="index-indent_002dregion-1982"></a>Indent all the lines in the region, as though you had typed &lt;TAB&gt;
at the beginning of each line (<code>indent-region</code>).

     <p>If a numeric argument is supplied, indent every line in the region to
that column number.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-x &lt;TAB&gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dx-TAB-1983"></a><a name="index-indent_002drigidly-1984"></a><a name="index-remove-indentation-1985"></a>This command is used to change the indentation of all lines that begin
in the region, moving the affected lines as a rigid unit.

     <p>If called with no argument, the command activates a transient mode for
adjusting the indentation of the affected lines interactively.  While
this transient mode is active, typing &lt;LEFT&gt; or &lt;RIGHT&gt;
indents leftward and rightward, respectively, by one space.  You can
also type <kbd>S-&lt;LEFT&gt;</kbd> or <kbd>S-&lt;RIGHT&gt;</kbd> to indent leftward
or rightward to the next tab stop (see <a href="#Tab-Stops">Tab Stops</a>).  Typing any
other key disables the transient mode, and resumes normal editing.

     <p>If called with a prefix argument <var>n</var>, this command indents the
lines forward by <var>n</var> spaces (without enabling the transient mode). 
Negative values of <var>n</var> indent backward, so you can remove all
indentation from the lines in the region using a large negative
argument, like this:

     <pre class="smallexample">          C-u -999 C-x &lt;TAB&gt;
     </pre>

<h3 class="section">24.2 Tab Stops</h3>

<p><a name="index-tab-stops-1986"></a>
<a name="index-tab_002dstop_002dlist-1987"></a>  Emacs defines certain column numbers to be <dfn>tab stops</dfn>.  These
are used as stopping points by &lt;TAB&gt; when inserting whitespace in
Text mode and related modes (see <a href="#Indentation">Indentation</a>), and by commands
like <kbd>M-i</kbd> (see <a href="#Indentation-Commands">Indentation Commands</a>).  The variable
<code>tab-stop-list</code> controls these positions.  The default value is
<code>nil</code>, which means a tab stop every 8 columns.  The value can
also be a list of zero-based column numbers (in increasing order) at
which to place tab stops.  Emacs extends the list forever by repeating
the difference between the last and next-to-last elements.

   <p><a name="index-edit_002dtab_002dstops-1988"></a><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dc-_0040r_007b_0028Edit-Tab-Stops_0029_007d-1989"></a>  Instead of customizing the variable <code>tab-stop-list</code> directly, a
convenient way to view and set tab stops is via the command <kbd>M-x
edit-tab-stops</kbd>.  This switches to a buffer containing a description
of the tab stop settings, which looks like this:

<pre class="example">             :       :       :       :       :       :
     0         1         2         3         4
     0123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678
     To install changes, type C-c C-c
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The first line contains a colon at each tab stop.  The numbers on the
next two lines are present just to indicate where the colons are. 
If the value of <code>tab-stop-list</code> is <code>nil</code>, as it is by default,
no colons are displayed initially.

   <p>You can edit this buffer to specify different tab stops by placing
colons on the desired columns.  The buffer uses Overwrite mode
(see <a href="#Minor-Modes">Minor Modes</a>).  Remember that Emacs will extend the list of
tab stops forever by repeating the difference between the last two
explicit stops that you place.  When you are done, type <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> to make
the new tab stops take effect.  Normally, the new tab stop settings
apply to all buffers.  However, if you have made the
<code>tab-stop-list</code> variable local to the buffer where you called
<kbd>M-x edit-tab-stops</kbd> (see <a href="#Locals">Locals</a>), then the new tab stop
settings apply only to that buffer.  To save the tab stop settings for
future Emacs sessions, use the Customize interface to save the value
of <code>tab-stop-list</code> (see <a href="#Easy-Customization">Easy Customization</a>).

   <p>Note that the tab stops discussed in this section have nothing to do
with how tab characters are displayed in the buffer.  Tab characters
are always displayed as empty spaces extending to the next
<dfn>display tab stop</dfn>.  See <a href="#Text-Display">Text Display</a>.

<h3 class="section">24.3 Tabs vs. Spaces</h3>

<p><a name="index-tab_002dwidth-1990"></a>  Normally, indentation commands insert (or remove) an optimal mix of
space characters and tab characters to align to the desired column. 
Tab characters are displayed as a stretch of empty space extending to
the next <dfn>display tab stop</dfn>.  By default, there is one display tab
stop every <code>tab-width</code> columns (the default is 8).  See <a href="#Text-Display">Text Display</a>.

   <p><a name="index-indent_002dtabs_002dmode-1991"></a>  If you prefer, all indentation can be made from spaces only.  To
request this, set the buffer-local variable <code>indent-tabs-mode</code> to
<code>nil</code>.  See <a href="#Locals">Locals</a>, for information about setting buffer-local
variables.  Note, however, that <kbd>C-q &lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> always inserts a
tab character, regardless of the value of <code>indent-tabs-mode</code>.

   <p>One reason to set <code>indent-tabs-mode</code> to <code>nil</code> is that not
all editors display tab characters in the same way.  Emacs users, too,
may have different customized values of <code>tab-width</code>.  By using
spaces only, you can make sure that your file always looks the same. 
If you only care about how it looks within Emacs, another way to
tackle this problem is to set the <code>tab-width</code> variable in a
file-local variable (see <a href="#File-Variables">File Variables</a>).

   <p><a name="index-tabify-1992"></a><a name="index-untabify-1993"></a>  There are also commands to convert tabs to spaces or vice versa, always
preserving the columns of all non-whitespace text.  <kbd>M-x tabify</kbd> scans the
region for sequences of spaces, and converts sequences of at least two
spaces to tabs if that can be done without changing indentation.  <kbd>M-x
untabify</kbd> changes all tabs in the region to appropriate numbers of spaces.

<h3 class="section">24.4 Convenience Features for Indentation</h3>

<p><a name="index-tab_002dalways_002dindent-1994"></a>  The variable <code>tab-always-indent</code> tweaks the behavior of the
&lt;TAB&gt; (<code>indent-for-tab-command</code>) command.  The default value,
<code>t</code>, gives the behavior described in <a href="#Indentation">Indentation</a>.  If you
change the value to the symbol <code>complete</code>, then &lt;TAB&gt; first
tries to indent the current line, and if the line was already
indented, it tries to complete the text at point (see <a href="#Symbol-Completion">Symbol Completion</a>).  If the value is <code>nil</code>, then &lt;TAB&gt; indents the
current line only if point is at the left margin or in the line's
indentation; otherwise, it inserts a tab character.

   <p><a name="index-Electric-Indent-mode-1995"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Electric-Indent-1996"></a><a name="index-electric_002dindent_002dmode-1997"></a>  Electric Indent mode is a global minor mode that automatically
indents the line after every &lt;RET&gt; you type.  This mode is enabled
by default.  To toggle this minor mode, type <kbd>M-x
electric-indent-mode</kbd>.  To toggle the mode in a single buffer,
use <kbd>M-x electric-indent-local-mode</kbd>.

<h2 class="chapter">25 Commands for Human Languages</h2>

<p><a name="index-text-1998"></a><a name="index-manipulating-text-1999"></a>
  This chapter describes Emacs commands that act on <dfn>text</dfn>, by
which we mean sequences of characters in a human language (as opposed
to, say, a computer programming language).  These commands act in ways
that take into account the syntactic and stylistic conventions of
human languages: conventions involving words, sentences, paragraphs,
and capital letters.  There are also commands for <dfn>filling</dfn>, which
means rearranging the lines of a paragraph to be approximately equal
in length.  These commands, while intended primarily for editing text,
are also often useful for editing programs.

   <p>Emacs has several major modes for editing human-language text.  If
the file contains ordinary text, use Text mode, which customizes Emacs
in small ways for the syntactic conventions of text.  Outline mode
provides special commands for operating on text with an outline
structure.  Org mode extends Outline mode and turn Emacs into a
full-fledged organizer: you can manage TODO lists, store notes and
publish them in many formats.

   <p><a name="index-nXML-mode-2000"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-XML-2001"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-nXML-2002"></a><a name="index-nxml_002dmode-2003"></a>  Emacs has other major modes for text which contains embedded
commands, such as TeX and LaTeX (see <a href="#TeX-Mode">TeX Mode</a>); HTML and
SGML (see <a href="#HTML-Mode">HTML Mode</a>); XML
(see the nXML mode Info manual, which is distributed with Emacs);
and Groff and Nroff (see <a href="#Nroff-Mode">Nroff Mode</a>).

   <p><a name="index-ASCII-art-2004"></a>  If you need to edit ASCII art pictures made out of text characters,
use Picture mode, a special major mode for editing such pictures.

<h3 class="section">25.1 Words</h3>

<p><a name="index-words-2005"></a><a name="index-Meta-commands-and-words-2006"></a>
  Emacs defines several commands for moving over or operating on
words:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-f</kbd><dd>Move forward over a word (<code>forward-word</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-b</kbd><dd>Move backward over a word (<code>backward-word</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-d</kbd><dd>Kill up to the end of a word (<code>kill-word</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd><dd>Kill back to the beginning of a word (<code>backward-kill-word</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-@</kbd><dd>Mark the end of the next word (<code>mark-word</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-t</kbd><dd>Transpose two words or drag a word across others
(<code>transpose-words</code>). 
</dl>

   <p>Notice how these keys form a series that parallels the character-based
<kbd>C-f</kbd>, <kbd>C-b</kbd>, <kbd>C-d</kbd>, &lt;DEL&gt; and <kbd>C-t</kbd>.  <kbd>M-@</kbd> is
cognate to <kbd>C-@</kbd>, which is an alias for <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-M_002df-2007"></a><a name="index-M_002db-2008"></a><a name="index-forward_002dword-2009"></a><a name="index-backward_002dword-2010"></a>  The commands <kbd>M-f</kbd> (<code>forward-word</code>) and <kbd>M-b</kbd>
(<code>backward-word</code>) move forward and backward over words.  These
&lt;META&gt;-based key sequences are analogous to the key sequences
<kbd>C-f</kbd> and <kbd>C-b</kbd>, which move over single characters.  The
analogy extends to numeric arguments, which serve as repeat counts. 
<kbd>M-f</kbd> with a negative argument moves backward, and <kbd>M-b</kbd> with
a negative argument moves forward.  Forward motion stops right after
the last letter of the word, while backward motion stops right before
the first letter.

   <p><a name="index-M_002dd-2011"></a><a name="index-kill_002dword-2012"></a>  <kbd>M-d</kbd> (<code>kill-word</code>) kills the word after point.  To be
precise, it kills everything from point to the place <kbd>M-f</kbd> would
move to.  Thus, if point is in the middle of a word, <kbd>M-d</kbd> kills
just the part after point.  If some punctuation comes between point
and the next word, it is killed along with the word.  (If you wish to
kill only the next word but not the punctuation before it, simply do
<kbd>M-f</kbd> to get the end, and kill the word backwards with
<kbd>M-&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd>.)  <kbd>M-d</kbd> takes arguments just like <kbd>M-f</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-backward_002dkill_002dword-2013"></a><a name="index-M_002dDEL-2014"></a>  <kbd>M-&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd> (<code>backward-kill-word</code>) kills the word before
point.  It kills everything from point back to where <kbd>M-b</kbd> would
move to.  For instance, if point is after the space in `<samp><span class="samp">FOO,&nbsp;BAR</span></samp>'<!-- /@w -->, it kills `<samp><span class="samp">FOO,&nbsp;</span></samp>'<!-- /@w -->.  If you wish to kill just
`<samp><span class="samp">FOO</span></samp>', and not the comma and the space, use <kbd>M-b M-d</kbd> instead
of <kbd>M-&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd>.

<!-- Don't index M-t and transpose-words here, they are indexed in -->
<!-- fixit.texi, in the node "Transpose". -->
<!-- @kindex M-t -->
<!-- @findex transpose-words -->
<p><kbd>M-t</kbd> (<code>transpose-words</code>) exchanges the word before or
containing point with the following word.  The delimiter characters between
the words do not move.  For example, `<samp><span class="samp">FOO,&nbsp;BAR</span></samp>'<!-- /@w --> transposes into
`<samp><span class="samp">BAR,&nbsp;FOO</span></samp>'<!-- /@w --> rather than `<samp><span class="samp">BAR&nbsp;FOO,<!-- /@w --></span></samp>'.  See <a href="#Transpose">Transpose</a>, for
more on transposition.

   <p><a name="index-M_002d_0040_0040-2015"></a><a name="index-mark_002dword-2016"></a>  To operate on words with an operation which acts on the region, use
the command <kbd>M-@</kbd> (<code>mark-word</code>).  This command sets the mark
where <kbd>M-f</kbd> would move to.  See <a href="#Marking-Objects">Marking Objects</a>, for more
information about this command.

   <p>The word commands' understanding of word boundaries is controlled by

<p><a name="index-sentences-2017"></a><a name="index-manipulating-sentences-2018"></a>
  The Emacs commands for manipulating sentences and paragraphs are
mostly on Meta keys, like the word-handling commands.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-a</kbd><dd>Move back to the beginning of the sentence (<code>backward-sentence</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-e</kbd><dd>Move forward to the end of the sentence (<code>forward-sentence</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-k</kbd><dd>Kill forward to the end of the sentence (<code>kill-sentence</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x &lt;DEL&gt;</kbd><dd>Kill back to the beginning of the sentence (<code>backward-kill-sentence</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-M_002da-2019"></a><a name="index-M_002de-2020"></a><a name="index-backward_002dsentence-2021"></a><a name="index-forward_002dsentence-2022"></a>  The commands <kbd>M-a</kbd> (<code>backward-sentence</code>) and <kbd>M-e</kbd>
(<code>forward-sentence</code>) move to the beginning and end of the current
sentence, respectively.  Their bindings were chosen to resemble
<kbd>C-a</kbd> and <kbd>C-e</kbd>, which move to the beginning and end of a
line.  Unlike them, <kbd>M-a</kbd> and <kbd>M-e</kbd> move over successive
sentences if repeated.

   <p>Moving backward over a sentence places point just before the first
character of the sentence; moving forward places point right after the
punctuation that ends the sentence.  Neither one moves over the
whitespace at the sentence boundary.

   <p><a name="index-M_002dk-2023"></a><a name="index-kill_002dsentence-2024"></a>  Just as <kbd>C-a</kbd> and <kbd>C-e</kbd> have a kill command, <kbd>C-k</kbd>, to
go with them, <kbd>M-a</kbd> and <kbd>M-e</kbd> have a corresponding kill
command: <kbd>M-k</kbd> (<code>kill-sentence</code>) kills from point to the end
of the sentence.  With a positive numeric argument <var>n</var>, it kills
the next <var>n</var> sentences; with a negative argument &minus;<var>n</var>,
it kills back to the beginning of the <var>n</var>th preceding sentence.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-DEL-2025"></a><a name="index-backward_002dkill_002dsentence-2026"></a>  The <kbd>C-x &lt;DEL&gt;</kbd> (<code>backward-kill-sentence</code>) kills back
to the beginning of a sentence.

   <p>The sentence commands assume that you follow the American typist's
convention of putting two spaces at the end of a sentence.  That is, a
sentence ends wherever there is a `<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>'
followed by the end of a line or two spaces, with any number of
`<samp><span class="samp">)</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">'</span></samp>', or `<samp><span class="samp">"</span></samp>' characters allowed in
between.  A sentence also begins or ends wherever a paragraph begins
or ends.  It is useful to follow this convention, because it allows
the Emacs sentence commands to distinguish between periods that end a
sentence and periods that indicate abbreviations.

   <p><a name="index-sentence_002dend_002ddouble_002dspace-2027"></a>  If you want to use just one space between sentences, you can set the
variable <code>sentence-end-double-space</code> to <code>nil</code> to make the
sentence commands stop for single spaces.  However, this has a
drawback: there is no way to distinguish between periods that end
sentences and those that indicate abbreviations.  For convenient and
reliable editing, we therefore recommend you follow the two-space
convention.  The variable <code>sentence-end-double-space</code> also
affects filling (see <a href="#Fill-Commands">Fill Commands</a>).

   <p><a name="index-sentence_002dend-2028"></a>  The variable <code>sentence-end</code> controls how to recognize the end
of a sentence.  If non-<code>nil</code>, its value should be a regular
expression, which is used to match the last few characters of a
sentence, together with the whitespace following the sentence
(see <a href="#Regexps">Regexps</a>).  If the value is <code>nil</code>, the default, then
Emacs computes sentence ends according to various criteria such as the
value of <code>sentence-end-double-space</code>.

   <p><a name="index-sentence_002dend_002dwithout_002dperiod-2029"></a>  Some languages, such as Thai, do not use periods to indicate the end
of a sentence.  Set the variable <code>sentence-end-without-period</code> to
<code>t</code> in such cases.

<h3 class="section">25.3 Paragraphs</h3>

<p><a name="index-paragraphs-2030"></a><a name="index-manipulating-paragraphs-2031"></a>
  The Emacs commands for manipulating paragraphs are also on Meta keys.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-{</kbd><dd>Move back to previous paragraph beginning (<code>backward-paragraph</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-}</kbd><dd>Move forward to next paragraph end (<code>forward-paragraph</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-h</kbd><dd>Put point and mark around this or next paragraph (<code>mark-paragraph</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-M_002d_0040_007b-2032"></a><a name="index-M_002d_0040_007d-2033"></a><a name="index-backward_002dparagraph-2034"></a><a name="index-forward_002dparagraph-2035"></a>  <kbd>M-{</kbd> (<code>backward-paragraph</code>) moves to the beginning of the
current or previous paragraph (see below for the definition of a
paragraph).  <kbd>M-}</kbd> (<code>forward-paragraph</code>) moves to the end of
the current or next paragraph.  If there is a blank line before the
paragraph, <kbd>M-{</kbd> moves to the blank line.

   <p><a name="index-M_002dh-2036"></a><a name="index-mark_002dparagraph-2037"></a>  When you wish to operate on a paragraph, type <kbd>M-h</kbd>
(<code>mark-paragraph</code>) to set the region around it.  For example,
<kbd>M-h C-w</kbd> kills the paragraph around or after point.  <kbd>M-h</kbd>
puts point at the beginning and mark at the end of the paragraph point
was in.  If point is between paragraphs (in a run of blank lines, or
at a boundary), <kbd>M-h</kbd> sets the region around the paragraph
following point.  If there are blank lines preceding the first line of
the paragraph, one of these blank lines is included in the region.  If
the region is already active, the command sets the mark without
changing point, and each subsequent <kbd>M-h</kbd> further advances the
mark by one paragraph.

   <p>The definition of a paragraph depends on the major mode.  In
Fundamental mode, as well as Text mode and related modes, a paragraph
is separated each neighboring paragraph another by one or more
<dfn>blank lines</dfn>&mdash;lines that are either empty, or consist solely of
space, tab and/or formfeed characters.  In programming language modes,
paragraphs are usually defined in a similar way, so that you can use
the paragraph commands even though there are no paragraphs as such in
a program.

   <p>Note that an indented line is <em>not</em> itself a paragraph break in
Text mode.  If you want indented lines to separate paragraphs, use
Paragraph-Indent Text mode instead.  See <a href="#Text-Mode">Text Mode</a>.

   <p>If you set a fill prefix, then paragraphs are delimited by all lines
which don't start with the fill prefix.  See <a href="#Filling">Filling</a>.

   <p><a name="index-paragraph_002dstart-2038"></a><a name="index-paragraph_002dseparate-2039"></a>  The precise definition of a paragraph boundary is controlled by the
variables <code>paragraph-separate</code> and <code>paragraph-start</code>.  The
value of <code>paragraph-start</code> is a regular expression that should
match lines that either start or separate paragraphs
(see <a href="#Regexps">Regexps</a>).  The value of <code>paragraph-separate</code> is another
regular expression that should match lines that separate paragraphs
without being part of any paragraph (for example, blank lines).  Lines
that start a new paragraph and are contained in it must match only
<code>paragraph-start</code>, not <code>paragraph-separate</code>.  For example,
in Fundamental mode, <code>paragraph-start</code> is <code>"\f\\|[&nbsp;\t]*$"</code><!-- /@w -->, and <code>paragraph-separate</code> is <code>"[&nbsp;\t\f]*$"</code><!-- /@w -->.

<h3 class="section">25.4 Pages</h3>

<p><a name="index-pages-2040"></a><a name="index-formfeed-character-2041"></a>  Within some text files, text is divided into <dfn>pages</dfn> delimited
by the <dfn>formfeed character</dfn> (<acronym>ASCII</acronym> code 12, also denoted
as `<samp><span class="samp">control-L</span></samp>'), which is displayed in Emacs as the escape
sequence `<samp><span class="samp">^L</span></samp>' (see <a href="#Text-Display">Text Display</a>).  Traditionally, when such
text files are printed to hardcopy, each formfeed character forces a
page break.  Most Emacs commands treat it just like any other
character, so you can insert it with <kbd>C-q C-l</kbd>, delete it with
&lt;DEL&gt;, etc.  In addition, Emacs provides commands to move over
pages and operate on them.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-x what-page</kbd><dd>Display the page number of point, and the line number within that page. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x [</kbd><dd>Move point to previous page boundary (<code>backward-page</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x ]</kbd><dd>Move point to next page boundary (<code>forward-page</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x C-p</kbd><dd>Put point and mark around this page (or another page) (<code>mark-page</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x l</kbd><dd>Count the lines in this page (<code>count-lines-page</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-what_002dpage-2042"></a>  <kbd>M-x what-page</kbd> counts pages from the beginning of the file, and
counts lines within the page, showing both numbers in the echo area.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-_005b-2043"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-_005d-2044"></a><a name="index-forward_002dpage-2045"></a><a name="index-backward_002dpage-2046"></a>  The <kbd>C-x [</kbd> (<code>backward-page</code>) command moves point to immediately
after the previous page delimiter.  If point is already right after a page
delimiter, it skips that one and stops at the previous one.  A numeric
argument serves as a repeat count.  The <kbd>C-x ]</kbd> (<code>forward-page</code>)
command moves forward past the next page delimiter.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dp-2047"></a><a name="index-mark_002dpage-2048"></a>  The <kbd>C-x C-p</kbd> command (<code>mark-page</code>) puts point at the
beginning of the current page (after that page delimiter at the
front), and the mark at the end of the page (after the page delimiter
at the end).

   <p><kbd>C-x C-p C-w</kbd> is a handy way to kill a page to move it
elsewhere.  If you move to another page delimiter with <kbd>C-x [</kbd> and
<kbd>C-x ]</kbd>, then yank the killed page, all the pages will be properly
delimited once again.  The reason <kbd>C-x C-p</kbd> includes only the
following page delimiter in the region is to ensure that.

   <p>A numeric argument to <kbd>C-x C-p</kbd> specifies which page to go to,
relative to the current one.  Zero means the current page, one
the next page, and &minus;1 the previous one.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-l-2049"></a><a name="index-count_002dlines_002dpage-2050"></a>  The <kbd>C-x l</kbd> command (<code>count-lines-page</code>) is good for deciding
where to break a page in two.  It displays in the echo area the total number
of lines in the current page, and then divides it up into those preceding
the current line and those following, as in

<pre class="example">     Page has 96 (72+25) lines
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Notice that the sum is off by one; this is correct if point is not at the
beginning of a line.

   <p><a name="index-page_002ddelimiter-2051"></a>  The variable <code>page-delimiter</code> controls where pages begin.  Its
value is a regular expression that matches the beginning of a line
that separates pages (see <a href="#Regexps">Regexps</a>).  The normal value of this
variable is <code>"^\f"</code>, which matches a formfeed character at the
beginning of a line.

using straight apostrophes <tt>'like this'</tt> or double-quotes <tt>"like
this"</tt>.  Another common way is the curved quote convention, which uses
left and right single or double quotation marks <tt>‘like this’</tt> or
<tt>“like this”</tt>.  In text files, typewriter quotes are simple and
portable; curved quotes are less ambiguous and typically look nicer.

   <p>Electric Quote mode makes it easier to type curved quotes.  As you
type characters it optionally converts <tt>`</tt> to <tt>‘</tt>, <tt>'</tt> to <tt>’</tt>,
<tt>&ldquo;</tt> to <tt>“</tt>, and <tt>&rdquo;</tt> to <tt>”</tt>.  These conversions are
suppressed in buffers whose coding systems cannot represent curved
quote characters.

   <p><a name="index-electric_002dquote_002dparagraph-2058"></a><a name="index-electric_002dquote_002dcomment-2059"></a><a name="index-electric_002dquote_002dstring-2060"></a>  You can customize the behavior of Electric Quote mode by customizing
variables that control where it is active.  It is active in text
paragraphs if <code>electric-quote-paragraph</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, in
programming-language comments if <code>electric-quote-comment</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>, and in programming-language strings if
<code>electric-quote-string</code> is non-<code>nil</code>.  The default is
<code>nil</code> for <code>electric-quote-string</code> and <code>t</code> for the other
variables.

   <p>Electric Quote mode is disabled by default.  To toggle it, type
<kbd>M-x electric-quote-mode</kbd>.  To toggle it in a single buffer, use
<kbd>M-x electric-quote-local-mode</kbd>.  To suppress it for a single use,
type <kbd>C-q `</kbd> or <kbd>C-q '</kbd> instead of <kbd>`</kbd> or <kbd>'</kbd>.  To
insert a curved quote even when Electric Quote is disabled or
inactive, you can type <kbd>C-x 8 [</kbd> for <tt>‘</tt>, <kbd>C-x 8 ]</kbd> for
<tt>’</tt>, <kbd>C-x 8 {</kbd> for <tt>“</tt>, and <kbd>C-x 8 }</kbd> for <tt>”</tt>.

<h3 class="section">25.6 Filling Text</h3>

<p><a name="index-filling-text-2061"></a>
  <dfn>Filling</dfn> text means breaking it up into lines that fit a
specified width.  Emacs does filling in two ways.  In Auto Fill mode,
inserting text with self-inserting characters also automatically fills
it.  There are also explicit fill commands that you can use when editing
text.

<h4 class="subsection">25.6.1 Auto Fill Mode</h4>

<p><a name="index-Auto-Fill-mode-2062"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Auto-Fill-2063"></a>
  <dfn>Auto Fill</dfn> mode is a buffer-local minor mode (see <a href="#Minor-Modes">Minor Modes</a>) in which lines are broken automatically when they become too
wide.  Breaking happens only when you type a &lt;SPC&gt; or &lt;RET&gt;.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-x auto-fill-mode</kbd><dd>Enable or disable Auto Fill mode. 
<br><dt><kbd>&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd><dt><kbd>&lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>In Auto Fill mode, break lines when appropriate. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-auto_002dfill_002dmode-2064"></a>  The mode command <kbd>M-x auto-fill-mode</kbd> toggles Auto Fill mode in
the current buffer.  With a positive numeric argument, it enables Auto
Fill mode, and with a negative argument it disables it.  If
<code>auto-fill-mode</code> is called from Lisp with an omitted or
<code>nil</code> argument, it enables Auto Fill mode.  To enable Auto Fill
mode automatically in certain major modes, add <code>auto-fill-mode</code>
to the mode hooks (see <a href="#Major-Modes">Major Modes</a>).  When Auto Fill mode is
enabled, the mode indicator `<samp><span class="samp">Fill</span></samp>' appears in the mode line
(see <a href="#Mode-Line">Mode Line</a>).

   <p>Auto Fill mode breaks lines automatically at spaces whenever they
get longer than the desired width.  This line breaking occurs only
when you type &lt;SPC&gt; or &lt;RET&gt;.  If you wish to insert a space
or newline without permitting line-breaking, type <kbd>C-q &lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>
or <kbd>C-q C-j</kbd> respectively.  Also, <kbd>C-o</kbd> inserts a newline
without line breaking.

   <p>When Auto Fill mode breaks a line, it tries to obey the
<dfn>adaptive fill prefix</dfn>: if a fill prefix can be deduced from the
first and/or second line of the current paragraph, it is inserted into
the new line (see <a href="#Adaptive-Fill">Adaptive Fill</a>).  Otherwise the new line is
indented, as though you had typed &lt;TAB&gt; on it
(see <a href="#Indentation">Indentation</a>).  In a programming language mode, if a line is
broken in the middle of a comment, the comment is split by inserting
new comment delimiters as appropriate.

   <p>Auto Fill mode does not refill entire paragraphs; it breaks lines
but does not merge lines.  Therefore, editing in the middle of a
paragraph can result in a paragraph that is not correctly filled.  To
fill it, call the explicit fill commands
(see <a href="#Fill-Commands">Fill Commands</a>).

<br><dt><kbd>M-x fill-region-as-paragraph</kbd><dd>Fill the region, considering it as one paragraph. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-o M-s</kbd><dd>Center a line. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-M_002dq-2065"></a><a name="index-fill_002dparagraph-2066"></a>  The command <kbd>M-q</kbd> (<code>fill-paragraph</code>) <dfn>fills</dfn> the
current paragraph.  It redistributes the line breaks within the
paragraph, and deletes any excess space and tab characters occurring
within the paragraph, in such a way that the lines end up fitting
within a certain maximum width.

   <p><a name="index-fill_002dregion-2067"></a>  Normally, <kbd>M-q</kbd> acts on the paragraph where point is, but if
point is between paragraphs, it acts on the paragraph after point.  If
the region is active, it acts instead on the text in the region.  You
can also call <kbd>M-x fill-region</kbd> to specifically fill the text in
the region.

   <p><a name="index-fill_002dregion_002das_002dparagraph-2068"></a>  <kbd>M-q</kbd> and <code>fill-region</code> use the usual Emacs criteria for
finding paragraph boundaries (see <a href="#Paragraphs">Paragraphs</a>).  For more control,
you can use <kbd>M-x fill-region-as-paragraph</kbd>, which refills
everything between point and mark as a single paragraph.  This command
deletes any blank lines within the region, so separate blocks of text
end up combined into one block.

   <p><a name="index-justification-2069"></a>  A numeric argument to <kbd>M-q</kbd> tells it to <dfn>justify</dfn> the text
as well as filling it.  This means that extra spaces are inserted to
make the right margin line up exactly at the fill column.  To remove
the extra spaces, use <kbd>M-q</kbd> with no argument.  (Likewise for
<code>fill-region</code>.)

   <p><a name="index-fill_002dcolumn-2070"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-f-2071"></a><a name="index-set_002dfill_002dcolumn-2072"></a>  The maximum line width for filling is specified by the buffer-local
variable <code>fill-column</code>.  The default value (see <a href="#Locals">Locals</a>) is
70.  The easiest way to set <code>fill-column</code> in the current buffer
is to use the command <kbd>C-x f</kbd> (<code>set-fill-column</code>).  With a
numeric argument, it uses that as the new fill column.  With just
<kbd>C-u</kbd> as argument, it sets <code>fill-column</code> to the current
horizontal position of point.

   <p><a name="index-M_002do-M_002ds-_0040r_007b_0028Text-mode_0029_007d-2073"></a><a name="index-centering-2074"></a><a name="index-center_002dline-2075"></a>  The command <kbd>M-o M-s</kbd> (<code>center-line</code>) centers the current line
within the current fill column.  With an argument <var>n</var>, it centers
<var>n</var> lines individually and moves past them.  This binding is
made by Text mode and is available only in that and related modes
(see <a href="#Text-Mode">Text Mode</a>).

   <p>By default, Emacs considers a period followed by two spaces or by a
newline as the end of a sentence; a period followed by just one space
indicates an abbreviation, not the end of a sentence.  Accordingly,
the fill commands will not break a line after a period followed by
just one space.  If you set the variable
<code>sentence-end-double-space</code> to <code>nil</code>, the fill commands will
break a line after a period followed by one space, and put just one
space after each period.  See <a href="#Sentences">Sentences</a>, for other effects and
possible drawbacks of this.

   <p><a name="index-colon_002ddouble_002dspace-2076"></a>  If the variable <code>colon-double-space</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, the
fill commands put two spaces after a colon.

   <p><a name="index-fill_002dnobreak_002dpredicate-2077"></a>  To specify additional conditions where line-breaking is not allowed,
customize the abnormal hook variable <code>fill-nobreak-predicate</code>
(see <a href="#Hooks">Hooks</a>).  Each function in this hook is called with no
arguments, with point positioned where Emacs is considering breaking a
line.  If a function returns a non-<code>nil</code> value, Emacs will not
break the line there.  Functions you can use there include:
<code>fill-single-word-nobreak-p</code> (don't break after the first word of
a sentence or before the last); <code>fill-single-char-nobreak-p</code>
(don't break after a one-letter word); and <code>fill-french-nobreak-p</code>
(don't break after `<samp><span class="samp">(</span></samp>' or before `<samp><span class="samp">)</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>').

<h4 class="subsection">25.6.3 The Fill Prefix</h4>

<p><a name="index-fill-prefix-2078"></a>  The <dfn>fill prefix</dfn> feature allows paragraphs to be filled so that
each line starts with a special string of characters (such as a
sequence of spaces, giving an indented paragraph).  You can specify a
fill prefix explicitly; otherwise, Emacs tries to deduce one
automatically (see <a href="#Adaptive-Fill">Adaptive Fill</a>).

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x .</kbd><dd>Set the fill prefix (<code>set-fill-prefix</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-q</kbd><dd>Fill a paragraph using current fill prefix (<code>fill-paragraph</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x fill-individual-paragraphs</kbd><dd>Fill the region, considering each change of indentation as starting a
new paragraph. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x fill-nonuniform-paragraphs</kbd><dd>Fill the region, considering only paragraph-separator lines as starting
a new paragraph. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-_002e-2079"></a><a name="index-set_002dfill_002dprefix-2080"></a>  To specify a fill prefix for the current buffer, move to a line that
starts with the desired prefix, put point at the end of the prefix,
and type <kbd>C-x&nbsp;.</kbd><!-- /@w --> (<code>set-fill-prefix</code>).  (That's a period
after the <kbd>C-x</kbd>.)  To turn off the fill prefix, specify an empty
prefix: type <kbd>C-x&nbsp;.</kbd><!-- /@w --> with point at the beginning of a line.

   <p>When a fill prefix is in effect, the fill commands remove the fill
prefix from each line of the paragraph before filling, and insert it
on each line after filling.  (The beginning of the first line of the
paragraph is left unchanged, since often that is intentionally
different.)  Auto Fill mode also inserts the fill prefix automatically
when it makes a new line (see <a href="#Auto-Fill">Auto Fill</a>).  The <kbd>C-o</kbd> command
inserts the fill prefix on new lines it creates, when you use it at
the beginning of a line (see <a href="#Blank-Lines">Blank Lines</a>).  Conversely, the
command <kbd>M-^</kbd> deletes the prefix (if it occurs) after the newline
that it deletes (see <a href="#Indentation">Indentation</a>).

   <p>For example, if <code>fill-column</code> is 40 and you set the fill prefix
to `<samp><span class="samp">;; </span></samp>', then <kbd>M-q</kbd> in the following text

<pre class="example">     ;; This is an
     ;; example of a paragraph
     ;; inside a Lisp-style comment.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">produces this:

<pre class="example">     ;; This is an example of a paragraph
     ;; inside a Lisp-style comment.
</pre>
   <p>Lines that do not start with the fill prefix are considered to start
paragraphs, both in <kbd>M-q</kbd> and the paragraph commands; this gives
good results for paragraphs with hanging indentation (every line
indented except the first one).  Lines which are blank or indented once
the prefix is removed also separate or start paragraphs; this is what
you want if you are writing multi-paragraph comments with a comment
delimiter on each line.

   <p><a name="index-fill_002dindividual_002dparagraphs-2081"></a>  You can use <kbd>M-x fill-individual-paragraphs</kbd> to set the fill
prefix for each paragraph automatically.  This command divides the
region into paragraphs, treating every change in the amount of
indentation as the start of a new paragraph, and fills each of these
paragraphs.  Thus, all the lines in one paragraph have the same
amount of indentation.  That indentation serves as the fill prefix for
that paragraph.

   <p><a name="index-fill_002dnonuniform_002dparagraphs-2082"></a>  <kbd>M-x fill-nonuniform-paragraphs</kbd> is a similar command that divides
the region into paragraphs in a different way.  It considers only
paragraph-separating lines (as defined by <code>paragraph-separate</code>) as
starting a new paragraph.  Since this means that the lines of one
paragraph may have different amounts of indentation, the fill prefix
used is the smallest amount of indentation of any of the lines of the
paragraph.  This gives good results with styles that indent a paragraph's
first line more or less that the rest of the paragraph.

   <p><a name="index-fill_002dprefix-2083"></a>  The fill prefix is stored in the variable <code>fill-prefix</code>.  Its value
is a string, or <code>nil</code> when there is no fill prefix.  This is a
per-buffer variable; altering the variable affects only the current buffer,
but there is a default value which you can change as well.  See <a href="#Locals">Locals</a>.

   <p>The <code>indentation</code> text property provides another way to control
the amount of indentation paragraphs receive.  See <a href="#Enriched-Indentation">Enriched Indentation</a>.

<h4 class="subsection">25.6.4 Adaptive Filling</h4>

<p><a name="index-adaptive-filling-2084"></a>  The fill commands can deduce the proper fill prefix for a paragraph
automatically in certain cases: either whitespace or certain punctuation
characters at the beginning of a line are propagated to all lines of the
paragraph.

   <p>If the paragraph has two or more lines, the fill prefix is taken from
the paragraph's second line, but only if it appears on the first line as
well.

   <p>If a paragraph has just one line, fill commands <em>may</em> take a
prefix from that line.  The decision is complicated because there are
three reasonable things to do in such a case:

     <ul>
<li>Use the first line's prefix on all the lines of the paragraph.

     <li>Indent subsequent lines with whitespace, so that they line up under the
text that follows the prefix on the first line, but don't actually copy
the prefix from the first line.

     <li>Don't do anything special with the second and following lines. 
</ul>

   <p>All three of these styles of formatting are commonly used.  So the
fill commands try to determine what you would like, based on the prefix
that appears and on the major mode.  Here is how.

   <p><a name="index-adaptive_002dfill_002dfirst_002dline_002dregexp-2085"></a>  If the prefix found on the first line matches
<code>adaptive-fill-first-line-regexp</code>, or if it appears to be a
comment-starting sequence (this depends on the major mode), then the
prefix found is used for filling the paragraph, provided it would not
act as a paragraph starter on subsequent lines.

   <p>Otherwise, the prefix found is converted to an equivalent number of
spaces, and those spaces are used as the fill prefix for the rest of the
lines, provided they would not act as a paragraph starter on subsequent
lines.

   <p>In Text mode, and other modes where only blank lines and page
delimiters separate paragraphs, the prefix chosen by adaptive filling
never acts as a paragraph starter, so it can always be used for filling.

   <p><a name="index-adaptive_002dfill_002dmode-2086"></a><a name="index-adaptive_002dfill_002dregexp-2087"></a>  The variable <code>adaptive-fill-regexp</code> determines what kinds of line
beginnings can serve as a fill prefix: any characters at the start of
the line that match this regular expression are used.  If you set the
variable <code>adaptive-fill-mode</code> to <code>nil</code>, the fill prefix is
never chosen automatically.

   <p><a name="index-adaptive_002dfill_002dfunction-2088"></a>  You can specify more complex ways of choosing a fill prefix
automatically by setting the variable <code>adaptive-fill-function</code> to a
function.  This function is called with point after the left margin of a
line, and it should return the appropriate fill prefix based on that
line.  If it returns <code>nil</code>, <code>adaptive-fill-regexp</code> gets
a chance to find a prefix.

<h3 class="section">25.7 Case Conversion Commands</h3>

<p><a name="index-case-conversion-2089"></a>
  Emacs has commands for converting either a single word or any arbitrary
range of text to upper case or to lower case.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-l</kbd><dd>Convert following word to lower case (<code>downcase-word</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-u</kbd><dd>Convert following word to upper case (<code>upcase-word</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-c</kbd><dd>Capitalize the following word (<code>capitalize-word</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x C-l</kbd><dd>Convert region to lower case (<code>downcase-region</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x C-u</kbd><dd>Convert region to upper case (<code>upcase-region</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-M_002dl-2090"></a><a name="index-M_002du-2091"></a><a name="index-M_002dc-2092"></a><a name="index-words_002c-case-conversion-2093"></a><a name="index-converting-text-to-upper-or-lower-case-2094"></a><a name="index-capitalizing-words-2095"></a><a name="index-downcase_002dword-2096"></a><a name="index-upcase_002dword-2097"></a><a name="index-capitalize_002dword-2098"></a>  <kbd>M-l</kbd> (<code>downcase-word</code>) converts the word after point to
lower case, moving past it.  Thus, repeating <kbd>M-l</kbd> converts
successive words.  <kbd>M-u</kbd> (<code>upcase-word</code>) converts to all
capitals instead, while <kbd>M-c</kbd> (<code>capitalize-word</code>) puts the
first letter of the word into upper case and the rest into lower case. 
All these commands convert several words at once if given an argument. 
They are especially convenient for converting a large amount of text
from all upper case to mixed case, because you can move through the
text using <kbd>M-l</kbd>, <kbd>M-u</kbd> or <kbd>M-c</kbd> on each word as
appropriate, occasionally using <kbd>M-f</kbd> instead to skip a word.

   <p>When given a negative argument, the word case conversion commands apply
to the appropriate number of words before point, but do not move point. 
This is convenient when you have just typed a word in the wrong case: you
can give the case conversion command and continue typing.

   <p>If a word case conversion command is given in the middle of a word,
it applies only to the part of the word which follows point.  (This is
comparable to what <kbd>M-d</kbd> (<code>kill-word</code>) does.)  With a
negative argument, case conversion applies only to the part of the
word before point.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dl-2099"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002du-2100"></a><a name="index-downcase_002dregion-2101"></a><a name="index-upcase_002dregion-2102"></a>  The other case conversion commands are <kbd>C-x C-u</kbd>
(<code>upcase-region</code>) and <kbd>C-x C-l</kbd> (<code>downcase-region</code>), which
convert everything between point and mark to the specified case.  Point and
mark do not move.

   <p>The region case conversion commands <code>upcase-region</code> and
<code>downcase-region</code> are normally disabled.  This means that they ask
for confirmation if you try to use them.  When you confirm, you may
enable the command, which means it will not ask for confirmation again.

<h3 class="section">25.8 Text Mode</h3>

<p><a name="index-Text-mode-2103"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Text-2104"></a><a name="index-text_002dmode-2105"></a>
  Text mode is a major mode for editing files of text in a human
language.  Files which have names ending in the extension <samp><span class="file">.txt</span></samp>
are usually opened in Text mode (see <a href="#Choosing-Modes">Choosing Modes</a>).  To
explicitly switch to Text mode, type <kbd>M-x text-mode</kbd>.

   <p>In Text mode, only blank lines and page delimiters separate
paragraphs.  As a result, paragraphs can be indented, and adaptive
filling determines what indentation to use when filling a paragraph. 
See <a href="#Adaptive-Fill">Adaptive Fill</a>.

   <p><a name="index-TAB-_0040r_007b_0028Text-mode_0029_007d-2106"></a>  In Text mode, the &lt;TAB&gt; (<code>indent-for-tab-command</code>) command
usually inserts whitespace up to the next tab stop, instead of
indenting the current line.  See <a href="#Indentation">Indentation</a>, for details.

   <p>Text mode turns off the features concerned with comments except when
you explicitly invoke them.  It changes the syntax table so that
apostrophes are considered part of words (e.g., `<samp><span class="samp">don't</span></samp>' is
considered one word).  However, if a word starts with an apostrophe,
it is treated as a prefix for the purposes of capitalization
(e.g., <kbd>M-c</kbd> converts `<samp><span class="samp">'hello'</span></samp>' into `<samp><span class="samp">'Hello'</span></samp>', as
expected).

   <p><a name="index-Paragraph_002dIndent-Text-mode-2107"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Paragraph_002dIndent-Text-2108"></a><a name="index-paragraph_002dindent_002dtext_002dmode-2109"></a><a name="index-paragraph_002dindent_002dminor_002dmode-2110"></a>  If you indent the first lines of paragraphs, then you should use
Paragraph-Indent Text mode (<kbd>M-x paragraph-indent-text-mode</kbd>)
rather than Text mode.  In that mode, you do not need to have blank
lines between paragraphs, because the first-line indentation is
sufficient to start a paragraph; however paragraphs in which every
line is indented are not supported.  Use <kbd>M-x
paragraph-indent-minor-mode</kbd> to enable an equivalent minor mode for
situations where you shouldn't change the major mode&mdash;in mail
composition, for instance.

   <p><a name="index-M_002dTAB-_0040r_007b_0028Text-mode_0029_007d-2111"></a>  Text mode binds <kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> to <code>ispell-complete-word</code>. 
This command performs completion of the partial word in the buffer
before point, using the spelling dictionary as the space of possible
words.  See <a href="#Spelling">Spelling</a>.  If your window manager defines
<kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> to switch windows, you can type <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt;
&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> or <kbd>C-M-i</kbd> instead.

   <p><a name="index-text_002dmode_002dhook-2112"></a>  Entering Text mode runs the mode hook <code>text-mode-hook</code>
(see <a href="#Major-Modes">Major Modes</a>).

   <p>The following sections describe several major modes that are
<dfn>derived</dfn> from Text mode.  These derivatives share most of the
features of Text mode described above.  In particular, derivatives of
Text mode run <code>text-mode-hook</code> prior to running their own mode
hooks.

specialized for editing outlines.  It provides commands to navigate
between entries in the outline structure, and commands to make parts
of a buffer temporarily invisible, so that the outline structure may
be more easily viewed.  Type <kbd>M-x outline-mode</kbd> to switch to
Outline mode.  Entering Outline mode runs the hook
<code>text-mode-hook</code> followed by the hook <code>outline-mode-hook</code>
(see <a href="#Hooks">Hooks</a>).

   <p>When you use an Outline mode command to make a line invisible
(see <a href="#Outline-Visibility">Outline Visibility</a>), the line disappears from the screen.  An
ellipsis (three periods in a row) is displayed at the end of the
previous visible line, to indicate the hidden text.  Multiple
consecutive invisible lines produce just one ellipsis.

   <p>Editing commands that operate on lines, such as <kbd>C-n</kbd> and
<kbd>C-p</kbd>, treat the text of the invisible line as part of the
previous visible line.  Killing the ellipsis at the end of a visible
line really kills all the following invisible text associated with the
ellipsis.

   <p>Outline minor mode is a buffer-local minor mode which provides the
same commands as the major mode, Outline mode, but can be used in
conjunction with other major modes.  You can type <kbd>M-x
outline-minor-mode</kbd> to toggle Outline minor mode in the current
buffer, or use a file-local variable setting to enable it in a
specific file (see <a href="#File-Variables">File Variables</a>).

   <p><a name="index-C_002dc-_0040_0040-_0040r_007b_0028Outline-minor-mode_0029_007d-2120"></a>  The major mode, Outline mode, provides special key bindings on the
<kbd>C-c</kbd> prefix.  Outline minor mode provides similar bindings with
<kbd>C-c @</kbd> as the prefix; this is to reduce the conflicts with the
major mode's special commands.  (The variable
<code>outline-minor-mode-prefix</code> controls the prefix used.)

<h4 class="subsection">25.9.1 Format of Outlines</h4>

<p><a name="index-heading-lines-_0028Outline-mode_0029-2121"></a><a name="index-body-lines-_0028Outline-mode_0029-2122"></a>  Outline mode assumes that the lines in the buffer are of two types:
<dfn>heading lines</dfn> and <dfn>body lines</dfn>.  A heading line represents a
topic in the outline.  Heading lines start with one or more asterisk
(`<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>') characters; the number of asterisks determines the depth of
the heading in the outline structure.  Thus, a heading line with one
`<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' is a major topic; all the heading lines with two `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>'s
between it and the next one-`<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' heading are its subtopics; and so
on.  Any line that is not a heading line is a body line.  Body lines
belong with the preceding heading line.  Here is an example:

<pre class="example">     * Food
     This is the body,
     which says something about the topic of food.
     
     ** Delicious Food
     This is the body of the second-level header.
     
     ** Distasteful Food
     This could have
     a body too, with
     several lines.
     
     *** Dormitory Food
     
     * Shelter
     Another first-level topic with its header line.
</pre>
   <p>A heading line together with all following body lines is called
collectively an <dfn>entry</dfn>.  A heading line together with all following
deeper heading lines and their body lines is called a <dfn>subtree</dfn>.

   <p><a name="index-outline_002dregexp-2123"></a>  You can customize the criterion for distinguishing heading lines by
setting the variable <code>outline-regexp</code>.  (The recommended ways to
do this are in a major mode function or with a file local variable.) 
Any line whose beginning has a match for this regexp is considered a
heading line.  Matches that start within a line (not at the left
margin) do not count.

   <p>The length of the matching text determines the level of the heading;
longer matches make a more deeply nested level.  Thus, for example, if
a text formatter has commands `<samp><span class="samp">@chapter</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">@section</span></samp>' and
`<samp><span class="samp">@subsection</span></samp>' to divide the document into chapters and sections,
you could make those lines count as heading lines by setting
<code>outline-regexp</code> to `<samp><span class="samp">"@chap\\|@\\(sub\\)*section"</span></samp>'.  Note
the trick: the two words `<samp><span class="samp">chapter</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">section</span></samp>' are equally
long, but by defining the regexp to match only `<samp><span class="samp">chap</span></samp>' we ensure
that the length of the text matched on a chapter heading is shorter,
so that Outline mode will know that sections are contained in
chapters.  This works as long as no other command starts with
`<samp><span class="samp">@chap</span></samp>'.

   <p><a name="index-outline_002dlevel-2124"></a>  You can explicitly specify a rule for calculating the level of a
heading line by setting the variable <code>outline-level</code>.  The value
of <code>outline-level</code> should be a function that takes no arguments
and returns the level of the current heading.  The recommended ways to
set this variable are in a major mode command or with a file local
variable.

(<code>hide-entry</code>), which hides the body lines directly following the
current heading line, and <kbd>C-c C-e</kbd> (<code>show-entry</code>), which
reveals them.  Subheadings and their bodies are not affected.

(<code>show-subtree</code>) are more powerful.  They apply to the current
heading line's <dfn>subtree</dfn>: its body, all of its subheadings, both
direct and indirect, and all of their bodies.

current heading line as well as all the bodies in its subtree; the
subheadings themselves are left visible.  The command <kbd>C-c C-k</kbd>
(<code>show-branches</code>) reveals the subheadings, if they had previously
been hidden (e.g., by <kbd>C-c C-d</kbd>).  The command <kbd>C-c C-i</kbd>
(<code>show-children</code>) is a weaker version of this; it reveals just
the direct subheadings, i.e., those one level down.

(<code>hide-body</code>) makes all body lines invisible, so that you see
just the outline structure (as a special exception, it will not hide
lines at the top of the file, preceding the first header line, even
though these are technically body lines).  <kbd>C-c C-a</kbd>
(<code>show-all</code>) makes all lines visible.  <kbd>C-c C-q</kbd>
(<code>hide-sublevels</code>) hides all but the top level headings; with a
numeric argument <var>n</var>, it hides everything except the top <var>n</var>
levels of heading lines.

   <p><a name="Outline-Search"></a>
<a name="index-reveal_002dmode-2158"></a><a name="index-search_002dinvisible-2159"></a>  When incremental search finds text that is hidden by Outline mode,
it makes that part of the buffer visible.  If you exit the search at
that position, the text remains visible.  To toggle whether or not
an active incremental search can match hidden text, type <kbd>M-s i</kbd>. 
To change the default for future searches, customize the option
<code>search-invisible</code>.  (This option also affects how <code>query-replace</code>
and related functions treat hidden text, see <a href="#Query-Replace">Query Replace</a>.) 
You can also automatically make text visible as you navigate in it by
using Reveal mode (<kbd>M-x reveal-mode</kbd>), a buffer-local minor mode.

different windows.  To do this, you must create an indirect buffer using
<kbd>M-x make-indirect-buffer</kbd>.  The first argument of this command is
the existing outline buffer name, and its second argument is the name to
use for the new indirect buffer.  See <a href="#Indirect-Buffers">Indirect Buffers</a>.

   <p>Once the indirect buffer exists, you can display it in a window in the
normal fashion, with <kbd>C-x 4 b</kbd> or other Emacs commands.  The Outline
mode commands to show and hide parts of the text operate on each buffer
independently; as a result, each buffer can have its own view.  If you
want more than two views on the same outline, create additional indirect
buffers.

<h4 class="subsection">25.9.5 Folding Editing</h4>

<p><a name="index-folding-editing-2164"></a>  The Foldout package extends Outline mode and Outline minor mode with
folding commands.  The idea of folding is that you zoom in on a
nested portion of the outline, while hiding its relatives at higher
levels.

   <p>Consider an Outline mode buffer with all the text and subheadings under
level-1 headings hidden.  To look at what is hidden under one of these
headings, you could use <kbd>C-c C-e</kbd> (<kbd>M-x show-entry</kbd>) to expose
the body, or <kbd>C-c C-i</kbd> to expose the child (level-2) headings.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dz-2165"></a><a name="index-foldout_002dzoom_002dsubtree-2166"></a>  With Foldout, you use <kbd>C-c C-z</kbd> (<kbd>M-x foldout-zoom-subtree</kbd>). 
This exposes the body and child subheadings, and narrows the buffer so
that only the level-1<!-- /@w --> heading, the body and the level-2 headings are
visible.  Now to look under one of the level-2 headings, position the
cursor on it and use <kbd>C-c C-z</kbd> again.  This exposes the level-2 body
and its level-3 child subheadings and narrows the buffer again.  Zooming
in on successive subheadings can be done as much as you like.  A string
in the mode line shows how deep you've gone.

   <p>When zooming in on a heading, to see only the child subheadings specify
a numeric argument: <kbd>C-u C-c C-z</kbd>.  The number of levels of children
can be specified too (compare <kbd>M-x show-children</kbd>), e.g., <kbd>M-2
C-c C-z</kbd> exposes two levels of child subheadings.  Alternatively, the
body can be specified with a negative argument: <kbd>M-- C-c C-z</kbd>.  The
whole subtree can be expanded, similarly to <kbd>C-c C-s</kbd> (<kbd>M-x
show-subtree</kbd>), by specifying a zero argument: <kbd>M-0 C-c C-z</kbd>.

   <p>While you're zoomed in, you can still use Outline mode's exposure and
hiding functions without disturbing Foldout.  Also, since the buffer is
narrowed, global editing actions will only affect text under the
zoomed-in heading.  This is useful for restricting changes to a
particular chapter or section of your document.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dx-2167"></a><a name="index-foldout_002dexit_002dfold-2168"></a>  To unzoom (exit) a fold, use <kbd>C-c C-x</kbd> (<kbd>M-x foldout-exit-fold</kbd>). 
This hides all the text and subheadings under the top-level heading and
returns you to the previous view of the buffer.  Specifying a numeric
argument exits that many levels of folds.  Specifying a zero argument
exits all folds.

   <p>To cancel the narrowing of a fold without hiding the text and
subheadings, specify a negative argument.  For example, <kbd>M--2 C-c
C-x</kbd> exits two folds and leaves the text and subheadings exposed.

   <p>Foldout mode also provides mouse commands for entering and exiting
folds, and for showing and hiding text:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-M-mouse-1</kbd> zooms in on the heading clicked on<dd>
          <ul>
<li>single click: expose body. 
<li>double click: expose subheadings. 
<li>triple click: expose body and subheadings. 
<li>quad click: expose entire subtree. 
</ul>
     <br><dt><kbd>C-M-mouse-2</kbd> exposes text under the heading clicked on<dd>
          <ul>
<li>single click: expose body. 
<li>double click: expose subheadings. 
<li>triple click: expose body and subheadings. 
<li>quad click: expose entire subtree. 
</ul>
     <br><dt><kbd>C-M-mouse-3</kbd> hides text under the heading clicked on or exits fold<dd>
          <ul>
<li>single click: hide subtree. 
<li>double click: exit fold and hide text. 
<li>triple click: exit fold without hiding text. 
<li>quad click: exit all folds and hide text. 
</ul>
     </dl>

<!-- FIXME not marked as a user variable -->
<p><a name="index-foldout_002dmouse_002dmodifiers-2169"></a>  You can specify different modifier keys (instead of
<kbd>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-&lt;META&gt;-</kbd>) by setting <code>foldout-mouse-modifiers</code>; but if
you have already loaded the <samp><span class="file">foldout.el</span></samp> library, you must reload
it in order for this to take effect.

   <p>To use the Foldout package, you can type <kbd>M-x load-library
&lt;RET&gt; foldout &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>; or you can arrange for to do that
automatically by putting the following in your init file:

<a name="index-org_002dmode-2174"></a>  Org mode is a variant of Outline mode for using Emacs as an
organizer and/or authoring system.  Files with names ending in the
extension <samp><span class="file">.org</span></samp> are opened in Org mode (see <a href="#Choosing-Modes">Choosing Modes</a>). 
To explicitly switch to Org mode, type <kbd>M-x org-mode</kbd>.

   <p>In Org mode, as in Outline mode, each entry has a heading line that
starts with one or more `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' characters.  See <a href="#Outline-Format">Outline Format</a>. 
In addition, any line that begins with the `<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>' character is
treated as a comment.

   <p><a name="index-TAB-_0040r_007b_0028Org-Mode_0029_007d-2175"></a><a name="index-org_002dcycle-2176"></a>  Org mode provides commands for easily viewing and manipulating the
outline structure.  The simplest of these commands is &lt;TAB&gt;
(<code>org-cycle</code>).  If invoked on a heading line, it cycles through
the different visibility states of the subtree: (i) showing only that
heading line, (ii) showing only the heading line and the heading lines
of its direct children, if any, and (iii) showing the entire subtree. 
If invoked in a body line, the global binding for &lt;TAB&gt; is
executed.

   <p><a name="index-S_002dTAB-_0040r_007b_0028Org-Mode_0029_007d-2177"></a><a name="index-org_002dshifttab-2178"></a>  Typing <kbd>S-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> (<code>org-shifttab</code>) anywhere in an Org mode
buffer cycles the visibility of the entire outline structure, between
(i) showing only top-level heading lines, (ii) showing all heading
lines but no body lines, and (iii) showing everything.

   <p><a name="index-M_002d_003cup_003e-_0040r_007b_0028Org-Mode_0029_007d-2179"></a><a name="index-M_002d_003cdown_003e-_0040r_007b_0028Org-Mode_0029_007d-2180"></a><a name="index-M_002d_003cleft_003e-_0040r_007b_0028Org-Mode_0029_007d-2181"></a><a name="index-M_002d_003cright_003e-_0040r_007b_0028Org-Mode_0029_007d-2182"></a><a name="index-org_002dmetaup-2183"></a><a name="index-org_002dmetadown-2184"></a><a name="index-org_002dmetaleft-2185"></a><a name="index-org_002dmetaright-2186"></a>  You can move an entire entry up or down in the buffer, including its
body lines and subtree (if any), by typing <kbd>M-&lt;up&gt;</kbd>
(<code>org-metaup</code>) or <kbd>M-&lt;down&gt;</kbd> (<code>org-metadown</code>) on the
heading line.  Similarly, you can promote or demote a heading line
with <kbd>M-&lt;left&gt;</kbd> (<code>org-metaleft</code>) and <kbd>M-&lt;right&gt;</kbd>
(<code>org-metaright</code>).  These commands execute their global bindings
if invoked on a body line.

`<samp><span class="samp">TODO</span></samp>' to the heading line.  Typing <kbd>C-c C-t</kbd> again switches
the keyword to `<samp><span class="samp">DONE</span></samp>'; another <kbd>C-c C-t</kbd> removes the keyword
entirely, and so forth.  You can customize the keywords used by
<kbd>C-c C-t</kbd> via the variable <code>org-todo-keywords</code>.

typing <kbd>C-c C-s</kbd> (<code>org-schedule</code>) in the entry.  This prompts
for a date by popping up the Emacs Calendar (see <a href="#Calendar_002fDiary">Calendar/Diary</a>),
and then adds the tag `<samp><span class="samp">SCHEDULED</span></samp>', together with the selected
date, beneath the heading line.  The command <kbd>C-c C-d</kbd>
(<code>org-deadline</code>) has the same effect, except that it uses the tag

that file to the list of <dfn>agenda files</dfn> by typing <kbd>C-c [</kbd>
(<code>org-agenda-file-to-front</code>).  Org mode is designed to let you
easily maintain multiple agenda files, e.g., for organizing different
aspects of your life.  The list of agenda files is stored in the
variable <code>org-agenda-files</code>.

   <p><a name="index-org_002dagenda-2199"></a>  To view items coming from your agenda files, type <kbd>M-x
org-agenda</kbd>.  This command prompts for what you want to see: a list of

  Emacs provides special major modes for editing files written in
TeX and its related formats.  TeX is a powerful text formatter
written by Donald Knuth; like GNU Emacs, it is free software. 
LaTeX is a simplified input format for TeX, implemented using
TeX macros.  DocTeX is a special file format in which the
LaTeX sources are written, combining sources with documentation. 
SliTeX is an obsolete special form of LaTeX.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-10" name="fnd-10"><sup>10</sup></a>

   <p><a name="index-tex_002ddefault_002dmode-2218"></a>  TeX mode has four variants: Plain TeX mode, LaTeX mode,
DocTeX mode, and SliTeX mode.  These distinct major modes differ
only slightly, and are designed for editing the four different
formats.  Emacs selects the appropriate mode by looking at the
contents of the buffer.  (This is done by the <code>tex-mode</code> command,
which is normally called automatically when you visit a TeX-like
file.  See <a href="#Choosing-Modes">Choosing Modes</a>.)  If the contents are insufficient to
determine this, Emacs chooses the mode specified by the variable
<code>tex-default-mode</code>; its default value is <code>latex-mode</code>.  If
Emacs does not guess right, you can select the correct variant of
TeX mode using the command <kbd>M-x plain-tex-mode</kbd>, <kbd>M-x
latex-mode</kbd>, <kbd>M-x slitex-mode</kbd>, or <kbd>doctex-mode</kbd>.

   <p>The following sections document the features of TeX mode and its
variants.  There are several other TeX-related Emacs packages,
which are not documented in this manual:

     <ul>
<li>BibTeX mode is a major mode for BibTeX files, which are commonly
used for keeping bibliographic references for LaTeX documents.  For
more information, see the documentation string for the command
<code>bibtex-mode</code>.

     <li>The RefTeX package provides a minor mode which can be used with
LaTeX mode to manage bibliographic references. 
For more information, see the RefTeX Info manual, which is
distributed with Emacs.

     <li>The AUCTeX package provides more advanced features for editing
TeX and its related formats, including the ability to preview
TeX equations within Emacs buffers.  Unlike BibTeX mode and the
RefTeX package, AUCTeX is not distributed with Emacs by default. 
It can be downloaded via the Package Menu (see <a href="#Packages">Packages</a>); once
installed, see
the AUCTeX manual, which is included with the package.

</dl>

   <p><a name="index-tex_002dinsert_002dquote-2219"></a><a name="index-g_t_0022-_0040r_007b_0028_0040TeX_007b_007d-mode_0029_007d-2220"></a>  In TeX, the character `<samp><span class="samp">"</span></samp>' is not normally used; instead,
quotations begin with `<samp><span class="samp">``</span></samp>' and end with `<samp><span class="samp">''</span></samp>'.  TeX mode
therefore binds the <kbd>"</kbd> key to the <code>tex-insert-quote</code>
command.  This inserts `<samp><span class="samp">``</span></samp>' after whitespace or an open brace,
`<samp><span class="samp">"</span></samp>' after a backslash, and `<samp><span class="samp">''</span></samp>' after any other character.

   <p>As a special exception, if you type <kbd>"</kbd> when the text before
point is either `<samp><span class="samp">``</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">''</span></samp>', Emacs replaces that preceding
text with a single `<samp><span class="samp">"</span></samp>' character.  You can therefore type
<kbd>""</kbd> to insert `<samp><span class="samp">"</span></samp>', should you ever need to do so.  (You can
also use <kbd>C-q "</kbd> to insert this character.)

   <p>In TeX mode, `<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>' has a special syntax code which attempts to
understand the way TeX math mode delimiters match.  When you insert a
`<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>' that is meant to exit math mode, the position of the matching
`<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>' that entered math mode is displayed for a second.  This is the
same feature that displays the open brace that matches a close brace that
is inserted.  However, there is no way to tell whether a `<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>' enters
math mode or leaves it; so when you insert a `<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>' that enters math
mode, the previous `<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>' position is shown as if it were a match, even
though they are actually unrelated.

   <p><a name="index-tex_002dinsert_002dbraces-2221"></a><a name="index-C_002dc-_0040_007b-_0040r_007b_0028_0040TeX_007b_007d-mode_0029_007d-2222"></a><a name="index-up_002dlist-2223"></a><a name="index-C_002dc-_0040_007d-_0040r_007b_0028_0040TeX_007b_007d-mode_0029_007d-2224"></a>  TeX uses braces as delimiters that must match.  Some users prefer
to keep braces balanced at all times, rather than inserting them
singly.  Use <kbd>C-c {</kbd> (<code>tex-insert-braces</code>) to insert a pair of
braces.  It leaves point between the two braces so you can insert the
text that belongs inside.  Afterward, use the command <kbd>C-c }</kbd>
(<code>up-list</code>) to move forward past the close brace.

   <p><a name="index-tex_002dvalidate_002dregion-2225"></a><a name="index-tex_002dterminate_002dparagraph-2226"></a><a name="index-C_002dj-_0040r_007b_0028_0040TeX_007b_007d-mode_0029_007d-2227"></a>  There are two commands for checking the matching of braces. 
<kbd>C-j</kbd> (<code>tex-terminate-paragraph</code>) checks the paragraph before
point, and inserts two newlines to start a new paragraph.  It outputs
a message in the echo area if any mismatch is found.  <kbd>M-x
tex-validate-region</kbd> checks a region, paragraph by paragraph.  The
errors are listed in an <samp><span class="file">*Occur*</span></samp> buffer; you can use the usual
Occur mode commands in that buffer, such as <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>, to visit a
particular mismatch (see <a href="#Other-Repeating-Search">Other Repeating Search</a>).

   <p>Note that Emacs commands count square brackets and parentheses in
TeX mode, not just braces.  This is not strictly correct for the
purpose of checking TeX syntax.  However, parentheses and square
brackets are likely to be used in text as matching delimiters, and it
is useful for the various motion commands and automatic match display
to work with them.

<h4 class="subsection">25.11.2 LaTeX Editing Commands</h4>

<p>LaTeX mode provides a few extra features not applicable to plain
TeX:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-c C-o</kbd><dd>Insert `<samp><span class="samp">\begin</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">\end</span></samp>' for LaTeX block and position
point on a line between them (<code>tex-latex-block</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-c C-e</kbd><dd>Close the innermost LaTeX block not yet closed
(<code>tex-close-latex-block</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-tex_002dlatex_002dblock-2228"></a><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002do-_0040r_007b_0028_0040LaTeX_007b_007d-mode_0029_007d-2229"></a>  In LaTeX input, `<samp><span class="samp">\begin</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">\end</span></samp>' tags are used to
group blocks of text.  To insert a block, type <kbd>C-c C-o</kbd>
(<code>tex-latex-block</code>).  This prompts for a block type, and inserts
the appropriate matching `<samp><span class="samp">\begin</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">\end</span></samp>' tags, leaving a
blank line between the two and moving point there.

   <p><a name="index-latex_002dblock_002dnames-2230"></a>  When entering the block type argument to <kbd>C-c C-o</kbd>, you can use
the usual completion commands (see <a href="#Completion">Completion</a>).  The default
completion list contains the standard LaTeX block types.  If you
want additional block types for completion, customize the list
variable <code>latex-block-names</code>.

   <p><a name="index-tex_002dclose_002dlatex_002dblock-2231"></a><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002de-_0040r_007b_0028_0040LaTeX_007b_007d-mode_0029_007d-2232"></a><a name="index-latex_002delectric_002denv_002dpair_002dmode-2233"></a>  In LaTeX input, `<samp><span class="samp">\begin</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">\end</span></samp>' tags must balance. 
You can use <kbd>C-c C-e</kbd> (<code>tex-close-latex-block</code>) to insert an
`<samp><span class="samp">\end</span></samp>' tag which matches the last unmatched `<samp><span class="samp">\begin</span></samp>'.  It
also indents the `<samp><span class="samp">\end</span></samp>' to match the corresponding `<samp><span class="samp">\begin</span></samp>',
and inserts a newline after the `<samp><span class="samp">\end</span></samp>' tag if point is at the
beginning of a line.  The minor mode <code>latex-electric-env-pair-mode</code>
automatically inserts an `<samp><span class="samp">\end</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">\begin</span></samp>' tag for you
when you type the corresponding one.

   <p><a name="index-tex_002dbuffer-2234"></a><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002db-_0040r_007b_0028_0040TeX_007b_007d-mode_0029_007d-2235"></a><a name="index-tex_002dview-2236"></a><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dv-_0040r_007b_0028_0040TeX_007b_007d-mode_0029_007d-2237"></a><a name="index-tex_002dprint-2238"></a><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dp-_0040r_007b_0028_0040TeX_007b_007d-mode_0029_007d-2239"></a>  To pass the current buffer through TeX, type <kbd>C-c C-b</kbd>
(<code>tex-buffer</code>).  The formatted output goes in a temporary file,
normally a <samp><span class="file">.dvi</span></samp> file.  Afterwards, you can type <kbd>C-c C-v</kbd>
(<code>tex-view</code>) to launch an external program, such as
<samp><span class="command">xdvi</span></samp>, to view this output file.  You can also type <kbd>C-c
C-p</kbd> (<code>tex-print</code>) to print a hardcopy of the output file.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040env_007bTEXINPUTS_007d-environment-variable-2240"></a><a name="index-tex_002ddirectory-2241"></a>  By default, <kbd>C-c C-b</kbd> runs TeX in the current directory.  The
output of TeX also goes in this directory.  To run TeX in a
different directory, change the variable <code>tex-directory</code> to the
desired directory name.  If your environment variable <samp><span class="env">TEXINPUTS</span></samp>
contains relative directory names, or if your files contains
`<samp><span class="samp">\input</span></samp>' commands with relative file names, then
<code>tex-directory</code> <em>must</em> be <code>"."</code> or you will get the
wrong results.  Otherwise, it is safe to specify some other directory,
such as <code>"/tmp"</code>.

   <p><a name="index-tex_002drun_002dcommand-2242"></a><a name="index-latex_002drun_002dcommand-2243"></a><a name="index-tex_002ddvi_002dview_002dcommand-2244"></a><a name="index-tex_002ddvi_002dprint_002dcommand-2245"></a><a name="index-tex_002dprint_002dfile_002dextension-2246"></a>  The buffer's TeX variant determines what shell command <kbd>C-c
C-b</kbd> actually runs.  In Plain TeX mode, it is specified by the
variable <code>tex-run-command</code>, which defaults to <code>"tex"</code>.  In
LaTeX mode, it is specified by <code>latex-run-command</code>, which
defaults to <code>"latex"</code>.  The shell command that <kbd>C-c C-v</kbd> runs
to view the <samp><span class="file">.dvi</span></samp> output is determined by the variable
<code>tex-dvi-view-command</code>, regardless of the TeX variant.  The
shell command that <kbd>C-c C-p</kbd> runs to print the output is
determined by the variable <code>tex-dvi-print-command</code>.  The variable
<code>tex-print-file-extension</code> can be set to the required file
extension for viewing and printing TeX-compiled files.  For
example, you can set it to <samp><span class="file">.pdf</span></samp>, and update
<code>tex-dvi-view-command</code> and <code>tex-dvi-print-command</code>
accordingly.

   <p>Normally, Emacs automatically appends the output file name to the
shell command strings described in the preceding paragraph.  For
example, if <code>tex-dvi-view-command</code> is <code>"xdvi"</code>, <kbd>C-c
C-v</kbd> runs <samp><span class="command">xdvi </span><var>output-file-name</var></samp>.  In some cases,
however, the file name needs to be embedded in the command, e.g., if
you need to provide the file name as an argument to one command whose
output is piped to another.  You can specify where to put the file
name with `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' in the command string.  For example,

<pre class="example">     (setq tex-dvi-print-command "dvips -f * | lpr")
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-tex_002dkill_002djob-2247"></a><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dk-_0040r_007b_0028_0040TeX_007b_007d-mode_0029_007d-2248"></a><a name="index-tex_002drecenter_002doutput_002dbuffer-2249"></a><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dl-_0040r_007b_0028_0040TeX_007b_007d-mode_0029_007d-2250"></a>  The terminal output from TeX, including any error messages,
appears in a buffer called <samp><span class="file">*tex-shell*</span></samp>.  If TeX gets an
error, you can switch to this buffer and feed it input (this works as
in Shell mode; see <a href="#Interactive-Shell">Interactive Shell</a>).  Without switching to this
buffer you can scroll it so that its last line is visible by typing
<kbd>C-c C-l</kbd>.

   <p>Type <kbd>C-c C-k</kbd> (<code>tex-kill-job</code>) to kill the TeX process if
you see that its output is no longer useful.  Using <kbd>C-c C-b</kbd> or
<kbd>C-c C-r</kbd> also kills any TeX process still running.

   <p><a name="index-tex_002dregion-2251"></a><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dr-_0040r_007b_0028_0040TeX_007b_007d-mode_0029_007d-2252"></a>  You can also pass an arbitrary region through TeX by typing
<kbd>C-c C-r</kbd> (<code>tex-region</code>).  This is tricky, however, because
most files of TeX input contain commands at the beginning to set
parameters and define macros, without which no later part of the file
will format correctly.  To solve this problem, <kbd>C-c C-r</kbd> allows
you to designate a part of the file as containing essential commands;
it is included before the specified region as part of the input to
TeX.  The designated part of the file is called the <dfn>header</dfn>.

   <p><a name="index-header-_0028_0040TeX_007b_007d-mode_0029-2253"></a>  To indicate the bounds of the header in Plain TeX mode, you insert two
special strings in the file.  Insert `<samp><span class="samp">%**start of header</span></samp>' before the
header, and `<samp><span class="samp">%**end of header</span></samp>' after it.  Each string must appear
entirely on one line, but there may be other text on the line before or
after.  The lines containing the two strings are included in the header. 
If `<samp><span class="samp">%**start of header</span></samp>' does not appear within the first 100 lines of
the buffer, <kbd>C-c C-r</kbd> assumes that there is no header.

   <p>In LaTeX mode, the header begins with `<samp><span class="samp">\documentclass</span></samp>' or
`<samp><span class="samp">\documentstyle</span></samp>' and ends with `<samp><span class="samp">\begin{document}</span></samp>'.  These
are commands that LaTeX requires you to use in any case, so nothing
special needs to be done to identify the header.

   <p><a name="index-tex_002dfile-2254"></a><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002df-_0040r_007b_0028_0040TeX_007b_007d-mode_0029_007d-2255"></a>  The commands (<code>tex-buffer</code>) and (<code>tex-region</code>) do all of their
work in a temporary directory, and do not have available any of the auxiliary
files needed by TeX for cross-references; these commands are generally
not suitable for running the final copy in which all of the cross-references
need to be correct.

   <p>When you want the auxiliary files for cross references, use <kbd>C-c
C-f</kbd> (<code>tex-file</code>) which runs TeX on the current buffer's file,
in that file's directory.  Before running TeX, it offers to save any
modified buffers.  Generally, you need to use (<code>tex-file</code>) twice to
get the cross-references right.

   <p><a name="index-tex_002dstart_002doptions-2256"></a>  The value of the variable <code>tex-start-options</code> specifies
options for the TeX run.

   <p><a name="index-tex_002dstart_002dcommands-2257"></a>  The value of the variable <code>tex-start-commands</code> specifies TeX
commands for starting TeX.  The default value causes TeX to run
in nonstop mode.  To run TeX interactively, set the variable to
<code>""</code>.

   <p><a name="index-tex_002dmain_002dfile-2258"></a>  Large TeX documents are often split into several files&mdash;one main
file, plus subfiles.  Running TeX on a subfile typically does not
work; you have to run it on the main file.  In order to make
<code>tex-file</code> useful when you are editing a subfile, you can set the
variable <code>tex-main-file</code> to the name of the main file.  Then
<code>tex-file</code> runs TeX on that file.

   <p>The most convenient way to use <code>tex-main-file</code> is to specify it
in a local variable list in each of the subfiles.  See <a href="#File-Variables">File Variables</a>.

   <p><a name="index-tex_002dbibtex_002dfile-2259"></a><a name="index-C_002dc-TAB-_0040r_007b_0028_0040TeX_007b_007d-mode_0029_007d-2260"></a><a name="index-tex_002dbibtex_002dcommand-2261"></a>  For LaTeX files, you can use BibTeX to process the auxiliary
file for the current buffer's file.  BibTeX looks up bibliographic
citations in a data base and prepares the cited references for the
bibliography section.  The command <kbd>C-c &lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>
(<code>tex-bibtex-file</code>) runs the shell command
(<code>tex-bibtex-command</code>) to produce a `<samp><span class="samp">.bbl</span></samp>' file for the
current buffer's file.  Generally, you need to do <kbd>C-c C-f</kbd>
(<code>tex-file</code>) once to generate the `<samp><span class="samp">.aux</span></samp>' file, then do
<kbd>C-c &lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> (<code>tex-bibtex-file</code>), and then repeat <kbd>C-c C-f</kbd>
(<code>tex-file</code>) twice more to get the cross-references correct.

   <p><a name="index-tex_002dcompile-2262"></a><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dc-_0040r_007b_0028_0040TeX_007b_007d-mode_0029_007d-2263"></a>  To invoke some other compilation program on the current TeX
buffer, type <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> (<code>tex-compile</code>).  This command knows
how to pass arguments to many common programs, including
<samp><span class="file">pdflatex</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">yap</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">xdvi</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="file">dvips</span></samp>.  You can
select your desired compilation program using the standard completion
keys (see <a href="#Completion">Completion</a>).

  The major modes for SGML and HTML provide indentation support and
commands for operating on tags.  HTML mode is a slightly customized
variant of SGML mode.

This command asks you for a tag name and for the attribute values,
then inserts both the opening tag and the closing tag, leaving point
between them.

     <p>With a prefix argument <var>n</var>, the command puts the tag around the
<var>n</var> words already present in the buffer after point.  Whenever a
region is active, it puts the tag around the region (when Transient
Mark mode is off, it does this when a numeric argument of &minus;1 is
supplied.)

is a powerful major mode that can recognize many existing XML schema
and use them to provide completion of XML elements via
<kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>, as well as on-the-fly XML
validation with error highlighting.  To enable nXML mode in an
existing buffer, type <kbd>M-x nxml-mode</kbd>, or, equivalently, <kbd>M-x
xml-mode</kbd>.  Emacs uses nXML mode for files which have the extension
<samp><span class="file">.xml</span></samp>.  For XHTML files, which have the extension <samp><span class="file">.xhtml</span></samp>,
Emacs uses HTML mode by default; you can make it use nXML mode by
customizing the variable <code>auto-mode-alist</code> (see <a href="#Choosing-Modes">Choosing Modes</a>). 
nXML mode is described in an Info manual, which is distributed with
Emacs.

   <p><a name="index-sgml_002dxml_002dmode-2307"></a>  You may choose to use the less powerful SGML mode for editing XML,
since XML is a strict subset of SGML.  To enable SGML mode in an
existing buffer, type <kbd>M-x sgml-mode</kbd>.  On enabling SGML mode,
Emacs examines the buffer to determine whether it is XML; if so, it
sets the variable <code>sgml-xml-mode</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> value. 
This causes SGML mode's tag insertion commands, described above, to
always insert explicit closing tags as well.

time you type &lt;RET&gt; to end a line containing an nroff command that
opens a kind of grouping, the nroff command to close that grouping is
automatically inserted on the following line.

   <p>If you use Outline minor mode with Nroff mode (see <a href="#Outline-Mode">Outline Mode</a>), heading lines are lines of the form `<samp><span class="samp">.H</span></samp>' followed by a

  Enriched mode is a minor mode for editing formatted text files in a
WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) fashion.  When Enriched
mode is enabled, you can apply various formatting properties to the
text in the buffer, such as fonts and colors; upon saving the buffer,
those properties are saved together with the text, using the MIME
`<samp><span class="samp">text/enriched</span></samp>' file format.

   <p>Enriched mode is typically used with Text mode (see <a href="#Text-Mode">Text Mode</a>). 
It is <em>not</em> compatible with Font Lock mode, which is used by many
major modes, including most programming language modes, for syntax
highlighting (see <a href="#Font-Lock">Font Lock</a>).  Unlike Enriched mode, Font Lock
mode assigns text properties automatically, based on the current
buffer contents; those properties are not saved to disk.

   <p>The file <samp><span class="file">enriched.txt</span></samp> in Emacs's <code>data-directory</code>
serves as an example of the features of Enriched mode.

<h4 class="subsection">25.14.1 Enriched Mode</h4>

<p>Enriched mode is a buffer-local minor mode (see <a href="#Minor-Modes">Minor Modes</a>). 
When you visit a file that has been saved in the `<samp><span class="samp">text/enriched</span></samp>'
format, Emacs automatically enables Enriched mode, and applies the
formatting information in the file to the buffer text.  When you save
a buffer with Enriched mode enabled, it is saved using the
`<samp><span class="samp">text/enriched</span></samp>' format, including the formatting information.

   <p><a name="index-enriched_002dmode-2324"></a>  To create a new file of formatted text, visit the nonexistent file
and type <kbd>M-x enriched-mode</kbd>.  This command actually toggles
Enriched mode.  With a prefix argument, it enables Enriched mode if
the argument is positive, and disables Enriched mode otherwise.  If
you disable Enriched mode, Emacs no longer saves the buffer using the
`<samp><span class="samp">text/enriched</span></samp>' format; any formatting properties that have been
added to the buffer remain in the buffer, but they are not saved to
disk.

   <p><a name="index-enriched_002dtranslations-2325"></a>  Enriched mode does not save all Emacs text properties, only those
specified in the variable <code>enriched-translations</code>.  These include
properties for fonts, colors, indentation, and justification.

   <p><a name="index-format_002ddecode_002dbuffer-2326"></a>  If you visit a file and Emacs fails to recognize that it is in the
`<samp><span class="samp">text/enriched</span></samp>' format, type <kbd>M-x format-decode-buffer</kbd>. 
This command prompts for a file format, and re-reads the file in that
format.  Specifying the `<samp><span class="samp">text/enriched</span></samp>' format automatically
enables Enriched mode.

   <p>To view a `<samp><span class="samp">text/enriched</span></samp>' file in raw form (as plain text with
markup tags rather than formatted text), use <kbd>M-x
find-file-literally</kbd> (see <a href="#Visiting">Visiting</a>).

   <p>See <a href="elisp.html#Format-Conversion">Format Conversion</a>, for details of how Emacs recognizes and converts
file formats like `<samp><span class="samp">text/enriched</span></samp>'.  See <a href="elisp.html#Text-Properties">Text Properties</a>, for more information about
text properties.

<a name="index-use_002dhard_002dnewlines-2330"></a>  In Enriched mode, Emacs distinguishes between two different kinds of
newlines, <dfn>hard</dfn> newlines and <dfn>soft</dfn> newlines.  You can also
enable or disable this feature in other buffers, by typing <kbd>M-x
use-hard-newlines</kbd>.

   <p>Hard newlines are used to separate paragraphs, or anywhere there
needs to be a line break regardless of how the text is filled; soft
newlines are used for filling.  The &lt;RET&gt; (<code>newline</code>) and
<kbd>C-o</kbd> (<code>open-line</code>) commands insert hard newlines.  The fill
commands, including Auto Fill (see <a href="#Auto-Fill">Auto Fill</a>), insert only soft
newlines and delete only soft newlines, leaving hard newlines alone.

<!-- FIXME: I don't see 'unfilled' in that node.  -xfq -->
<p>Thus, when editing with Enriched mode, you should not use &lt;RET&gt;
or <kbd>C-o</kbd> to break lines in the middle of filled paragraphs.  Use
Auto Fill mode or explicit fill commands (see <a href="#Fill-Commands">Fill Commands</a>)
instead.  Use &lt;RET&gt; or <kbd>C-o</kbd> where line breaks should always
remain, such as in tables and lists.  For such lines, you may also
want to set the justification style to <code>unfilled</code>
(see <a href="#Enriched-Justification">Enriched Justification</a>).

<p class="noindent">These command are also available via the Text Properties menu.

   <p>A self-inserting character normally inherits the face properties

buffer.  If you use one of the above commands to specify the face for
the next self-inserting character, that character will not inherit the
faces properties from the preceding character, but it will still
inherit other text properties.

   <p>Enriched mode defines two additional faces: <code>excerpt</code> and
<code>fixed</code>.  These correspond to codes used in the text/enriched
file format.  The <code>excerpt</code> face is intended for quotations; by
default, it appears the same as <code>italic</code>.  The <code>fixed</code> face
specifies fixed-width text; by default, it appears the same as
<code>bold</code>.

<dl><dt><code>Indent More</code><dd>Indent the region by 4 columns (<code>increase-left-margin</code>).  In
Enriched mode, this command is also available on <kbd>C-x &lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>; if
you supply a numeric argument, that says how many columns to add to the
margin (a negative argument reduces the number of columns).

  A <dfn>table</dfn> consists of a rectangular text area which is divided
into <dfn>cells</dfn>.  Each cell must be at least one character wide and
one character high, not counting its border lines.  A cell can be
subdivided into more cells, but they cannot overlap.

   <p>Cell border lines are drawn with three special characters, specified
by the following variables:

     
<a name="index-table_002dcell_002dvertical_002dchar-2376"></a>
<dl><dt><code>table-cell-vertical-char</code><dd>The character used for vertical lines.  The default is `<samp><span class="samp">|</span></samp>'.

<a name="index-table_002dinsert-2381"></a>  To create a text-based table from scratch, type <kbd>M-x
table-insert</kbd>.  This command prompts for the number of table columns,
the number of table rows, cell width and cell height.  The cell width
and cell height do not include the cell borders; each can be specified
as a single integer (which means each cell is given the same
width/height), or as a sequence of integers separated by spaces or
commas (which specify the width/height of the individual table
columns/rows, counting from left to right for table columns and from
top to bottom for table rows).  The specified table is then inserted
at point.

   <p>The table inserted by <kbd>M-x table-insert</kbd> contains special text
properties, which tell Emacs to treat it specially as a text-based
table.  If you save the buffer to a file and visit it again later,
those properties are lost, and the table appears to Emacs as an
ordinary piece of text.  See the next section, for how to convert it
back into a table.

table-backward-cell</kbd> move point from the current cell to an adjacent
cell.  The order is cyclic: when point is in the last cell of a table,
<kbd>M-x table-forward-cell</kbd> moves to the first cell.  Likewise, when
point is on the first cell, <kbd>M-x table-backward-cell</kbd> moves to the
last cell.

   <p><a name="index-table_002dspan_002dcell-2393"></a>  <kbd>M-x table-span-cell</kbd> prompts for a direction&mdash;right, left,
above, or below&mdash;and merges the current cell with the adjacent cell
in that direction.  This command signals an error if the merge would
result in an illegitimate cell layout.

   <p><a name="index-table_002dsplit_002dcell-2394"></a><a name="index-table_002dsplit_002dcell_002dvertically-2395"></a><a name="index-table_002dsplit_002dcell_002dhorizontally-2396"></a><a name="index-text_002dbased-tables_002c-splitting-cells-2397"></a><a name="index-splitting-table-cells-2398"></a>  <kbd>M-x table-split-cell</kbd> splits the current cell vertically or
horizontally, prompting for the direction with the minibuffer.  To
split in a specific direction, use <kbd>M-x
table-split-cell-vertically</kbd> and <kbd>M-x
table-split-cell-horizontally</kbd>.  When splitting vertically, the old
cell contents are automatically split between the two new cells.  When
splitting horizontally, you are prompted for how to divide the cell
contents, if the cell is non-empty; the options are `<samp><span class="samp">split</span></samp>'
(divide the contents at point), `<samp><span class="samp">left</span></samp>' (put all the contents in

<h4 class="subsection">25.15.5 Cell Justification</h4>

<p><a name="index-justification-in-text_002dbased-tables-2403"></a>
  The command <kbd>M-x table-justify</kbd> imposes <dfn>justification</dfn> on
one or more cells in a text-based table.  Justification determines how
the text in the cell is aligned, relative to the edges of the cell. 
Each cell in a table can be separately justified.

   <p><a name="index-table_002djustify-2404"></a>  <kbd>M-x table-justify</kbd> first prompts for what to justify; the
options are `<samp><span class="samp">cell</span></samp>' (just the current cell), `<samp><span class="samp">column</span></samp>' (all
cells in the current table column) and `<samp><span class="samp">row</span></samp>' (all cells in the
current table row).  The command then prompts for the justification
style; the options are <code>left</code>, <code>center</code>, <code>right</code>,
<code>top</code>, <code>middle</code>, <code>bottom</code>, or <code>none</code> (meaning no
vertical justification).

   <p>Horizontal and vertical justification styles are specified
independently, and both types can be in effect simultaneously; for
instance, you can call <kbd>M-x table-justify</kbd> twice, once to specify
<code>right</code> justification and once to specify <code>bottom</code>
justification, to align the contents of a cell to the bottom right.

   <p><a name="index-table_002ddetect_002dcell_002dalignment-2405"></a>  The justification style is stored in the buffer as a text property,
and is lost when you kill the buffer or exit Emacs.  However, the
table recognition commands, such as <kbd>M-x table-recognize</kbd>
(see <a href="#Table-Recognition">Table Recognition</a>), attempt to determine and re-apply each
cell's justification style, by examining its contents.  To disable
this feature, change the variable <code>table-detect-cell-alignment</code>
to <code>nil</code>.

<a name="index-table_002dinsert_002drow-2407"></a>  <kbd>M-x table-insert-row</kbd> inserts a row of cells before the current
table row.  The current row, together with point, is pushed down past
the new row.  To insert a row after the last row at the bottom of a
table, invoke this command with point below the table, just below the
bottom edge.  You can insert more than one row at a time by using a
numeric prefix argument.

<!-- A numeric prefix argument specifies the number of rows to insert. -->
<p><a name="index-table_002dinsert_002dcolumn-2408"></a>  Similarly, <kbd>M-x table-insert-column</kbd> inserts a column of cells
to the left of the current table column.  To insert a column to the
right side of the rightmost column, invoke this command with point to
the right of the rightmost column, outside the table.  A numeric
prefix argument specifies the number of columns to insert.

   <p><a name="index-deleting-rows-and-column-in-text_002dbased-tables-2409"></a>  <kbd>M-x table-delete-column</kbd> deletes the column of cells at point. 
Similarly, <kbd>M-x table-delete-row</kbd> deletes the row of cells at
point.  A numeric prefix argument to either command specifies the

<p><a name="index-text-to-table-2410"></a><a name="index-table-to-text-2411"></a>
<a name="index-table_002dcapture-2412"></a>  The command <kbd>M-x table-capture</kbd> captures plain text in a region
and turns it into a table.  Unlike <kbd>M-x table-recognize</kbd>
(see <a href="#Table-Recognition">Table Recognition</a>), the original text does not need to have a
table appearance; it only needs to have a logical table-like
structure.

   <p>For example, suppose we have the following numbers, which are
divided into three lines and separated horizontally by commas:

<pre class="example">     1, 2, 3, 4
     5, 6, 7, 8
     , 9, 10
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Invoking <kbd>M-x table-capture</kbd> on that text produces this table:

<pre class="example">     +-----+-----+-----+-----+
     |1    |2    |3    |4    |
     +-----+-----+-----+-----+
     |5    |6    |7    |8    |
     +-----+-----+-----+-----+
     |     |9    |10   |     |
     +-----+-----+-----+-----+
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-table_002drelease-2413"></a>  <kbd>M-x table-release</kbd> does the opposite: it converts a table back
to plain text, removing its cell borders.

   <p>One application of this pair of commands is to edit a text in
layout.  Look at the following three paragraphs (the latter two are
indented with header lines):

<pre class="example">     table-capture is a powerful command.
     Here are some things it can do:

   <p class="noindent">Applying <code>table-capture</code> to a region containing the above text,
with empty strings for the column and row delimiter regexps, creates a
table with a single cell like the following one.

<p><a name="index-table-dimensions-2414"></a><a name="index-table_002dquery_002ddimension-2415"></a>  The command <code>table-query-dimension</code> reports the layout of the

</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This indicates that the current cell is 21 characters wide and 6 lines

<h3 class="section">25.16 Two-Column Editing</h3>

<p><a name="index-two_002dcolumn-editing-2419"></a><a name="index-splitting-columns-2420"></a><a name="index-columns_002c-splitting-2421"></a>
  Two-column mode lets you conveniently edit two side-by-side columns
of text.  It uses two side-by-side windows, each showing its own
buffer.  There are three ways to enter two-column mode:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>&lt;F2&gt; 2</kbd> or <kbd>C-x 6 2</kbd><dd><a name="index-F2-2-2422"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-6-2-2423"></a><a name="index-g_t2C_002dtwo_002dcolumns-2424"></a>Enter two-column mode with the current buffer on the left, and on the
right, a buffer whose name is based on the current buffer's name
(<code>2C-two-columns</code>).  If the right-hand buffer doesn't already
exist, it starts out empty; the current buffer's contents are not
changed.

     <p>This command is appropriate when the current buffer is empty or contains
just one column and you want to add another column.

     <br><dt><kbd>&lt;F2&gt; s</kbd> or <kbd>C-x 6 s</kbd><dd><a name="index-F2-s-2425"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-6-s-2426"></a><a name="index-g_t2C_002dsplit-2427"></a>Split the current buffer, which contains two-column text, into two
buffers, and display them side by side (<code>2C-split</code>).  The current
buffer becomes the left-hand buffer, but the text in the right-hand
column is moved into the right-hand buffer.  The current column
specifies the split point.  Splitting starts with the current line and
continues to the end of the buffer.

     <p>This command is appropriate when you have a buffer that already contains
two-column text, and you wish to separate the columns temporarily.

     <br><dt><kbd>&lt;F2&gt; b </kbd><var>buffer</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dt><kbd>C-x 6 b </kbd><var>buffer</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-F2-b-2428"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-6-b-2429"></a><a name="index-g_t2C_002dassociate_002dbuffer-2430"></a>Enter two-column mode using the current buffer as the left-hand buffer,
and using buffer <var>buffer</var> as the right-hand buffer
(<code>2C-associate-buffer</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><kbd>&lt;F2&gt; s</kbd> or <kbd>C-x 6 s</kbd> looks for a column separator, which
is a string that appears on each line between the two columns.  You can
specify the width of the separator with a numeric argument to
<kbd>&lt;F2&gt; s</kbd>; that many characters, before point, constitute the
separator string.  By default, the width is 1, so the column separator
is the character before point.

   <p>When a line has the separator at the proper place, <kbd>&lt;F2&gt; s</kbd>
puts the text after the separator into the right-hand buffer, and
deletes the separator.  Lines that don't have the column separator at
the proper place remain unsplit; they stay in the left-hand buffer, and
the right-hand buffer gets an empty line to correspond.  (This is the
way to write a line that spans both columns while in two-column
mode: write it in the left-hand buffer, and put an empty line in the
right-hand buffer.)

   <p><a name="index-F2-RET-2431"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-6-RET-2432"></a><a name="index-g_t2C_002dnewline-2433"></a>  The command <kbd>C-x 6 &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> or <kbd>&lt;F2&gt; &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
(<code>2C-newline</code>) inserts a newline in each of the two buffers at
corresponding positions.  This is the easiest way to add a new line to
the two-column text while editing it in split buffers.

   <p><a name="index-F2-1-2434"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-6-1-2435"></a><a name="index-g_t2C_002dmerge-2436"></a>  When you have edited both buffers as you wish, merge them with
<kbd>&lt;F2&gt; 1</kbd> or <kbd>C-x 6 1</kbd> (<code>2C-merge</code>).  This copies the
text from the right-hand buffer as a second column in the other buffer. 
To go back to two-column editing, use <kbd>&lt;F2&gt; s</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-F2-d-2437"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-6-d-2438"></a><a name="index-g_t2C_002ddissociate-2439"></a>  Use <kbd>&lt;F2&gt; d</kbd> or <kbd>C-x 6 d</kbd> to dissociate the two buffers,
leaving each as it stands (<code>2C-dissociate</code>).  If the other buffer,
the one not current when you type <kbd>&lt;F2&gt; d</kbd>, is empty,
<kbd>&lt;F2&gt; d</kbd> kills it.

<h3 class="section">26.1 Major Modes for Programming Languages</h3>

<p><a name="index-modes-for-programming-languages-2443"></a>
  Emacs has specialized major modes (see <a href="#Major-Modes">Major Modes</a>) for many
programming languages.  A programming language mode typically
specifies the syntax of expressions, the customary rules for
indentation, how to do syntax highlighting for the language, and how
to find the beginning or end of a function definition.  It often has
features for compiling and debugging programs as well.  The major mode
for each language is named after the language; for instance, the major
mode for the C programming language is <code>c-mode</code>.

   <p><a name="index-Perl-mode-2444"></a><a name="index-Icon-mode-2445"></a><a name="index-Makefile-mode-2446"></a><a name="index-Tcl-mode-2447"></a><a name="index-CPerl-mode-2448"></a><a name="index-DSSSL-mode-2449"></a><a name="index-Octave-mode-2450"></a><a name="index-Metafont-mode-2451"></a><a name="index-Modula2-mode-2452"></a><a name="index-Prolog-mode-2453"></a><a name="index-Python-mode-2454"></a><a name="index-Ruby-mode-2455"></a><a name="index-Simula-mode-2456"></a><a name="index-VHDL-mode-2457"></a><a name="index-M4-mode-2458"></a><a name="index-Shell_002dscript-mode-2459"></a><a name="index-OPascal-mode-2460"></a><a name="index-PostScript-mode-2461"></a><a name="index-Conf-mode-2462"></a><a name="index-DNS-mode-2463"></a><a name="index-Javascript-mode-2464"></a>  Emacs has programming language modes for Lisp, Scheme, the
Scheme-based DSSSL expression language, Ada, ASM, AWK, C, C++,
Fortran, Icon, IDL (CORBA), IDLWAVE, Java, Javascript, Metafont
(TeX's companion for font creation), Modula2, Object Pascal, Objective-C,
Octave, Pascal, Perl, Pike, PostScript, Prolog, Python, Ruby, Simula, Tcl,
and VHDL.  An alternative mode for Perl is called CPerl mode.  Modes are
also available for the scripting languages of the common GNU and Unix
shells, and MS-DOS/MS-Windows `<samp><span class="samp">BAT</span></samp>' files, and for makefiles,
DNS master files, and various sorts of configuration files.

   <p>Ideally, Emacs should have a major mode for each programming
language that you might want to edit.  If it doesn't have a mode for
your favorite language, the mode might be implemented in a package not
distributed with Emacs (see <a href="#Packages">Packages</a>); or you can contribute one.

   <p><a name="index-DEL-_0040r_007b_0028programming-modes_0029_007d-2465"></a><a name="index-backward_002ddelete_002dchar_002duntabify-2466"></a>  In most programming languages, indentation should vary from line to
line to illustrate the structure of the program.  Therefore, in most
programming language modes, typing &lt;TAB&gt; updates the indentation
of the current line (see <a href="#Program-Indent">Program Indent</a>).  Furthermore, &lt;DEL&gt;
is usually bound to <code>backward-delete-char-untabify</code>, which
deletes backward treating each tab as if it were the equivalent number
of spaces, so that you can delete one column of indentation without
worrying whether the whitespace consists of spaces or tabs.

   <p><a name="index-mode-hook-2467"></a><a name="index-c_002dmode_002dhook-2468"></a><a name="index-lisp_002dmode_002dhook-2469"></a><a name="index-emacs_002dlisp_002dmode_002dhook-2470"></a><a name="index-lisp_002dinteraction_002dmode_002dhook-2471"></a><a name="index-scheme_002dmode_002dhook-2472"></a>  Entering a programming language mode runs the custom Lisp functions
specified in the hook variable <code>prog-mode-hook</code>, followed by
those specified in the mode's own mode hook (see <a href="#Major-Modes">Major Modes</a>). 
For instance, entering C mode runs the hooks <code>prog-mode-hook</code> and
<code>c-mode-hook</code>.  See <a href="#Hooks">Hooks</a>, for information about hooks.

   <p>Separate manuals are available for the modes for Ada (see <a href="ada-mode.html#Top">Ada Mode</a>), C/C++/Objective C/Java/Corba
IDL/Pike/AWK (see <a href="ccmode.html#Top">CC Mode</a>), and IDLWAVE
(see <a href="idlwave.html#Top">IDLWAVE</a>).

<h3 class="section">26.2 Top-Level Definitions, or Defuns</h3>

<p>In Emacs, a major definition at the top level in the buffer, such as
a function, is called a <dfn>defun</dfn>.  The name comes from Lisp, but in
Emacs we use it for all languages.

<ul class="menu">
<li><a accesskey="1" href="#Left-Margin-Paren">Left Margin Paren</a>:    An open-paren or similar opening delimiter
                          starts a defun if it is at the left margin.

<h4 class="subsection">26.2.1 Left Margin Convention</h4>

<p><a name="index-open_002dparenthesis-in-leftmost-column-2473"></a><a name="index-g_t_0028-in-leftmost-column-2474"></a>  Many programming-language modes assume by default that any opening
delimiter found at the left margin is the start of a top-level
definition, or defun.  Therefore, <strong>don't put an opening
delimiter at the left margin unless it should have that significance</strong>. 
For instance, never put an open-parenthesis at the left margin in a
Lisp file unless it is the start of a top-level list.

   <p>The convention speeds up many Emacs operations, which would
otherwise have to scan back to the beginning of the buffer to analyze
the syntax of the code.

   <p>If you don't follow this convention, not only will you have trouble
when you explicitly use the commands for motion by defuns; other
features that use them will also give you trouble.  This includes the
indentation commands (see <a href="#Program-Indent">Program Indent</a>) and Font Lock mode
(see <a href="#Font-Lock">Font Lock</a>).

   <p>The most likely problem case is when you want an opening delimiter
at the start of a line inside a string.  To avoid trouble, put an
escape character (`<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>', in C and Emacs Lisp, `<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>' in some
other Lisp dialects) before the opening delimiter.  This will not
affect the contents of the string, but will prevent that opening
delimiter from starting a defun.  Here's an example:

<pre class="example">       (insert "Foo:
     \(bar)
     ")
</pre>
   <p>To help you catch violations of this convention, Font Lock mode
highlights confusing opening delimiters (those that ought to be
quoted) in bold red.

   <p><a name="index-open_002dparen_002din_002dcolumn_002d0_002dis_002ddefun_002dstart-2475"></a>  If you need to override this convention, you can do so by setting
the variable <code>open-paren-in-column-0-is-defun-start</code>. 
If this user option is set to <code>t</code> (the default), opening
parentheses or braces at column zero always start defuns.  When it is
<code>nil</code>, defuns are found by searching for parens or braces at the
outermost level.

   <p>Usually, you should leave this option at its default value of
<code>t</code>.  If your buffer contains parentheses or braces in column
zero which don't start defuns, and it is somehow impractical to remove
these parentheses or braces, it might be helpful to set the option to
<code>nil</code>.  Be aware that this might make scrolling and display in
large buffers quite sluggish.  Furthermore, the parentheses and braces
must be correctly matched throughout the buffer for it to work
properly.

<h4 class="subsection">26.2.2 Moving by Defuns</h4>

<p><a name="index-defuns-2476"></a>
  These commands move point or set up the region based on top-level
major definitions, also called <dfn>defuns</dfn>.

<dt><kbd>C-M-a</kbd><dd>Move to beginning of current or preceding defun
(<code>beginning-of-defun</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-M-e</kbd><dd>Move to end of current or following defun (<code>end-of-defun</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-M-h</kbd><dd>Put region around whole current or following defun (<code>mark-defun</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-move-to-beginning-or-end-of-function-2477"></a><a name="index-function_002c-move-to-beginning-or-end-2478"></a><a name="index-C_002dM_002da-2479"></a><a name="index-C_002dM_002de-2480"></a><a name="index-C_002dM_002dh-2481"></a><a name="index-beginning_002dof_002ddefun-2482"></a><a name="index-end_002dof_002ddefun-2483"></a><a name="index-mark_002ddefun-2484"></a>  The commands to move to the beginning and end of the current defun
are <kbd>C-M-a</kbd> (<code>beginning-of-defun</code>) and <kbd>C-M-e</kbd>
(<code>end-of-defun</code>).  If you repeat one of these commands, or use a
positive numeric argument, each repetition moves to the next defun in
the direction of motion.

   <p><kbd>C-M-a</kbd> with a negative argument &minus;<var>n</var> moves forward
<var>n</var> times to the next beginning of a defun.  This is not exactly
the same place that <kbd>C-M-e</kbd> with argument <var>n</var> would move to;
the end of this defun is not usually exactly the same place as the
beginning of the following defun.  (Whitespace, comments, and perhaps
declarations can separate them.)  Likewise, <kbd>C-M-e</kbd> with a
negative argument moves back to an end of a defun, which is not quite
the same as <kbd>C-M-a</kbd> with a positive argument.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dM_002dh-_0040r_007b_0028C-mode_0029_007d-2485"></a><a name="index-c_002dmark_002dfunction-2486"></a>  To operate on the current defun, use <kbd>C-M-h</kbd>
(<code>mark-defun</code>), which sets the mark at the end of the current
defun and puts point at its beginning.  See <a href="#Marking-Objects">Marking Objects</a>.  This
is the easiest way to get ready to kill the defun in order to move it
to a different place in the file.  If you use the command while point
is between defuns, it uses the following defun.  If you use the
command while the mark is already active, it sets the mark but does
not move point; furthermore, each successive use of <kbd>C-M-h</kbd>
extends the end of the region to include one more defun.

   <p>In C mode, <kbd>C-M-h</kbd> runs the function <code>c-mark-function</code>,
which is almost the same as <code>mark-defun</code>; the difference is that
it backs up over the argument declarations, function name and returned
data type so that the entire C function is inside the region.  This is
an example of how major modes adjust the standard key bindings so that
they do their standard jobs in a way better fitting a particular
language.  Other major modes may replace any or all of these key
bindings for that purpose.

  The Imenu facility offers a way to find the major definitions in
a file by name.  It is also useful in text formatter major modes,
where it treats each chapter, section, etc., as a definition. 
(See <a href="#Xref">Xref</a>, for a more powerful feature that handles multiple files
together.)

   <p><a name="index-imenu-2489"></a>  If you type <kbd>M-x imenu</kbd>, it reads the name of a definition using
the minibuffer, then moves point to that definition.  You can use
completion to specify the name; the command always displays the whole
list of valid names.

   <p><a name="index-imenu_002dadd_002dmenubar_002dindex-2490"></a>  Alternatively, you can bind the command <code>imenu</code> to a mouse
click.  Then it displays mouse menus for you to select a definition
name.  You can also add the buffer's index to the menu bar by calling
<code>imenu-add-menubar-index</code>.  If you want to have this menu bar
item available for all buffers in a certain major mode, you can do
this by adding <code>imenu-add-menubar-index</code> to its mode hook.  But
if you have done that, you will have to wait a little while each time
you visit a file in that mode, while Emacs finds all the definitions
in that buffer.

   <p><a name="index-imenu_002dauto_002drescan-2491"></a>  When you change the contents of a buffer, if you add or delete
definitions, you can update the buffer's index based on the
new contents by invoking the `<samp><span class="samp">*Rescan*</span></samp>' item in the menu. 
Rescanning happens automatically if you set <code>imenu-auto-rescan</code> to
a non-<code>nil</code> value.  There is no need to rescan because of small
changes in the text.

   <p><a name="index-imenu_002dsort_002dfunction-2492"></a>  You can customize the way the menus are sorted by setting the
variable <code>imenu-sort-function</code>.  By default, names are ordered as
they occur in the buffer; if you want alphabetic sorting, use the
symbol <code>imenu--sort-by-name</code> as the value.  You can also
define your own comparison function by writing Lisp code.

   <p>Imenu provides the information to guide Which Function mode
(see <a href="#Which-Function">Which Function</a>). 
The Speedbar can also use it (see <a href="#Speedbar">Speedbar</a>).

  Which Function mode is a global minor mode (see <a href="#Minor-Modes">Minor Modes</a>)
which displays the current function name in the mode line, updating it
as you move around in a buffer.

   <p><a name="index-which_002dfunction_002dmode-2494"></a><a name="index-which_002dfunc_002dmodes-2495"></a>  To either enable or disable Which Function mode, use the command
<kbd>M-x which-function-mode</kbd>.  Which Function mode is a global minor
mode.  By default, it takes effect in all major modes major modes that
know how to support it (i.e., all the major modes that support
Imenu).  You can restrict it to a specific list of major modes by
changing the value of the variable <code>which-func-modes</code> from
<code>t</code> (which means to support all available major modes) to a list
of major mode names.

<p><a name="index-indentation-for-programs-2496"></a>
  The best way to keep a program properly indented is to use Emacs to

single line, a specified number of lines, or all of the lines inside a
single parenthetical grouping.

   <p>See <a href="#Indentation">Indentation</a>, for general information about indentation.  This
section describes indentation features specific to programming
language modes.

(<code>indent-for-tab-command</code>), which was documented in
<a href="#Indentation">Indentation</a>.  In programming language modes, &lt;TAB&gt; indents
the current line, based on the indentation and syntactic content of
the preceding lines; if the region is active, &lt;TAB&gt; indents each
line within the region, not just the current line.

   <p>The command &lt;RET&gt; (<code>newline</code>), which was documented in
<a href="#Inserting-Text">Inserting Text</a>, does the same as <kbd>C-j</kbd> followed by
&lt;TAB&gt;: it inserts a new line, then adjusts the line's indentation.

   <p>When indenting a line that starts within a parenthetical grouping,
Emacs usually places the start of the line under the preceding line
within the group, or under the text after the parenthesis.  If you
manually give one of these lines a nonstandard indentation (e.g., for
aesthetic purposes), the lines below will follow it.

   <p>The indentation commands for most programming language modes assume
that a open-parenthesis, open-brace or other opening delimiter at the
left margin is the start of a function.  If the code you are editing
violates this assumption&mdash;even if the delimiters occur in strings or
comments&mdash;you must set <code>open-paren-in-column-0-is-defun-start</code>
to <code>nil</code> for indentation to work properly.  See <a href="#Left-Margin-Paren">Left Margin Paren</a>.

<h4 class="subsection">26.3.2 Indenting Several Lines</h4>

<p>Sometimes, you may want to reindent several lines of code at a time. 
One way to do this is to use the mark; when the mark is active and the
region is non-empty, &lt;TAB&gt; indents every line in the region. 
Alternatively, the command <kbd>C-M-\</kbd> (<code>indent-region</code>) indents
every line in the region, whether or not the mark is active
(see <a href="#Indentation-Commands">Indentation Commands</a>).

   <p>In addition, Emacs provides the following commands for indenting
large chunks of code:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-M-q</kbd><dd>Reindent all the lines within one parenthetical grouping. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-u &lt;TAB&gt;</kbd><dd>Shift an entire parenthetical grouping rigidly sideways so that its
first line is properly indented. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x indent-code-rigidly</kbd><dd>Shift all the lines in the region rigidly sideways, but do not alter
lines that start inside comments and strings. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dM_002dq-2502"></a><a name="index-indent_002dpp_002dsexp-2503"></a>  To reindent the contents of a single parenthetical grouping,
position point before the beginning of the grouping and type
<kbd>C-M-q</kbd>.  This changes the relative indentation within the
grouping, without affecting its overall indentation (i.e., the
indentation of the line where the grouping starts).  The function that
<kbd>C-M-q</kbd> runs depends on the major mode; it is
<code>indent-pp-sexp</code> in Lisp mode, <code>c-indent-exp</code> in C mode,
etc.  To correct the overall indentation as well, type &lt;TAB&gt;
first.

   <p><a name="index-C_002du-TAB-2504"></a>  If you like the relative indentation within a grouping but not the
indentation of its first line, move point to that first line and type
<kbd>C-u &lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>.  In Lisp, C, and some other major modes,
&lt;TAB&gt; with a numeric argument reindents the current line as usual,
then reindents by the same amount all the lines in the parenthetical
grouping starting on the current line.  It is clever, though, and does
not alter lines that start inside strings.  Neither does it alter C
preprocessor lines when in C mode, but it does reindent any
continuation lines that may be attached to them.

   <p><a name="index-indent_002dcode_002drigidly-2505"></a>  The command <kbd>M-x indent-code-rigidly</kbd> rigidly shifts all the
lines in the region sideways, like <code>indent-rigidly</code> does
(see <a href="#Indentation-Commands">Indentation Commands</a>).  It doesn't alter the indentation of
lines that start inside a string, unless the region also starts inside
that string.  The prefix arg specifies the number of columns to
indent.

<h4 class="subsection">26.3.3 Customizing Lisp Indentation</h4>

<p><a name="index-customizing-Lisp-indentation-2506"></a>
  The indentation pattern for a Lisp expression can depend on the function
called by the expression.  For each Lisp function, you can choose among
several predefined patterns of indentation, or define an arbitrary one with
a Lisp program.

   <p>The standard pattern of indentation is as follows: the second line of the
expression is indented under the first argument, if that is on the same
line as the beginning of the expression; otherwise, the second line is
indented underneath the function name.  Each following line is indented
under the previous line whose nesting depth is the same.

   <p><a name="index-lisp_002dindent_002doffset-2507"></a>  If the variable <code>lisp-indent-offset</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, it overrides
the usual indentation pattern for the second line of an expression, so that
such lines are always indented <code>lisp-indent-offset</code> more columns than
the containing list.

   <p><a name="index-lisp_002dbody_002dindent-2508"></a>  Certain functions override the standard pattern.  Functions whose
names start with <code>def</code> treat the second lines as the start of
a <dfn>body</dfn>, by indenting the second line <code>lisp-body-indent</code>
additional columns beyond the open-parenthesis that starts the
expression.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007blisp_002dindent_002dfunction_007d-property-2509"></a>  You can override the standard pattern in various ways for individual
functions, according to the <code>lisp-indent-function</code> property of
the function name.  This is normally done for macro definitions, using
the <code>declare</code> construct.  See <a href="elisp.html#Defining-Macros">Defining Macros</a>.

(<code>c-indent-exp</code>).  A prefix argument inhibits warning messages
about invalid syntax.

     <br><dt><code>&lt;TAB&gt;</code><dd><a name="index-c_002dindent_002dcommand-2514"></a>Reindent the current line, and/or in some cases insert a tab character
(<code>c-indent-command</code>).

     <p><a name="index-c_002dtab_002dalways_002dindent-2515"></a>If <code>c-tab-always-indent</code> is <code>t</code>, this command always reindents
the current line and does nothing else.  This is the default.

     <p>If that variable is <code>nil</code>, this command reindents the current line
only if point is at the left margin or in the line's indentation;
otherwise, it inserts a tab (or the equivalent number of spaces,
if <code>indent-tabs-mode</code> is <code>nil</code>).

     <p>Any other value (not <code>nil</code> or <code>t</code>) means always reindent the
line, and also insert a tab if within a comment or a string. 
</dl>

   <p>To reindent the whole current buffer, type <kbd>C-x h C-M-\</kbd>.  This
first selects the whole buffer as the region, then reindents that
region.

   <p>To reindent the current block, use <kbd>C-M-u C-M-q</kbd>.  This moves
to the front of the block and then reindents it all.

<h4 class="subsection">26.3.5 Customizing C Indentation</h4>

<p><a name="index-style-_0028for-indentation_0029-2516"></a>
  C mode and related modes use a flexible mechanism for customizing
indentation.  C mode indents a source line in two steps: first it
classifies the line syntactically according to its contents and
context; second, it determines the indentation offset associated by
your selected <dfn>style</dfn> with the syntactic construct and adds this
onto the indentation of the <dfn>anchor statement</dfn>.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-c . </kbd><var>style</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Select a predefined style <var>style</var> (<code>c-set-style</code>). 
</dl>

   <p>A <dfn>style</dfn> is a named collection of customizations that can be
used in C mode and the related modes.  <a href="ccmode.html#Styles">Styles</a>, for a complete description.  Emacs comes with several
predefined styles, including <code>gnu</code>, <code>k&amp;r</code>, <code>bsd</code>,
<code>stroustrup</code>, <code>linux</code>, <code>python</code>, <code>java</code>,
<code>whitesmith</code>, <code>ellemtel</code>, and <code>awk</code>.  Some of these
styles are primarily intended for one language, but any of them can be
used with any of the languages supported by these modes.  To find out
what a style looks like, select it and reindent some code, e.g., by
typing <kbd>C-M-q</kbd> at the start of a function definition.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dc-_002e-_0040r_007b_0028C-mode_0029_007d-2517"></a><a name="index-c_002dset_002dstyle-2518"></a>  To choose a style for the current buffer, use the command <kbd>C-c&nbsp;.</kbd><!-- /@w -->.  Specify a style name as an argument (case is not significant). 
This command affects the current buffer only, and it affects only
future invocations of the indentation commands; it does not reindent
the code already in the buffer.  To reindent the whole buffer in the
new style, you can type <kbd>C-x h C-M-\</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-c_002ddefault_002dstyle-2519"></a>  You can also set the variable <code>c-default-style</code> to specify the
default style for various major modes.  Its value should be either the
style's name (a string) or an alist, in which each element specifies
one major mode and which indentation style to use for it.  For
example,

<pre class="example">     (setq c-default-style
           '((java-mode . "java")
             (awk-mode . "awk")
             (other . "gnu")))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">specifies explicit choices for Java and AWK modes, and the default
`<samp><span class="samp">gnu</span></samp>' style for the other C-like modes.  (These settings are
actually the defaults.)  This variable takes effect when you select
one of the C-like major modes; thus, if you specify a new default
style for Java mode, you can make it take effect in an existing Java
mode buffer by typing <kbd>M-x java-mode</kbd> there.

   <p>The <code>gnu</code> style specifies the formatting recommended by the GNU
Project for C; it is the default, so as to encourage use of our
recommended style.

   <p>See <a href="ccmode.html#Indentation-Engine-Basics">Indentation Engine Basics</a>, and
<a href="ccmode.html#Customizing-Indentation">Customizing Indentation</a>, for more
information on customizing indentation for C and related modes,
including how to override parts of an existing style and how to define
your own styles.

   <p><a name="index-c_002dguess-2520"></a><a name="index-c_002dguess_002dinstall-2521"></a>  As an alternative to specifying a style, you can tell Emacs to guess
a style by typing <kbd>M-x c-guess</kbd> in a sample code buffer.  You can
then apply the guessed style to other buffers with <kbd>M-x
c-guess-install</kbd>.  See <a href="ccmode.html#Guessing-the-Style">Guessing the Style</a>, for details.

   <p>When talking about these facilities, the term &ldquo;parenthesis&rdquo; also
includes braces, brackets, or whatever delimiters are defined to match
in pairs.  The major mode controls which delimiters are significant,
through the syntax table (see <a href="elisp.html#Syntax-Tables">Syntax Tables</a>).  In Lisp, only parentheses count;
in C, these commands apply to braces and brackets too.

   <p>You can use <kbd>M-x check-parens</kbd> to find any unbalanced

<h4 class="subsection">26.4.1 Expressions with Balanced Parentheses</h4>

<p><a name="index-sexp-2524"></a><a name="index-expression-2525"></a><a name="index-balanced-expression-2526"></a>  Each programming language mode has its own definition of a
<dfn>balanced expression</dfn>.  Balanced expressions typically include
individual symbols, numbers, and string constants, as well as pieces
of code enclosed in a matching pair of delimiters.  The following
commands deal with balanced expressions (in Emacs, such expressions
are referred to internally as <dfn>sexps</dfn><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-11" name="fnd-11"><sup>11</sup></a>).

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-M-f</kbd><dd>Move forward over a balanced expression (<code>forward-sexp</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-M-b</kbd><dd>Move backward over a balanced expression (<code>backward-sexp</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-M-k</kbd><dd>Kill balanced expression forward (<code>kill-sexp</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-M-t</kbd><dd>Transpose expressions (<code>transpose-sexps</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-M-@</kbd><dt><kbd>C-M-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd><dd>Put mark after following expression (<code>mark-sexp</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dM_002df-2527"></a><a name="index-C_002dM_002db-2528"></a><a name="index-forward_002dsexp-2529"></a><a name="index-backward_002dsexp-2530"></a>  To move forward over a balanced expression, use <kbd>C-M-f</kbd>
(<code>forward-sexp</code>).  If the first significant character after point
is an opening delimiter (e.g., `<samp><span class="samp">(</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">[</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">{</span></samp>' in C),
this command moves past the matching closing delimiter.  If the
character begins a symbol, string, or number, the command moves over
that.

   <p>The command <kbd>C-M-b</kbd> (<code>backward-sexp</code>) moves backward over a
balanced expression&mdash;like <kbd>C-M-f</kbd>, but in the reverse direction. 
If the expression is preceded by any prefix characters (single-quote,
backquote and comma, in Lisp), the command moves back over them as
well.

   <p><kbd>C-M-f</kbd> or <kbd>C-M-b</kbd> with an argument repeats that operation
the specified number of times; with a negative argument means to move
in the opposite direction.  In most modes, these two commands move
across comments as if they were whitespace.  Note that their keys,
<kbd>C-M-f</kbd> and <kbd>C-M-b</kbd>, are analogous to <kbd>C-f</kbd> and <kbd>C-b</kbd>,
which move by characters (see <a href="#Moving-Point">Moving Point</a>), and <kbd>M-f</kbd> and
<kbd>M-b</kbd>, which move by words (see <a href="#Words">Words</a>).

   <p><a name="index-killing-expressions-2531"></a><a name="index-C_002dM_002dk-2532"></a><a name="index-kill_002dsexp-2533"></a>  To kill a whole balanced expression, type <kbd>C-M-k</kbd>
(<code>kill-sexp</code>).  This kills the text that <kbd>C-M-f</kbd> would move
over.

   <p><a name="index-transposition-of-expressions-2534"></a><a name="index-C_002dM_002dt-2535"></a><a name="index-transpose_002dsexps-2536"></a>  <kbd>C-M-t</kbd> (<code>transpose-sexps</code>) switches the positions of the
previous balanced expression and the next one.  It is analogous to the
<kbd>C-t</kbd> command, which transposes characters (see <a href="#Transpose">Transpose</a>). 
An argument to <kbd>C-M-t</kbd> serves as a repeat count, moving the
previous expression over that many following ones.  A negative
argument moves the previous balanced expression backwards across those
before it.  An argument of zero, rather than doing nothing, transposes
the balanced expressions ending at or after point and the mark.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dM_002d_0040_0040-2537"></a><a name="index-C_002dM_002d_0040key_007bSPC_007d-2538"></a><a name="index-mark_002dsexp-2539"></a>  To operate on balanced expressions with a command which acts on the
region, type <kbd>C-M-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> (<code>mark-sexp</code>).  This sets the
mark where <kbd>C-M-f</kbd> would move to.  While the mark is active, each
successive call to this command extends the region by shifting the
mark by one expression.  Positive or negative numeric arguments move
the mark forward or backward by the specified number of expressions. 
The alias <kbd>C-M-@</kbd> is equivalent to <kbd>C-M-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>. 
See <a href="#Marking-Objects">Marking Objects</a>, for more information about this and related
commands.

   <p>In languages that use infix operators, such as C, it is not possible
to recognize all balanced expressions because there can be multiple
possibilities at a given position.  For example, C mode does not treat
`<samp><span class="samp">foo + bar</span></samp>' as a single expression, even though it <em>is</em> one
C expression; instead, it recognizes `<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>' as one expression and
`<samp><span class="samp">bar</span></samp>' as another, with the `<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>' as punctuation between them. 
However, C mode recognizes `<samp><span class="samp">(foo + bar)</span></samp>' as a single expression,
because of the parentheses.

  The following commands move over groupings delimited by parentheses
(or whatever else serves as delimiters in the language you are working
with).  They ignore strings and comments, including any parentheses
within them, and also ignore parentheses that are quoted with an
escape character.  These commands are mainly intended for editing
programs, but can be useful for editing any text containing
parentheses.  They are referred to internally as &ldquo;list commands&rdquo;
because in Lisp these groupings are lists.

   <p>These commands assume that the starting point is not inside a string
or a comment.  If you invoke them from inside a string or comment, the
results are unreliable.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-M-n</kbd><dd>Move forward over a parenthetical group (<code>forward-list</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-M-p</kbd><dd>Move backward over a parenthetical group (<code>backward-list</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-M-u</kbd><dd>Move up in parenthesis structure (<code>backward-up-list</code>).

<kbd>C-M-p</kbd> (<code>backward-list</code>) move forward or backward over one
(or <var>n</var>) parenthetical groupings.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dM_002du-2549"></a><a name="index-backward_002dup_002dlist-2550"></a>  <kbd>C-M-n</kbd> and <kbd>C-M-p</kbd> try to stay at the same level in the
parenthesis structure.  To move <em>up</em> one (or <var>n</var>) levels, use
<kbd>C-M-u</kbd> (<code>backward-up-list</code>).  <kbd>C-M-u</kbd> moves backward up
past one unmatched opening delimiter.  A positive argument serves as a
repeat count; a negative argument reverses the direction of motion, so
that the command moves forward and up one or more levels.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dM_002dd-2551"></a><a name="index-down_002dlist-2552"></a>  To move <em>down</em> in the parenthesis structure, use <kbd>C-M-d</kbd>
(<code>down-list</code>).  In Lisp mode, where `<samp><span class="samp">(</span></samp>' is the only opening
delimiter, this is nearly the same as searching for a `<samp><span class="samp">(</span></samp>'.  An
argument specifies the number of levels to go down.

<p><a name="index-matching-parentheses-2553"></a><a name="index-parentheses_002c-displaying-matches-2554"></a>
  Emacs has a number of <dfn>parenthesis matching</dfn> features, which
make it easy to see how and whether parentheses (or other delimiters)
match up.

   <p>Whenever you type a self-inserting character that is a closing
delimiter, Emacs briefly indicates the location of the matching
opening delimiter, provided that is on the screen.  If it is not on
the screen, Emacs displays some of the text near it in the echo area. 
Either way, you can tell which grouping you are closing off.  If the
opening delimiter and closing delimiter are mismatched&mdash;such as in
`<samp><span class="samp">[x)</span></samp>'&mdash;a warning message is displayed in the echo area.

   <p><a name="index-blink_002dmatching_002dparen-2555"></a><a name="index-blink_002dmatching_002dparen_002ddistance-2556"></a><a name="index-blink_002dmatching_002ddelay-2557"></a>  Three variables control the display of matching parentheses:

     <ul>
<li><code>blink-matching-paren</code> turns the feature on or off: <code>nil</code>
disables it, but the default is <code>t</code> to enable it.  Set it to
<code>jump</code> to make indication work by momentarily moving the cursor
to the matching opening delimiter.  Set it to <code>jump-offscreen</code> to
make the cursor jump, even if the opening delimiter is off screen.

     <li><code>blink-matching-delay</code> says how many seconds to keep indicating
the matching opening delimiter.  This may be an integer or
floating-point number; the default is 1.

     <li><code>blink-matching-paren-distance</code> specifies how many characters
back to search to find the matching opening delimiter.  If the match
is not found in that distance, Emacs stops scanning and nothing is
displayed.  The default is 102400. 
</ul>

   <p><a name="index-Show-Paren-mode-2558"></a><a name="index-highlighting-matching-parentheses-2559"></a><a name="index-show_002dparen_002dmode-2560"></a>  Show Paren mode, a global minor mode, provides a more powerful kind
of automatic matching.  Whenever point is before an opening delimiter
or after a closing delimiter, the delimiter, its matching delimiter,
and optionally the text between them are highlighted.  To toggle Show
Paren mode, type <kbd>M-x show-paren-mode</kbd>.  To customize it, type
<kbd>M-x customize-group &lt;RET&gt; paren-showing</kbd>.  The customizable
options which control the operation of this mode include:

     <ul>
<li><code>show-paren-highlight-open-paren</code> controls whether to highlight
an open paren when point stands just before it, and hence its position
is marked by the cursor anyway.  The default is non-<code>nil</code> (yes).

     <li><code>show-paren-style</code> controls whether just the two parens, or also
the space between them get highlighted.  The valid options here are
<code>parenthesis</code> (show the matching paren), <code>expression</code>
(highlight the entire expression enclosed by the parens), and
<code>mixed</code> (highlight the matching paren if it is visible, the
expression otherwise).

     <li><code>show-paren-when-point-inside-paren</code>, when non-<code>nil</code>, causes
highlighting also when point is on the inside of a parenthesis.

     <li><code>show-paren-when-point-in-periphery</code>, when non-<code>nil</code>, causes
highlighting also when point is in whitespace at the beginning or end
of a line, and there is a paren at, respectively, the first or last,
or the last, non-whitespace position on the line. 
</ul>

   <p><a name="index-Electric-Pair-mode-2561"></a><a name="index-inserting-matching-parentheses-2562"></a><a name="index-electric_002dpair_002dmode-2563"></a>  Electric Pair mode, a global minor mode, provides a way to easily
insert matching delimiters.  Whenever you insert an opening delimiter,
the matching closing delimiter is automatically inserted as well,
leaving point between the two.  Conversely, when you insert a closing
delimiter over an existing one, no inserting takes places and that
position is simply skipped over.  These variables control additional
features of Electric Pair mode:

     <ul>
<li><code>electric-pair-preserve-balance</code>, when non-<code>nil</code>, makes the
default pairing logic balance out the number of opening and closing
delimiters.

     <li><code>electric-pair-delete-adjacent-pairs</code>, when non-<code>nil</code>, makes
backspacing between two adjacent delimiters also automatically delete
the closing delimiter.

     <li><code>electric-pair-open-newline-between-pairs</code>, when non-<code>nil</code>,
makes inserting inserting a newline between two adjacent pairs also
automatically open and extra newline after point.

     <li><code>electric-pair-skip-whitespace</code>, when non-<code>nil</code>, causes the minor
mode to skip whitespace forward before deciding whether to skip over
the closing delimiter. 
</ul>

   <p>To toggle Electric Pair mode, type <kbd>M-x electric-pair-mode</kbd>.  To
toggle the mode in a single buffer, use <kbd>M-x
electric-pair-local-mode</kbd>.

<h3 class="section">26.5 Manipulating Comments</h3>

<p><a name="index-comments-2564"></a>
  Because comments are such an important part of programming, Emacs
provides special commands for editing and inserting comments.  It can
also do spell checking on comments with Flyspell Prog mode
(see <a href="#Spelling">Spelling</a>).

   <p>Some major modes have special rules for indenting different kinds of
comments.  For example, in Lisp code, comments starting with two
semicolons are indented as if they were lines of code, while those
starting with three semicolons are supposed to be aligned to the left
margin and are often used for sectioning purposes.  Emacs understand
these conventions; for instance, typing &lt;TAB&gt; on a comment line
will indent the comment to the appropriate position.

<pre class="example">     ;; This function is just an example.
     ;;; Here either two or three semicolons are appropriate.
     (defun foo (x)
     ;;;  And now, the first part of the function:
       ;; The following line adds one.
       (1+ x))           ; This line adds one.

<h4 class="subsection">26.5.1 Comment Commands</h4>

<p><a name="index-indentation-for-comments-2565"></a><a name="index-alignment-for-comments-2566"></a>
  The following commands operate on comments:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-;</kbd><dd>Insert or realign comment on current line; if the region is active,
comment or uncomment the region instead (<code>comment-dwim</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x C-;</kbd><dd>Comment or uncomment the current line (<code>comment-line</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-u M-;</kbd><dd>Kill comment on current line (<code>comment-kill</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x ;</kbd><dd>Set comment column (<code>comment-set-column</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-M-j</kbd><dt><kbd>M-j</kbd><dd>Like &lt;RET&gt; followed by inserting and aligning a comment
(<code>comment-indent-new-line</code>).  See <a href="#Multi_002dLine-Comments">Multi-Line Comments</a>. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x comment-region</kbd><dt><kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> (in C-like modes)<dd>Add comment delimiters to all the lines in the region. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-M_002d_003b-2567"></a><a name="index-comment_002ddwim-2568"></a>  The command to create or align a comment is <kbd>M-;</kbd>
(<code>comment-dwim</code>).  The word &ldquo;dwim&rdquo; is an acronym for &ldquo;Do What
I Mean&rdquo;; it indicates that this command can be used for many
different jobs relating to comments, depending on the situation where
you use it.

   <p>When a region is active (see <a href="#Mark">Mark</a>), <kbd>M-;</kbd> either adds
comment delimiters to the region, or removes them.  If every line in
the region is already a comment, it uncomments each of those lines
by removing their comment delimiters.  Otherwise, it adds comment
delimiters to enclose the text in the region.

   <p>If you supply a prefix argument to <kbd>M-;</kbd> when a region is
active, that specifies the number of comment delimiters to add or
delete.  A positive argument <var>n</var> adds <var>n</var> delimiters, while a
negative argument <var>-n</var> removes <var>n</var> delimiters.

   <p>If the region is not active, and there is no existing comment on the
current line, <kbd>M-;</kbd> adds a new comment to the current line.  If
the line is blank (i.e., empty or containing only whitespace
characters), the comment is indented to the same position where
&lt;TAB&gt; would indent to (see <a href="#Basic-Indent">Basic Indent</a>).  If the line is
non-blank, the comment is placed after the last non-whitespace
character on the line; normally, Emacs tries putting it at the column
specified by the variable <code>comment-column</code> (see <a href="#Options-for-Comments">Options for Comments</a>), but if the line already extends past that column, it puts
the comment at some suitable position, usually separated from the
non-comment text by at least one space.  In each case, Emacs places
point after the comment's starting delimiter, so that you can start
typing the comment text right away.

   <p>You can also use <kbd>M-;</kbd> to align an existing comment.  If a line
already contains the comment-start string, <kbd>M-;</kbd> realigns it to
the conventional alignment and moves point after the comment's
starting delimiter.  As an exception, comments starting in column 0
are not moved.  Even when an existing comment is properly aligned,
<kbd>M-;</kbd> is still useful for moving directly to the start of the
comment text.

   <p><a name="index-comment_002dline-2569"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002d_003b-2570"></a>  <kbd>C-x C-;</kbd> (<code>comment-line</code>) comments or uncomments complete
lines.  When a region is active (see <a href="#Mark">Mark</a>), <kbd>C-x C-;</kbd> either
comments or uncomments the lines in the region.  If the region is not
active, this command comments or uncomments the line point is on. 
With a positive prefix argument <var>n</var>, it operates on <var>n</var> lines
starting with the current one; with a negative <var>n</var>, it affects
<var>n</var> preceding lines.  After invoking this command with a negative
argument, successive invocations with a positive argument will operate
on preceding lines as if the argument were negated.

   <p><a name="index-comment_002dkill-2571"></a><a name="index-C_002du-M_002d_003b-2572"></a>  <kbd>C-u M-;</kbd> (<code>comment-dwim</code> with a prefix argument) kills any
comment on the current line, along with the whitespace before it. 
Since the comment is saved to the kill ring, you can reinsert it on
another line by moving to the end of that line, doing <kbd>C-y</kbd>, and
then <kbd>M-;</kbd> to realign the comment.  You can achieve the same
effect as <kbd>C-u M-;</kbd> by typing <kbd>M-x comment-kill</kbd>
(<code>comment-dwim</code> actually calls <code>comment-kill</code> as a
subroutine when it is given a prefix argument).

   <p><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dc-_0028C-mode_0029-2573"></a><a name="index-comment_002dregion-2574"></a><a name="index-uncomment_002dregion-2575"></a>  The command <kbd>M-x comment-region</kbd> is equivalent to calling
<kbd>M-;</kbd> on an active region, except that it always acts on the
region, even if the mark is inactive.  In C mode and related modes,
this command is bound to <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>.  The command <kbd>M-x
uncomment-region</kbd> uncomments each line in the region; a numeric prefix
argument specifies the number of comment delimiters to remove
(negative arguments specify the number of comment to delimiters to
add).

   <p>For C-like modes, you can configure the exact effect of <kbd>M-;</kbd> by
setting the variables <code>c-indent-comment-alist</code> and
<code>c-indent-comments-syntactically-p</code>.  For example, on a line
ending in a closing brace, <kbd>M-;</kbd> puts the comment one space after
the brace rather than at <code>comment-column</code>.  For full details see
<a href="ccmode.html#Comment-Commands">Comment Commands</a>.

<h4 class="subsection">26.5.2 Multiple Lines of Comments</h4>

<p><a name="index-C_002dM_002dj-2576"></a><a name="index-M_002dj-2577"></a><a name="index-blank-lines-in-programs-2578"></a><a name="index-comment_002dindent_002dnew_002dline-2579"></a><a name="index-comment_002dmulti_002dline-2580"></a>  If you are typing a comment and wish to continue it to another line,
type <kbd>M-j</kbd> or <kbd>C-M-j</kbd> (<code>comment-indent-new-line</code>).  This
breaks the current line, and inserts the necessary comment delimiters
and indentation to continue the comment.

   <p>For languages with closing comment delimiters (e.g., `<samp><span class="samp">*/</span></samp>' in
C), the exact behavior of <kbd>M-j</kbd> depends on the value of the
variable <code>comment-multi-line</code>.  If the value is <code>nil</code>, the
command closes the comment on the old line and starts a new comment on
the new line.  Otherwise, it opens a new line within the current
comment delimiters.

   <p>When Auto Fill mode is on, going past the fill column while typing a
comment also continues the comment, in the same way as an explicit
invocation of <kbd>M-j</kbd>.

   <p>To turn existing lines into comment lines, use <kbd>M-;</kbd> with the
region active, or use <kbd>M-x comment-region</kbd>
as described in the preceding section.

   <p>You can configure C Mode such that when you type a `<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>' at the
start of a line in a multi-line block comment, this closes the
comment.  Enable the <code>comment-close-slash</code> clean-up for this.

adds a comment to a line, it tries to place the comment at the column
specified by the buffer-local variable <code>comment-column</code>.  You can
set either the local value or the default value of this buffer-local
variable in the usual way (see <a href="#Locals">Locals</a>).  Alternatively, you can
type <kbd>C-x ;</kbd> (<code>comment-set-column</code>) to set the value of
<code>comment-column</code> in the current buffer to the column where point
is currently located.  <kbd>C-u C-x ;</kbd> sets the comment column to
match the last comment before point in the buffer, and then does a
<kbd>M-;</kbd> to align the current line's comment under the previous one.

   <p><a name="index-comment_002dstart_002dskip-2584"></a>  The comment commands recognize comments based on the regular
expression that is the value of the variable <code>comment-start-skip</code>. 
Make sure this regexp does not match the null string.  It may match more
than the comment starting delimiter in the strictest sense of the word;
for example, in C mode the value of the variable is
<!-- This stops M-q from breaking the line inside that @code. -->
<code>"\\(//+\\|/\\*+\\)\\s&nbsp;*"<!-- /@w --></code>, which matches extra stars and
spaces after the `<samp><span class="samp">/*</span></samp>' itself, and accepts C++ style comments
also.  (Note that `<samp><span class="samp">\\</span></samp>' is needed in Lisp syntax to include a
`<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>' in the string, which is needed to deny the first star its
special meaning in regexp syntax.  See <a href="#Regexp-Backslash">Regexp Backslash</a>.)

   <p><a name="index-comment_002dstart-2585"></a><a name="index-comment_002dend-2586"></a>  When a comment command makes a new comment, it inserts the value of
<code>comment-start</code> as an opening comment delimiter.  It also inserts
the value of <code>comment-end</code> after point, as a closing comment
delimiter.  For example, in Lisp mode, <code>comment-start</code> is
`<samp><span class="samp">";"</span></samp>' and <code>comment-end</code> is <code>""</code> (the empty string).  In
C mode, <code>comment-start</code> is <code>"/* "</code> and <code>comment-end</code> is
<code>" */"</code>.

   <p><a name="index-comment_002dpadding-2587"></a>  The variable <code>comment-padding</code> specifies a string that the
commenting commands should insert between the comment delimiter(s) and
the comment text.  The default, `<samp><span class="samp">" "</span></samp>', specifies a single space. 
Alternatively, the value can be a number, which specifies that number
of spaces, or <code>nil</code>, which means no spaces at all.

   <p>The variable <code>comment-multi-line</code> controls how <kbd>M-j</kbd> and
Auto Fill mode continue comments over multiple lines. 
See <a href="#Multi_002dLine-Comments">Multi-Line Comments</a>.

   <p><a name="index-comment_002dindent_002dfunction-2588"></a>  The variable <code>comment-indent-function</code> should contain a function
that will be called to compute the alignment for a newly inserted
comment or for aligning an existing comment.  It is set differently by
various major modes.  The function is called with no arguments, but with
point at the beginning of the comment, or at the end of a line if a new
comment is to be inserted.  It should return the column in which the
comment ought to start.  For example, in Lisp mode, the indent hook
function bases its decision on how many semicolons begin an existing
comment, and on the code in the preceding lines.

the C Library Manual.  The command only works if the appropriate
manual's Info files are installed.

   <p>The major mode determines where to look for documentation for the

   <p>If you use <kbd>C-h S</kbd> in a major mode that does not support it,

page</dfn> or <dfn>man page</dfn>.  In the GNU operating system, we aim to
replace man pages with better-organized manuals that you can browse
with Info (see <a href="#Misc-Help">Misc Help</a>).  This process is not finished, so it is
still useful to read manual pages.

   <p><a name="index-manual_002dentry-2593"></a>  You can read the man page for an operating system command, library
function, or system call, with the <kbd>M-x man</kbd> command.  This
prompts for a topic, with completion (see <a href="#Completion">Completion</a>), and runs
the <samp><span class="command">man</span></samp> program to format the corresponding man page.  If
the system permits, it runs <samp><span class="command">man</span></samp> asynchronously, so that you
can keep on editing while the page is being formatted.  The result
goes in a buffer named <samp><span class="file">*Man </span><var>topic</var><span class="file">*</span></samp>.  These buffers use a
special major mode, Man mode, that facilitates scrolling and jumping
to other manual pages.  For details, type <kbd>C-h m</kbd> while in a Man
mode buffer.

   <p><a name="index-sections-of-manual-pages-2594"></a>  Each man page belongs to one of ten or more <dfn>sections</dfn>, each
named by a digit or by a digit and a letter.  Sometimes there are man
pages with the same name in different sections.  To read a man page
from a specific section, type `<samp><var>topic</var><span class="samp">(</span><var>section</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>' or
`<samp><var>section</var> <var>topic</var></samp>' when <kbd>M-x manual-entry</kbd> prompts
for the topic.  For example, the man page for the C library function
<code>chmod</code> is in section 2, but there is a shell command of the same
name, whose man page is in section 1; to view the former, type
<kbd>M-x manual-entry &lt;RET&gt; chmod(2) &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-Man_002dswitches-2595"></a><a name="index-M_002dn-_0040r_007b_0028Man-mode_0029_007d-2596"></a><a name="index-M_002dp-_0040r_007b_0028Man-mode_0029_007d-2597"></a>  If you do not specify a section, <kbd>M-x man</kbd> normally displays
only the first man page found.  On some systems, the <code>man</code>
program accepts a `<samp><span class="samp">-a</span></samp>' command-line option, which tells it to
display all the man pages for the specified topic.  To make use of
this, change the value of the variable <code>Man-switches</code> to
`<samp><span class="samp">"-a"</span></samp>'.  Then, in the Man mode buffer, you can type <kbd>M-n</kbd> and
<kbd>M-p</kbd> to switch between man pages in different sections.  The mode
line shows how many manual pages are available.

   <p><a name="index-woman-2598"></a><a name="index-manual-pages_002c-on-MS_002dDOS_002fMS_002dWindows-2599"></a>  An alternative way of reading manual pages is the <kbd>M-x woman</kbd>
command.  Unlike <kbd>M-x man</kbd>, it does not run any external programs
to format and display the man pages; the formatting is done by Emacs,
so it works on systems such as MS-Windows where the <samp><span class="command">man</span></samp>
program may be unavailable.  It prompts for a man page, and displays
it in a buffer named <samp><span class="file">*WoMan </span><var>section</var> <var>topic</var></samp>.

   <p><kbd>M-x woman</kbd> computes the completion list for manpages the first
time you invoke the command.  With a numeric argument, it recomputes
this list; this is useful if you add or delete manual pages.

   <p>If you type a name of a manual page and <kbd>M-x woman</kbd> finds that
several manual pages by the same name exist in different sections, it
pops up a window with possible candidates asking you to choose one of
them.

   <p>For more information about setting up and using <kbd>M-x woman</kbd>, see
the WoMan Info manual, which is distributed with Emacs.

<h4 class="subsection">26.6.3 Emacs Lisp Documentation Lookup</h4>

<p>When editing Emacs Lisp code, you can use the commands <kbd>C-h f</kbd>

documentation.  When it is enabled, the echo area displays some useful
information whenever there is a Lisp function or variable at point;
for a function, it shows the argument list, and for a variable it
shows the first line of the variable's documentation string.  To
toggle Eldoc mode, type <kbd>M-x eldoc-mode</kbd>.  There's also a Global
Eldoc mode, which is turned on by default, and affects buffers, such
as `<samp><span class="samp">*scratch*</span></samp>', whose major mode is Emacs Lisp or Lisp
Interaction (<kbd>M-x&nbsp;global-eldoc-mode</kbd><!-- /@w --> to turn it off globally).

<h3 class="section">26.7 Hideshow minor mode</h3>

<p><a name="index-Hideshow-mode-2603"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Hideshow-2604"></a>
<a name="index-hs_002dminor_002dmode-2605"></a>  Hideshow mode is a buffer-local minor mode that allows you to
selectively display portions of a program, which are referred to as
<dfn>blocks</dfn>.  Type <kbd>M-x hs-minor-mode</kbd> to toggle this minor mode
(see <a href="#Minor-Modes">Minor Modes</a>).

   <p>When you use Hideshow mode to hide a block, the block disappears
from the screen, to be replaced by an ellipsis (three periods in a
row).  Just what constitutes a block depends on the major mode.  In C
mode and related modes, blocks are delimited by braces, while in Lisp
mode they are delimited by parentheses.  Multi-line comments also
count as blocks.

   <p>Hideshow mode provides the following commands:

   <p><a name="index-hs_002dhide_002dall-2606"></a><a name="index-hs_002dhide_002dblock-2607"></a><a name="index-hs_002dshow_002dall-2608"></a><a name="index-hs_002dshow_002dblock-2609"></a><a name="index-hs_002dshow_002dregion-2610"></a><a name="index-hs_002dhide_002dlevel-2611"></a><a name="index-hs_002dminor_002dmode-2612"></a><a name="index-C_002dc-_0040_0040-C_002dh-2613"></a><a name="index-C_002dc-_0040_0040-C_002ds-2614"></a><a name="index-C_002dc-_0040_0040-C_002dM_002dh-2615"></a><a name="index-C_002dc-_0040_0040-C_002dM_002ds-2616"></a><a name="index-C_002dc-_0040_0040-C_002dr-2617"></a><a name="index-C_002dc-_0040_0040-C_002dl-2618"></a><a name="index-S_002dmouse_002d2-2619"></a>

<h3 class="section">26.8 Completion for Symbol Names</h3>

<p><a name="index-completion-_0028symbol-names_0029-2623"></a>
  Completion is normally done in the minibuffer (see <a href="#Completion">Completion</a>),
but you can also complete symbol names in ordinary Emacs buffers.

   <p><a name="index-M_002dTAB-2624"></a><a name="index-C_002dM_002di-2625"></a>  In programming language modes, type <kbd>C-M-i</kbd> or <kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>
to complete the partial symbol before point.  On graphical displays,
the <kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> key is usually reserved by the window manager
for switching graphical windows, so you should type <kbd>C-M-i</kbd> or
<kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; &lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> instead.

   <p><a name="index-tags_002dbased-completion-2626"></a><a name="index-completion_002dat_002dpoint-2627"></a><a name="index-Lisp-symbol-completion-2628"></a><a name="index-completion-_0028Lisp-symbols_0029-2629"></a>  In most programming language modes, <kbd>C-M-i</kbd> (or
<kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>) invokes the command <code>completion-at-point</code>,
which generates its completion list in a flexible way.  If Semantic
mode is enabled, it tries to use the Semantic parser data for
completion (see <a href="#Semantic">Semantic</a>).  If Semantic mode is not enabled or
fails at performing completion, it tries to complete using the
selected tags table (see <a href="#Tags-Tables">Tags Tables</a>).  If in Emacs Lisp mode, it
performs completion using the function, variable, or property names
defined in the current Emacs session.

   <p>In all other respects, in-buffer symbol completion behaves like
minibuffer completion.  For instance, if Emacs cannot complete to a
unique symbol, it displays a list of completion alternatives in
another window.  See <a href="#Completion">Completion</a>.

   <p>In Text mode and related modes, <kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> completes words
based on the spell-checker's dictionary.  See <a href="#Spelling">Spelling</a>.

<h3 class="section">26.9 MixedCase Words</h3>

<p><a name="index-camel-case-2630"></a>
  Some programming styles make use of mixed-case (or &ldquo;CamelCase&rdquo;)
symbols like `<samp><span class="samp">unReadableSymbol</span></samp>'.  (In the GNU project, we recommend
using underscores to separate words within an identifier, rather than
using case distinctions.)  Emacs has various features to make it easier
to deal with such symbols.

   <p><a name="index-Glasses-mode-2631"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Glasses-2632"></a>  Glasses mode is a buffer-local minor mode that makes it easier to read
such symbols, by altering how they are displayed.  By default, it
displays extra underscores between each lower-case letter and the
following capital letter.  This does not alter the buffer text, only how
it is displayed.

   <p>To toggle Glasses mode, type <kbd>M-x glasses-mode</kbd> (see <a href="#Minor-Modes">Minor Modes</a>).  When Glasses mode is enabled, the minor mode indicator
`<samp><span class="samp">o^o</span></samp>' appears in the mode line.  For more information about
Glasses mode, type <kbd>C-h P glasses &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-Subword-mode-2633"></a><a name="index-subword_002dmode-2634"></a>  Subword mode is another buffer-local minor mode.  In subword mode,
Emacs's word commands recognize upper case letters in
`<samp><span class="samp">StudlyCapsIdentifiers</span></samp>' as word boundaries.  When Subword mode is
enabled, the minor mode indicator `<samp><span class="samp">,</span></samp>' appears in the mode line.

<h3 class="section">26.10 Semantic</h3>

<p><a name="index-Semantic-package-2635"></a>
Semantic is a package that provides language-aware editing commands
based on <code>source code parsers</code>.  This section provides a brief
description of Semantic; for full details,
see <a href="semantic.html#Top">Semantic</a>.

   <p>Most of the language-aware features in Emacs, such as Font Lock
mode (see <a href="#Font-Lock">Font Lock</a>), rely on rules of thumb<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-12" name="fnd-12"><sup>12</sup></a> that usually give good results but are
never completely exact.  In contrast, the parsers used by Semantic
have an exact understanding of programming language syntax.  This
allows Semantic to provide search, navigation, and completion commands
that are powerful and precise.

   <p><a name="index-Semantic-mode-2636"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Semantic-2637"></a>  To begin using Semantic, type <kbd>M-x semantic-mode</kbd> or click on
the menu item named `<samp><span class="samp">Source Code Parsers (Semantic)</span></samp>' in the
`<samp><span class="samp">Tools</span></samp>' menu.  This enables Semantic mode, a global minor mode.

   <p>When Semantic mode is enabled, Emacs automatically attempts to
parse each file you visit.  Currently, Semantic understands C, C++,
Scheme, Javascript, Java, HTML, and Make.  Within each parsed buffer,
the following commands are available:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-c , j</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dc-_002c-j-2638"></a>Prompt for the name of a function defined in the current file, and
move point there (<code>semantic-complete-jump-local</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c , J</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dc-_002c-J-2639"></a>Prompt for the name of a function defined in any file Emacs has
parsed, and move point there (<code>semantic-complete-jump</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c , &lt;SPC&gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dc-_002c-_0040key_007bSPC_007d-2640"></a>Display a list of possible completions for the symbol at point
(<code>semantic-complete-analyze-inline</code>).  This also activates a set
of special key bindings for choosing a completion: &lt;RET&gt; accepts
the current completion, <kbd>M-n</kbd> and <kbd>M-p</kbd> cycle through possible
completions, &lt;TAB&gt; completes as far as possible and then cycles,
and <kbd>C-g</kbd> or any other key aborts completion.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c , l</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dc-_002c-l-2641"></a>Display a list of the possible completions of the symbol at point, in
another window (<code>semantic-analyze-possible-completions</code>). 
</dl>

<p class="noindent">In addition to the above commands, the Semantic package provides a
variety of other ways to make use of parser information.  For
instance, you can use it to display a list of completions when Emacs
is idle. 
See <a href="semantic.html#Top">Semantic</a>, for details.

<h3 class="section">26.11 Other Features Useful for Editing Programs</h3>

<p>Some Emacs commands that aren't designed specifically for editing
programs are useful for that nonetheless.

   <p>The Emacs commands that operate on words, sentences and paragraphs
are useful for editing code.  Most symbols names contain words
(see <a href="#Words">Words</a>), while sentences can be found in strings and comments
(see <a href="#Sentences">Sentences</a>).  As for paragraphs, they are defined in most
programming language modes to begin and end at blank lines
(see <a href="#Paragraphs">Paragraphs</a>).  Therefore, judicious use of blank lines to make
the program clearer will also provide useful chunks of text for the
paragraph commands to work on.  Auto Fill mode, if enabled in a
programming language major mode, indents the new lines which it
creates.

   <p><a name="index-superword_002dmode-2642"></a> Superword mode is a buffer-local minor mode that causes editing and
motion commands to treat symbols (e.g., `<samp><span class="samp">this_is_a_symbol</span></samp>') as words. 
When Superword mode is enabled, the minor mode indicator
`<samp><span class="samp">²</span></samp>'
appears in the mode line.  See also the similar <code>subword-mode</code>
(see <a href="#MixedCase-Words">MixedCase Words</a>).

   <p><a name="index-electric_002dlayout_002dmode-2643"></a>  Electric Layout mode (<kbd>M-x electric-layout-mode</kbd>) is a global
minor mode that automatically inserts newlines when you type certain
characters; for example, `<samp><span class="samp">{</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">}</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>' in Javascript
mode.

   <p>Apart from Hideshow mode (see <a href="#Hideshow">Hideshow</a>), another way to
selectively display parts of a program is to use the selective display
feature (see <a href="#Selective-Display">Selective Display</a>).  Programming modes often also
support Outline minor mode (see <a href="#Outline-Mode">Outline Mode</a>), which can be used
with the Foldout package (see <a href="#Foldout">Foldout</a>).

   <p><a name="index-prettify_002dsymbols_002dmode-2644"></a>  Prettify Symbols mode is a buffer-local minor mode that replaces
certain strings with more attractive versions for display purposes. 
For example, in Emacs Lisp mode, it replaces the string `<samp><span class="samp">lambda</span></samp>'
with the Greek lambda character `<samp><span class="samp">λ</span></samp>'.  In a TeX buffer, it will
replace `<samp><span class="samp">\alpha</span></samp>' <small class="dots">...</small> `<samp><span class="samp">\omega</span></samp>' and other math macros with
their Unicode characters.  You may wish to use this in non-programming
modes as well.  You can customize the mode by adding more entries to
<code>prettify-symbols-alist</code>.  More elaborate customization is
available via customizing <code>prettify-symbols-compose-predicate</code> if
its default value <code>prettify-symbols-default-compose-p</code> is not
appropriate.  There is also a global version,
<code>global-prettify-symbols-mode</code>, which enables the mode in all
buffers that support it.

   <p>The symbol at point can be shown in its original form.  This is
controlled by the variable <code>prettify-symbols-unprettify-at-point</code>:
if non-<code>nil</code>, the original form of symbol at point will be
restored for as long as point is at it.

top-level definition.  In languages with enclosing scopes (such as
C++'s classes) the <dfn>current function</dfn> is the immediate one,
possibly inside a scope.  Otherwise it is the one defined by the least
enclosing braces.  (By contrast, <code>beginning-of-defun</code> and
<code>end-of-defun</code> search for braces in column zero.)  See <a href="#Moving-by-Defuns">Moving by Defuns</a>.

<h4 class="subsection">26.12.2 Electric C Characters</h4>

<p>In C mode and related modes, certain printing characters are
<dfn>electric</dfn>&mdash;in addition to inserting themselves, they also
reindent the current line, and optionally also insert newlines.  The
electric characters are <kbd>{</kbd>, <kbd>}</kbd>, <kbd>:</kbd>, <kbd>#</kbd>,
<kbd>;</kbd>, <kbd>,</kbd>, <kbd>&lt;</kbd>, <kbd>&gt;</kbd>, <kbd>/</kbd>, <kbd>*</kbd>, <kbd>(</kbd>, and
<kbd>)</kbd>.

   <p>You might find electric indentation inconvenient if you are editing
chaotically indented code.  If you are new to CC Mode, you might find
it disconcerting.  You can toggle electric action with the command
<kbd>C-c C-l</kbd>; when it is enabled, `<samp><span class="samp">/l</span></samp>' appears in the mode line
after the mode name:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-c C-l</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dl-_0040r_007b_0028C-mode_0029_007d-2672"></a><a name="index-c_002dtoggle_002delectric_002dstate-2673"></a>Toggle electric action (<code>c-toggle-electric-state</code>).  With a
positive prefix argument, this command enables electric action, with a
negative one it disables it. 
</dl>

   <p>Electric characters insert newlines only when, in addition to the
electric state, the <dfn>auto-newline</dfn> feature is enabled (indicated
by `<samp><span class="samp">/la</span></samp>' in the mode line after the mode name).  You can turn
this feature on or off with the command <kbd>C-c C-a</kbd>:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-c C-a</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002da-_0040r_007b_0028C-mode_0029_007d-2674"></a><a name="index-c_002dtoggle_002dauto_002dnewline-2675"></a>Toggle the auto-newline feature (<code>c-toggle-auto-newline</code>).  With a
prefix argument, this command turns the auto-newline feature on if the
argument is positive, and off if it is negative. 
</dl>

   <p>Usually the CC Mode style configures the exact circumstances in
which Emacs inserts auto-newlines.  You can also configure this
directly.  See <a href="ccmode.html#Custom-Auto_002dnewlines">Custom Auto-newlines</a>.

<p><a name="index-hungry-deletion-_0028C-Mode_0029-2676"></a>
  If you want to delete an entire block of whitespace at point, you
can use <dfn>hungry deletion</dfn>.  This deletes all the contiguous
whitespace either before point or after point in a single operation. 
<dfn>Whitespace</dfn> here includes tabs and newlines, but not comments or
preprocessor commands.

   <p>As an alternative to the above commands, you can enable <dfn>hungry
delete mode</dfn>.  When this feature is enabled (indicated by `<samp><span class="samp">/h</span></samp>' in
the mode line after the mode name), a single &lt;DEL&gt; deletes all
preceding whitespace, not just one space, and a single <kbd>C-d</kbd>
(but <em>not</em> plain &lt;Delete&gt;) deletes all following whitespace.

format) source code (normally Fortran 77).  For editing more modern
free-form source code (Fortran 90, 95, 2003, 2008), use F90 mode
(<code>f90-mode</code>).  Emacs normally uses Fortran mode for files with
extension `<samp><span class="samp">.f</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">.F</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">.for</span></samp>', and F90 mode for the
extensions `<samp><span class="samp">.f90</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">.f95</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">.f03</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">.f08</span></samp>'. 
Customize <code>auto-mode-alist</code> to add more extensions.  GNU Fortran
supports both free and fixed form.  This manual mainly documents Fortran
mode, but the corresponding F90 mode features are mentioned when
relevant.

   <p>Fortran mode provides special motion commands for Fortran statements
and subprograms, and indentation commands that understand Fortran
conventions of nesting, line numbers and continuation statements. 
Fortran mode has support for Auto Fill mode that breaks long lines into
proper Fortran continuation lines.  Fortran mode also supports Hideshow
minor mode
(see <a href="#Hideshow">Hideshow</a>),
and Imenu
(see <a href="#Imenu">Imenu</a>).

   <p>Special commands for comments are provided because Fortran comments
are unlike those of other languages.  Built-in abbrevs optionally save
typing when you insert Fortran keywords.

   <p>Use <kbd>M-x fortran-mode</kbd> to switch to this major mode.  This
command runs the hook <code>fortran-mode-hook</code>.

defuns (Fortran subprograms&mdash;functions and subroutines, as well
as modules for F90 mode, using the commands <code>fortran-end-of-subprogram</code>
and <code>fortran-beginning-of-subprogram</code>), Fortran mode provides

to reindent all the lines of the Fortran subprogram (function or

a line in the appropriate fashion for Fortran.  In a non-comment line,
the second half becomes a continuation line and is indented
accordingly.  In a comment line, both halves become separate comment
lines.

<h5 class="subsubsection">26.14.2.2 Continuation Lines</h5>

<p><a name="index-Fortran-continuation-lines-2742"></a>
<a name="index-fortran_002dcontinuation_002dstring-2743"></a>  Most Fortran 77 compilers allow two ways of writing continuation lines. 
If the first non-space character on a line is in column 5, then that
line is a continuation of the previous line.  We call this <dfn>fixed
form</dfn>.  (In GNU Emacs we always count columns from 0; but note that
the Fortran standard counts from 1.)  The variable
<code>fortran-continuation-string</code> specifies what character to put in
column 5.  A line that starts with a tab character followed by any digit
except `<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>' is also a continuation line.  We call this style of
continuation <dfn>tab format</dfn>.  (Fortran 90 introduced free-form
continuation lines.)

   <p><a name="index-indent_002dtabs_002dmode-_0040r_007b_0028Fortran-mode_0029_007d-2744"></a><a name="index-fortran_002danalyze_002ddepth-2745"></a><a name="index-fortran_002dtab_002dmode_002ddefault-2746"></a>  Fortran mode can use either style of continuation line.  When you
enter Fortran mode, it tries to deduce the proper continuation style
automatically from the buffer contents.  It does this by scanning up to
<code>fortran-analyze-depth</code> (default 100) lines from the start of the
buffer.  The first line that begins with either a tab character or six
spaces determines the choice.  If the scan fails (for example, if the
buffer is new and therefore empty), the value of
<code>fortran-tab-mode-default</code> (<code>nil</code> for fixed form, and
non-<code>nil</code> for tab format) is used.  `<samp><span class="samp">/t</span></samp>'
(<code>fortran-tab-mode-string</code>) in the mode line indicates tab format
is selected.  Fortran mode sets the value of <code>indent-tabs-mode</code>
accordingly.

   <p>If the text on a line starts with the Fortran continuation marker
`<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>', or if it begins with any non-whitespace character in column
5, Fortran mode treats it as a continuation line.  When you indent a
continuation line with &lt;TAB&gt;, it converts the line to the current
continuation style.  When you split a Fortran statement with
<kbd>C-M-j</kbd>, the continuation marker on the newline is created according
to the continuation style.

   <p>The setting of continuation style affects several other aspects of
editing in Fortran mode.  In fixed form mode, the minimum column
number for the body of a statement is 6.  Lines inside of Fortran
blocks that are indented to larger column numbers must use only the
space character for whitespace.  In tab format mode, the minimum
column number for the statement body is 8, and the whitespace before
column 8 must consist of one tab character.

</div>

<h5 class="subsubsection">26.14.2.3 Line Numbers</h5>

<p>If a number is the first non-whitespace in the line, Fortran
indentation assumes it is a line number and moves it to columns 0
through 4.  (Columns always count from 0 in Emacs.)

   <p><a name="index-fortran_002dline_002dnumber_002dindent-2747"></a>  Line numbers of four digits or less are normally indented one space. 
The variable <code>fortran-line-number-indent</code> controls this; it
specifies the maximum indentation a line number can have.  The default
value of the variable is 1.  Fortran mode tries to prevent line number
digits passing column 4, reducing the indentation below the specified
maximum if necessary.  If <code>fortran-line-number-indent</code> has the
value 5, line numbers are right-justified to end in column 4.

   <p><a name="index-fortran_002delectric_002dline_002dnumber-2748"></a>  Simply inserting a line number is enough to indent it according to
these rules.  As each digit is inserted, the indentation is recomputed. 
To turn off this feature, set the variable
<code>fortran-electric-line-number</code> to <code>nil</code>.

<h5 class="subsubsection">26.14.2.4 Syntactic Conventions</h5>

<p>Fortran mode assumes that you follow certain conventions that simplify
the task of understanding a Fortran program well enough to indent it
properly:

     <ul>
<li>Two nested `<samp><span class="samp">do</span></samp>' loops never share a `<samp><span class="samp">continue</span></samp>' statement.

     <li>Fortran keywords such as `<samp><span class="samp">if</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">else</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">then</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">do</span></samp>'
and others are written without embedded whitespace or line breaks.

     <p>Fortran compilers generally ignore whitespace outside of string
constants, but Fortran mode does not recognize these keywords if they
are not contiguous.  Constructs such as `<samp><span class="samp">else if</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">end do</span></samp>'
are acceptable, but the second word should be on the same line as the
first and not on a continuation line. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">If you fail to follow these conventions, the indentation commands may
indent some lines unaesthetically.  However, a correct Fortran program
retains its meaning when reindented even if the conventions are not
followed.

     <dl>
<dt><code>fortran-do-indent</code><dd>Extra indentation within each level of `<samp><span class="samp">do</span></samp>' statement (default 3).

     <br><dt><code>fortran-if-indent</code><dd>Extra indentation within each level of `<samp><span class="samp">if</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">select case</span></samp>', or
`<samp><span class="samp">where</span></samp>' statements (default 3).

     <br><dt><code>fortran-structure-indent</code><dd>Extra indentation within each level of `<samp><span class="samp">structure</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">union</span></samp>',
`<samp><span class="samp">map</span></samp>', or `<samp><span class="samp">interface</span></samp>' statements (default 3).

     <br><dt><code>fortran-continuation-indent</code><dd>Extra indentation for bodies of continuation lines (default 5).

     <br><dt><code>fortran-check-all-num-for-matching-do</code><dd>In Fortran 77, a numbered `<samp><span class="samp">do</span></samp>' statement is ended by any statement
with a matching line number.  It is common (but not compulsory) to use a
`<samp><span class="samp">continue</span></samp>' statement for this purpose.  If this variable has a
non-<code>nil</code> value, indenting any numbered statement must check for a
`<samp><span class="samp">do</span></samp>' that ends there.  If you always end `<samp><span class="samp">do</span></samp>' statements with
a `<samp><span class="samp">continue</span></samp>' line (or if you use the more modern `<samp><span class="samp">enddo</span></samp>'),
then you can speed up indentation by setting this variable to
<code>nil</code> (the default).

     <br><dt><code>fortran-blink-matching-if</code><dd>If this is <code>t</code>, indenting an `<samp><span class="samp">endif</span></samp>' (or `<samp><span class="samp">enddo</span></samp>'
statement moves the cursor momentarily to the matching `<samp><span class="samp">if</span></samp>' (or
`<samp><span class="samp">do</span></samp>') statement to show where it is.  The default is <code>nil</code>.

     <br><dt><code>fortran-minimum-statement-indent-fixed</code><dd>Minimum indentation for Fortran statements when using fixed form
continuation line style.  Statement bodies are never indented by less than
this.  The default is 6.

     <br><dt><code>fortran-minimum-statement-indent-tab</code><dd>Minimum indentation for Fortran statements for tab format continuation line
style.  Statement bodies are never indented by less than this.  The
default is 8.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">26.14.3 Fortran Comments</h4>

<p>The usual Emacs comment commands assume that a comment can follow a
line of code.  In Fortran 77, the standard comment syntax requires an
entire line to be just a comment.  Therefore, Fortran mode replaces the
standard Emacs comment commands and defines some new variables.

   <p><a name="index-fortran_002dcomment_002dline_002dstart-2755"></a>  Fortran mode can also handle the Fortran 90 comment syntax where
comments start with `<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>' and can follow other text.  Because only
some Fortran 77 compilers accept this syntax, Fortran mode will not
insert such comments unless you have said in advance to do so.  To do
this, set the variable <code>fortran-comment-line-start</code> to `<samp><span class="samp">"!"</span></samp>'. 
If you use an unusual value, you may need to change
<code>fortran-comment-line-start-skip</code>.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-;</kbd><dd>Align comment or insert new comment (<code>comment-dwim</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-x ;</kbd><dd>Applies to nonstandard `<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>' comments only (<code>comment-set-column</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c ;</kbd><dd>Turn all lines of the region into comments, or (with argument) turn them back
into real code (<code>fortran-comment-region</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><kbd>M-;</kbd> in Fortran mode runs the standard <code>comment-dwim</code>. 
This recognizes any kind of existing comment and aligns its text
appropriately; if there is no existing comment, a comment is inserted
and aligned.  Inserting and aligning comments are not the same in
Fortran mode as in other modes.

   <p>When a new comment must be inserted, if the current line is blank, a
full-line comment is inserted.  On a non-blank line, a nonstandard `<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>'
comment is inserted if you have said you want to use them.  Otherwise a
full-line comment is inserted on a new line before the current line.

   <p>Nonstandard `<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>' comments are aligned like comments in other
languages, but full-line comments are different.  In a standard full-line
comment, the comment delimiter itself must always appear in column zero. 
What can be aligned is the text within the comment.  You can choose from
three styles of alignment by setting the variable
<code>fortran-comment-indent-style</code> to one of these values:

   <p><a name="index-fortran_002dcomment_002dindent_002dstyle-2756"></a><a name="index-fortran_002dcomment_002dline_002dextra_002dindent-2757"></a>
     <dl>
<dt><code>fixed</code><dd>Align the text at a fixed column, which is the sum of
<code>fortran-comment-line-extra-indent</code> and the minimum statement
indentation.  This is the default.

     <p>The minimum indentation is
<code>fortran-minimum-statement-indent-tab</code> for tab format
continuation line style and <code>fortran-minimum-statement-indent-fixed</code>
for fixed form style.

     <br><dt><code>relative</code><dd>Align the text as if it were a line of code, but with an additional
<code>fortran-comment-line-extra-indent</code> columns of indentation.

     <br><dt><code>nil</code><dd>Don't move text in full-line comments automatically. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-fortran_002dcomment_002dindent_002dchar-2758"></a>  In addition, you can specify the character to be used to indent within
full-line comments by setting the variable
<code>fortran-comment-indent-char</code> to the single-character string you want
to use.

   <p><a name="index-fortran_002ddirective_002dre-2759"></a>  Compiler directive lines, or preprocessor lines, have much the same
appearance as comment lines.  It is important, though, that such lines
never be indented at all, no matter what the value of
<code>fortran-comment-indent-style</code>.  The variable
<code>fortran-directive-re</code> is a regular expression that specifies which
lines are directives.  Matching lines are never indented, and receive
distinctive font-locking.

   <p>The normal Emacs comment command <kbd>C-x ;</kbd> (<code>comment-set-column</code>)
has not been redefined.  If you use `<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>' comments, this command
can be used with them.  Otherwise it is useless in Fortran mode.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dc-_003b-_0040r_007b_0028Fortran-mode_0029_007d-2760"></a><a name="index-fortran_002dcomment_002dregion-2761"></a><a name="index-fortran_002dcomment_002dregion-2762"></a>  The command <kbd>C-c ;</kbd> (<code>fortran-comment-region</code>) turns all the
lines of the region into comments by inserting the string `<samp><span class="samp">c$$$</span></samp>' at
the front of each one.  With a numeric argument, it turns the region
back into live code by deleting `<samp><span class="samp">c$$$</span></samp>' from the front of each line
in it.  The string used for these comments can be controlled by setting
the variable <code>fortran-comment-region</code>.  Note that here we have an
example of a command and a variable with the same name; these two uses
of the name never conflict because in Lisp and in Emacs it is always
clear from the context which one is meant.

<h4 class="subsection">26.14.4 Auto Fill in Fortran Mode</h4>

<p>Fortran mode has specialized support for Auto Fill mode, which is a
minor mode that automatically splits statements as you insert them
when they become too wide.  Splitting a statement involves making
continuation lines using <code>fortran-continuation-string</code>
(see <a href="#ForIndent-Cont">ForIndent Cont</a>).  This splitting happens when you type
&lt;SPC&gt;, &lt;RET&gt;, or &lt;TAB&gt;, and also in the Fortran
indentation commands.  You activate Auto Fill in Fortran mode in the
normal way. 
See <a href="#Auto-Fill">Auto Fill</a>.

   <p><a name="index-fortran_002dbreak_002dbefore_002ddelimiters-2763"></a>   Auto Fill breaks lines at spaces or delimiters when the lines get
longer than the desired width (the value of <code>fill-column</code>).  The
delimiters (besides whitespace) that Auto Fill can break at are
`<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">=</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">&lt;</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>',
and `<samp><span class="samp">,</span></samp>'.  The line break comes after the delimiter if the
variable <code>fortran-break-before-delimiters</code> is <code>nil</code>. 
Otherwise (and by default), the break comes before the delimiter.

   <p>To enable Auto Fill in all Fortran buffers, add
<code>auto-fill-mode</code> to <code>fortran-mode-hook</code>. 
See <a href="#Hooks">Hooks</a>.

<h4 class="subsection">26.14.5 Checking Columns in Fortran</h4>

<p><a name="index-fortran_002dline_002dlength-2764"></a>In standard Fortran 77, anything beyond column 72 is ignored. 
Most compilers provide an option to change this (for example,
`<samp><span class="samp">-ffixed-line-length-N</span></samp>' in gfortran).  Customize the variable
<code>fortran-line-length</code> to change the line length in Fortran mode. 
Anything beyond this point is font-locked as a comment.  (Unless it is
inside a string: strings that extend beyond <code>fortran-line-length</code>
will confuse font-lock.)

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-c C-r</kbd><dd>Display a column ruler momentarily above the current line

<br><dt><kbd>C-c C-w</kbd><dd>Split the current window horizontally temporarily so that it is

<br><dt><kbd>C-u C-c C-w</kbd><dd>Split the current window horizontally so that it is

ruler momentarily above the current line.  The comment ruler is two lines
of text that show you the locations of columns with special significance in
Fortran programs.  Square brackets show the limits of the columns for line
numbers, and curly brackets show the limits of the columns for the
statement body.  Column numbers appear above them.

   <p>Note that the column numbers count from zero, as always in GNU Emacs. 
As a result, the numbers may be one less than those you are familiar
with; but the positions they indicate in the line are standard for
Fortran.

   <p><a name="index-fortran_002dcolumn_002druler_002dfixed-2767"></a><a name="index-fortran_002dcolumn_002druler_002dtabs-2768"></a>  The text used to display the column ruler depends on the value of the
variable <code>indent-tabs-mode</code>.  If <code>indent-tabs-mode</code> is
<code>nil</code>, then the value of the variable
<code>fortran-column-ruler-fixed</code> is used as the column ruler. 
Otherwise, the value of the variable <code>fortran-column-ruler-tab</code> is
displayed.  By changing these variables, you can change the column ruler
display.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dw-_0040r_007b_0028Fortran-mode_0029_007d-2769"></a><a name="index-fortran_002dwindow_002dcreate_002dmomentarily-2770"></a>  <kbd>C-c C-w</kbd> (<code>fortran-window-create-momentarily</code>) temporarily
splits the current window horizontally, making a window
<code>fortran-line-length</code> columns wide, so you can see any lines that
are too long.  Type a space to restore the normal width.

   <p><a name="index-C_002du-C_002dc-C_002dw-_0040r_007b_0028Fortran-mode_0029_007d-2771"></a><a name="index-fortran_002dwindow_002dcreate-2772"></a>  You can also split the window horizontally and continue editing with
the split in place.  To do this, use <kbd>C-u C-c C-w</kbd> (<code>M-x
fortran-window-create</code>).  By editing in this window you can
immediately see when you make a line too wide to be correct Fortran.

   <p><a name="index-fortran_002dstrip_002dsequence_002dnos-2773"></a>  The command <kbd>M-x fortran-strip-sequence-nos</kbd> deletes all text in
column <code>fortran-line-length</code> and beyond, on all lines in the
current buffer.  This is the easiest way to get rid of old sequence
numbers.

<h4 class="subsection">26.14.6 Fortran Keyword Abbrevs</h4>

<p>Fortran mode provides many built-in abbrevs for common keywords and
declarations.  These are the same sort of abbrev that you can define
yourself.  To use them, you must turn on Abbrev mode. 
See <a href="#Abbrevs">Abbrevs</a>.

   <p>The built-in abbrevs are unusual in one way: they all start with a
semicolon.  For example, one built-in Fortran abbrev is `<samp><span class="samp">;c</span></samp>' for
`<samp><span class="samp">continue</span></samp>'.  If you insert `<samp><span class="samp">;c</span></samp>' and then insert a punctuation
character such as a space or a newline, the `<samp><span class="samp">;c</span></samp>' expands automatically
to `<samp><span class="samp">continue</span></samp>', provided Abbrev mode is enabled.

   <p>Type `<samp><span class="samp">;?</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">;C-h</span></samp>' to display a list of all the built-in
Fortran abbrevs and what they stand for.

<h3 class="section">27.1 Running Compilations under Emacs</h3>

<p><a name="index-inferior-process-2777"></a><a name="index-make-2778"></a><a name="index-compilation-errors-2779"></a><a name="index-error-log-2780"></a>
  Emacs can run compilers for languages such as C and Fortran, feeding
the compilation log into an Emacs buffer.  It can also parse the error
messages and show you where the errors occurred.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-x compile</kbd><dd>Run a compiler asynchronously under Emacs, with error messages going to
the <samp><span class="file">*compilation*</span></samp> buffer. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x recompile</kbd><dd>Invoke a compiler with the same command as in the last invocation of
<kbd>M-x compile</kbd>. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x kill-compilation</kbd><dd>Kill the running compilation subprocess. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-compile-2781"></a>  To run <code>make</code> or another compilation command, type <kbd>M-x
compile</kbd>.  This reads a shell command line using the minibuffer, and
then executes the command by running a shell as a subprocess (or
<dfn>inferior process</dfn>) of Emacs.  The output is inserted in a buffer
named <samp><span class="file">*compilation*</span></samp>.  The current buffer's default directory is
used as the working directory for the execution of the command;
normally, therefore, compilation takes place in this directory.

   <p><a name="index-compile_002dcommand-2782"></a>  The default compilation command is `<samp><span class="samp">make -k</span></samp>', which is usually
correct for programs compiled using the <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> utility (the
`<samp><span class="samp">-k</span></samp>' flag tells <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> to continue compiling as much as
possible after an error).  See <a href="make.html#Top">Make</a>. 
If you have done <kbd>M-x compile</kbd> before, the command that you
specified is automatically stored in the variable
<code>compile-command</code>; this is used as the default the next time you
type <kbd>M-x compile</kbd>.  A file can also specify a file-local value
for <code>compile-command</code> (see <a href="#File-Variables">File Variables</a>).

   <p>Starting a compilation displays the <samp><span class="file">*compilation*</span></samp> buffer in
another window but does not select it.  While the compilation is
running, the word `<samp><span class="samp">run</span></samp>' is shown in the major mode indicator for
the <samp><span class="file">*compilation*</span></samp> buffer, and the word `<samp><span class="samp">Compiling</span></samp>' appears
in all mode lines.  You do not have to keep the <samp><span class="file">*compilation*</span></samp>
buffer visible while compilation is running; it continues in any case. 
When the compilation ends, for whatever reason, the mode line of the
<samp><span class="file">*compilation*</span></samp> buffer changes to say `<samp><span class="samp">exit</span></samp>' (followed by
the exit code: `<samp><span class="samp">[0]</span></samp>' for a normal exit), or `<samp><span class="samp">signal</span></samp>' (if a
signal terminated the process).

   <p>If you want to watch the compilation transcript as it appears,
switch to the <samp><span class="file">*compilation*</span></samp> buffer and move point to the end of
the buffer.  When point is at the end, new compilation output is
inserted above point, which remains at the end.  Otherwise, point
remains fixed while compilation output is added at the end of the
buffer.

   <p><a name="index-compilation-buffer_002c-keeping-point-at-end-2783"></a><a name="index-compilation_002dscroll_002doutput-2784"></a>  If you change the variable <code>compilation-scroll-output</code> to a
non-<code>nil</code> value, the <samp><span class="file">*compilation*</span></samp> buffer scrolls
automatically to follow the output.  If the value is
<code>first-error</code>, scrolling stops when the first error appears,
leaving point at that error.  For any other non-<code>nil</code> value,
scrolling continues until there is no more output.

   <p><a name="index-recompile-2785"></a>  To rerun the last compilation with the same command, type <kbd>M-x
recompile</kbd>.  This reuses the compilation command from the last
invocation of <kbd>M-x compile</kbd>.  It also reuses the
<samp><span class="file">*compilation*</span></samp> buffer and starts the compilation in its default
directory, which is the directory in which the previous compilation
was started.

   <p><a name="index-kill_002dcompilation-2786"></a><a name="index-compilation_002dalways_002dkill-2787"></a>  Starting a new compilation also kills any compilation already
running in <samp><span class="file">*compilation*</span></samp>, as the buffer can only handle one
compilation at any time.  However, <kbd>M-x compile</kbd> asks for
confirmation before actually killing a compilation that is running; to
always automatically kill the compilation without asking, change the
variable <code>compilation-always-kill</code> to <code>t</code>.  You can also
kill a compilation process with the command <kbd>M-x
kill-compilation</kbd>.

   <p>To run two compilations at once, start the first one, then rename
the <samp><span class="file">*compilation*</span></samp> buffer (perhaps using <code>rename-uniquely</code>;
see <a href="#Misc-Buffer">Misc Buffer</a>), then switch buffers and start the other
compilation.  This will create a new <samp><span class="file">*compilation*</span></samp> buffer.

   <p><a name="index-compilation_002denvironment-2788"></a>  You can control the environment passed to the compilation command
with the variable <code>compilation-environment</code>.  Its value is a list
of environment variable settings; each element should be a string of
the form <code>"</code><var>envvarname</var><code>=</code><var>value</var><code>"</code>.  These environment
variable settings override the usual ones.

<h3 class="section">27.2 Compilation Mode</h3>

<p><a name="index-Compilation-mode-2789"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Compilation-2790"></a><a name="index-locus-2791"></a>  The <samp><span class="file">*compilation*</span></samp> buffer uses a major mode called Compilation
mode.  Compilation mode turns each error message in the buffer into a
hyperlink; you can move point to it and type &lt;RET&gt;, or click on it
with the mouse (see <a href="#Mouse-References">Mouse References</a>), to visit the <dfn>locus</dfn> of
the error message in a separate window.  The locus is the specific
position in a file where that error occurred.

   <p><a name="index-compile_002dgoto_002derror-2792"></a><a name="index-compilation_002dauto_002djump_002dto_002dfirst_002derror-2793"></a>  If you change the variable
<code>compilation-auto-jump-to-first-error</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> value,
Emacs automatically visits the locus of the first error message that
appears in the <samp><span class="file">*compilation*</span></samp> buffer.

   <p>Compilation mode provides the following additional commands.  These
commands can also be used in <samp><span class="file">*grep*</span></samp> buffers, where the
hyperlinks are search matches rather than error messages (see <a href="#Grep-Searching">Grep Searching</a>).

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-g M-n</kbd><dt><kbd>M-g n</kbd><dt><kbd>C-x `</kbd><dd>Visit the locus of the next error message or match (<code>next-error</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-g M-p</kbd><dt><kbd>M-g p</kbd><dd>Visit the locus of the previous error message or match
(<code>previous-error</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-n</kbd><dd>Move point to the next error message or match, without visiting its
locus (<code>compilation-next-error</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-p</kbd><dd>Move point to the previous error message or match, without visiting
its locus (<code>compilation-previous-error</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-}</kbd><dd>Move point to the next error message or match occurring in a different
file (<code>compilation-next-file</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-{</kbd><dd>Move point to the previous error message or match occurring in a
different file (<code>compilation-previous-file</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-c C-f</kbd><dd>Toggle Next Error Follow minor mode, which makes cursor motion in the
compilation buffer produce automatic source display. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-M_002dg-M_002dn-2794"></a><a name="index-M_002dg-n-2795"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-_0060-2796"></a><a name="index-next_002derror-2797"></a><a name="index-next_002derror_002dhighlight-2798"></a>  To visit errors sequentially, type <kbd>C-x&nbsp;`</kbd><!-- /@w -->
(<code>next-error</code>), or equivalently <kbd>M-g M-n</kbd> or <kbd>M-g n</kbd>. 
This command can be invoked from any buffer, not just a Compilation
mode buffer.  The first time you invoke it after a compilation, it
visits the locus of the first error message.  Each subsequent
<kbd>C-x&nbsp;`</kbd><!-- /@w --> visits the next error, in a similar fashion.  If you
visit a specific error with &lt;RET&gt; or a mouse click in the
<samp><span class="file">*compilation*</span></samp> buffer, subsequent <kbd>C-x&nbsp;`</kbd><!-- /@w --> commands
advance from there.  When <kbd>C-x&nbsp;`</kbd><!-- /@w --> finds no more error messages
to visit, it signals an error.  <kbd>C-u&nbsp;C-x&nbsp;`</kbd><!-- /@w --> starts again from
the beginning of the compilation buffer, and visits the first locus.

   <p><kbd>M-g M-p</kbd> or <kbd>M-g p</kbd> (<code>previous-error</code>) iterates
through errors in the opposite direction.

   <p>The <code>next-error</code> and <code>previous-error</code> commands don't just
act on the errors or matches listed in <samp><span class="file">*compilation*</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">*grep*</span></samp> buffers; they also know how to iterate through error or
match lists produced by other commands, such as <kbd>M-x occur</kbd>
(see <a href="#Other-Repeating-Search">Other Repeating Search</a>).  If you are already in a buffer
containing error messages or matches, those are the ones that are
iterated through; otherwise, Emacs looks for a buffer containing error
messages or matches amongst the windows of the selected frame, then
for one that <code>next-error</code> or <code>previous-error</code> previously
iterated through, and finally amongst all other buffers.  If the
buffer chosen for iterating through is not currently displayed in a
window, it will be displayed.

   <p><a name="index-compilation_002dskip_002dthreshold-2799"></a>  By default, the <code>next-error</code> and <code>previous-error</code> commands
skip less important messages.  The variable
<code>compilation-skip-threshold</code> controls this.  The default value,
1, means to skip anything less important than a warning.  A value of 2
means to skip anything less important than an error, while 0 means not
to skip any messages.

   <p>When Emacs visits the locus of an error message, it momentarily
highlights the relevant source line.  The duration of this highlight
is determined by the variable <code>next-error-highlight</code>.

   <p><a name="index-compilation_002dcontext_002dlines-2800"></a>  If the <samp><span class="file">*compilation*</span></samp> buffer is shown in a window with a left
fringe (see <a href="#Fringes">Fringes</a>), the locus-visiting commands put an arrow in
the fringe, pointing to the current error message.  If the window has
no left fringe, such as on a text terminal, these commands scroll the
window so that the current message is at the top of the window.  If
you change the variable <code>compilation-context-lines</code> to an integer
value <var>n</var>, these commands scroll the window so that the current
error message is <var>n</var> lines from the top, whether or not there is a
fringe; the default value, <code>nil</code>, gives the behavior described
above.

   <p><a name="index-compilation_002derror_002dregexp_002dalist-2801"></a><a name="index-grep_002dregexp_002dalist-2802"></a>  To parse messages from the compiler, Compilation mode uses the
variable <code>compilation-error-regexp-alist</code> which lists various
error message formats and tells Emacs how to extract the locus from
each.  A similar variable, <code>grep-regexp-alist</code>, tells Emacs how
to parse output from a <code>grep</code> command (see <a href="#Grep-Searching">Grep Searching</a>).

   <p><a name="index-compilation_002dnext_002derror-2803"></a><a name="index-compilation_002dprevious_002derror-2804"></a><a name="index-compilation_002dnext_002dfile-2805"></a><a name="index-compilation_002dprevious_002dfile-2806"></a>  Compilation mode also defines the keys &lt;SPC&gt; and &lt;DEL&gt; to
scroll by screenfuls; <kbd>M-n</kbd> (<code>compilation-next-error</code>) and
<kbd>M-p</kbd> (<code>compilation-previous-error</code>) to move to the next or
previous error message; and <kbd>M-{</kbd> (<code>compilation-next-file</code>)
and <kbd>M-}</kbd> (<code>compilation-previous-file</code>) to move to the next
or previous error message for a different source file.

   <p><a name="index-Next-Error-Follow-mode-2807"></a><a name="index-next_002derror_002dfollow_002dminor_002dmode-2808"></a>  You can type <kbd>C-c C-f</kbd> to toggle Next Error Follow mode.  In
this minor mode, ordinary cursor motion in the compilation buffer
automatically updates the source buffer, i.e., moving the cursor over
an error message causes the locus of that error to be displayed.

   <p>The features of Compilation mode are also available in a minor mode
called Compilation Minor mode.  This lets you parse error messages in
any buffer, not just a normal compilation output buffer.  Type
<kbd>M-x compilation-minor-mode</kbd> to enable the minor mode.  For
instance, in an Rlogin buffer (see <a href="#Remote-Host">Remote Host</a>), Compilation minor
mode automatically accesses remote source files by FTP (see <a href="#File-Names">File Names</a>).

<h3 class="section">27.3 Subshells for Compilation</h3>

<p>The <kbd>M-x compile</kbd> command uses a shell to run the compilation
command, but specifies the option for a noninteractive shell.  This
means, in particular, that the shell should start with no prompt.  If
you find your usual shell prompt making an unsightly appearance in the
<samp><span class="file">*compilation*</span></samp> buffer, it means you have made a mistake in your
shell's init file by setting the prompt unconditionally.  (This init
file may be named <samp><span class="file">.bashrc</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">.profile</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">.cshrc</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="file">.shrc</span></samp>, etc., depending on what shell you use.)  The shell init
file should set the prompt only if there already is a prompt.  Here's
how to do it in bash:

<pre class="example">     if [ "${PS1+set}" = set ]
     then PS1=...
     fi
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">And here's how to do it in csh:

<pre class="example">     if ($?prompt) set prompt = ...
</pre>
   <p>Emacs does not expect a compiler process to launch asynchronous
subprocesses; if it does, and they keep running after the main
compiler process has terminated, Emacs may kill them or their output
may not arrive in Emacs.  To avoid this problem, make the main
compilation process wait for its subprocesses to finish.  In a shell
script, you can do this using `<samp><span class="samp">$!</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">wait</span></samp>', like this:

<pre class="example">     (sleep 10; echo 2nd)&amp; pid=$!  # <span class="roman">Record pid of subprocess</span>
     echo first message
     wait $pid                     # <span class="roman">Wait for subprocess</span>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If the background process does not output to the compilation buffer,
so you only need to prevent it from being killed when the main
compilation process terminates, this is sufficient:

<pre class="example">     nohup <var>command</var>; sleep 1
</pre>
   <p>On MS-DOS, asynchronous subprocesses are
not supported, so <kbd>M-x compile</kbd> runs the compilation command
synchronously (i.e., you must wait until the command finishes before
you can do anything else in Emacs).  See <a href="#MS_002dDOS">MS-DOS</a>.

<h3 class="section">27.4 Searching with Grep under Emacs</h3>

<p>Just as you can run a compiler from Emacs and then visit the lines
with compilation errors, you can also run <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp> and then
visit the lines on which matches were found.  This works by treating
the matches reported by <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp> as if they were errors. 
The output buffer uses Grep mode, which is a variant of Compilation
mode (see <a href="#Compilation-Mode">Compilation Mode</a>).

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-x grep</kbd><dt><kbd>M-x lgrep</kbd><dd>Run <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp> asynchronously under Emacs, listing matching lines in
the buffer named <samp><span class="file">*grep*</span></samp>. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x grep-find</kbd><dt><kbd>M-x find-grep</kbd><dt><kbd>M-x rgrep</kbd><dd>Run <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp> via <code>find</code>, and collect output in the
<samp><span class="file">*grep*</span></samp> buffer. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x zrgrep</kbd><dd>Run <code>zgrep</code> and collect output in the <samp><span class="file">*grep*</span></samp> buffer. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x kill-grep</kbd><dd>Kill the running <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp> subprocess. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-grep-2809"></a>  To run <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp>, type <kbd>M-x grep</kbd>, then enter a command line
that specifies how to run <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp>.  Use the same arguments you
would give <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp> when running it normally: a <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp>-style
regexp (usually in single-quotes to quote the shell's special
characters) followed by file names, which may use wildcards.  If you
specify a prefix argument for <kbd>M-x grep</kbd>, it finds the identifier
(see <a href="#Xref">Xref</a>) in the buffer around point, and puts that into the
default <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp> command.

   <p>Your command need not simply run <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp>; you can use any shell
command that produces output in the same format.  For instance, you
can chain <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp> commands, like this:

<pre class="example">     grep -nH -e foo *.el | grep bar | grep toto
</pre>
   <p>The output from <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp> goes in the <samp><span class="file">*grep*</span></samp> buffer.  You
can find the corresponding lines in the original files using <kbd>C-x&nbsp;`</kbd><!-- /@w -->, &lt;RET&gt;, and so forth, just like compilation errors.

   <p>Some grep programs accept a `<samp><span class="samp">--color</span></samp>' option to output special
markers around matches for the purpose of highlighting.  You can make
use of this feature by setting <code>grep-highlight-matches</code> to
<code>t</code>.  When displaying a match in the source buffer, the exact
match will be highlighted, instead of the entire source line.

   <p><a name="index-grep_002dfind-2810"></a><a name="index-find_002dgrep-2811"></a>  The command <kbd>M-x grep-find</kbd> (also available as <kbd>M-x
find-grep</kbd>) is similar to <kbd>M-x grep</kbd>, but it supplies a different
initial default for the command&mdash;one that runs both <code>find</code> and
<samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp>, so as to search every file in a directory tree.  See also
the <code>find-grep-dired</code> command, in <a href="#Dired-and-Find">Dired and Find</a>.

   <p><a name="index-lgrep-2812"></a><a name="index-rgrep-2813"></a><a name="index-zrgrep-2814"></a>  The commands <kbd>M-x lgrep</kbd> (local grep) and <kbd>M-x rgrep</kbd>
(recursive grep) are more user-friendly versions of <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp> and
<code>grep-find</code>, which prompt separately for the regular expression
to match, the files to search, and the base directory for the search. 
Case sensitivity of the search is controlled by the current value of
<code>case-fold-search</code>.  The command <kbd>M-x zrgrep</kbd> is similar to
<kbd>M-x rgrep</kbd>, but it calls <samp><span class="command">zgrep</span></samp> instead of
<samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp> to search the contents of gzipped files.

   <p>These commands build the shell commands based on the variables
<code>grep-template</code> (for <code>lgrep</code>) and <code>grep-find-template</code>
(for <code>rgrep</code>).  The files to search can use aliases defined in
the variable <code>grep-files-aliases</code>.

   <p><a name="index-grep_002dfind_002dignored_002ddirectories-2815"></a>  Directories listed in the variable
<code>grep-find-ignored-directories</code> are automatically skipped by
<kbd>M-x rgrep</kbd>.  The default value includes the data directories used
by various version control systems.

<h3 class="section">27.5 Finding Syntax Errors On The Fly</h3>

<p><a name="index-checking-syntax-2816"></a>
  Flymake mode is a minor mode that performs on-the-fly syntax
checking for many programming and markup languages, including C, C++,
Perl, HTML, and TeX/LaTeX.  It is somewhat analogous to Flyspell
mode, which performs spell checking for ordinary human languages in a
similar fashion (see <a href="#Spelling">Spelling</a>).  As you edit a file, Flymake mode
runs an appropriate syntax checking tool in the background, using a
temporary copy of the buffer.  It then parses the error and warning
messages, and highlights the erroneous lines in the buffer.  The
syntax checking tool used depends on the language; for example, for
C/C++ files this is usually the C compiler.  Flymake can also use
build tools such as <code>make</code> for checking complicated projects.

   <p>To enable Flymake mode, type <kbd>M-x flymake-mode</kbd>.  You can jump
to the errors that it finds by using <kbd>M-x flymake-goto-next-error</kbd>
and <kbd>M-x flymake-goto-prev-error</kbd>.  To display any error messages
associated with the current line, type <kbd>M-x
flymake-display-err-menu-for-current-line</kbd>.

The GUD (Grand Unified Debugger) library provides an Emacs interface
to a wide variety of symbolic debuggers.  It can run the GNU Debugger
(GDB), as well as DBX, SDB, XDB, Perl's debugging mode, the Python
debugger PDB, and the Java Debugger JDB.

   <p>Emacs provides a special interface to GDB, which uses extra Emacs
windows to display the state of the debugged program.  See <a href="#GDB-Graphical-Interface">GDB Graphical Interface</a>.

   <p>Emacs also has a built-in debugger for Emacs Lisp programs. 
See <a href="elisp.html#Debugging">The Lisp Debugger</a>.

<h4 class="subsection">27.6.1 Starting GUD</h4>

<p>There are several commands for starting a debugger subprocess, each
corresponding to a particular debugger program.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-x gdb</kbd><dd><a name="index-gdb-2826"></a>Run GDB as a subprocess, and interact with it via an IDE-like Emacs
interface.  See <a href="#GDB-Graphical-Interface">GDB Graphical Interface</a>, for more information about
this command.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x gud-gdb</kbd><dd><a name="index-gud_002dgdb-2827"></a>Run GDB, using a GUD interaction buffer for input and output to the
GDB subprocess (see <a href="#Debugger-Operation">Debugger Operation</a>).  If such a buffer already
exists, switch to it; otherwise, create the buffer and switch to it.

     <p>The other commands in this list do the same, for other debugger
programs.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x perldb</kbd><dd><a name="index-perldb-2828"></a>Run the Perl interpreter in debug mode.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x jdb</kbd><dd><a name="index-jdb-2829"></a>Run the Java debugger.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x pdb</kbd><dd><a name="index-pdb-2830"></a>Run the Python debugger.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x dbx</kbd><dd><a name="index-dbx-2831"></a>Run the DBX debugger.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x xdb</kbd><dd><a name="index-xdb-2832"></a><a name="index-gud_002dxdb_002ddirectories-2833"></a>Run the XDB debugger.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x sdb</kbd><dd><a name="index-sdb-2834"></a>Run the SDB debugger. 
</dl>

   <p>Each of these commands reads a command line to invoke the debugger,
using the minibuffer.  The minibuffer's initial contents contain the
standard executable name and options for the debugger, and sometimes
also a guess for the name of the executable file you want to debug. 
Shell wildcards and variables are not allowed in this command line. 
Emacs assumes that the first command argument which does not start
with a `<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>' is the executable file name.

   <p><a name="index-remote-host_002c-debugging-on-2835"></a>  Tramp provides a facility for remote debugging, whereby both the
debugger and the program being debugged are on the same remote host. 
See <a href="tramp.html#Running-a-debugger-on-a-remote-host">Running a debugger on a remote host</a>,
for details.  This is separate from GDB's remote debugging feature,
where the program and the debugger run on different machines
(see <a href="gdb.html#Remote-Debugging">Debugging Remote Programs</a>).

<h4 class="subsection">27.6.2 Debugger Operation</h4>

<p><a name="index-GUD-interaction-buffer-2836"></a>
  The <dfn>GUD interaction buffer</dfn> is an Emacs buffer which is used to
send text commands to a debugger subprocess, and record its output. 
This is the basic interface for interacting with a debugger, used by
<kbd>M-x gud-gdb</kbd> and other commands listed in
<a href="#Starting-GUD">Starting GUD</a>. 
The <kbd>M-x gdb</kbd> command extends this interface with additional
specialized buffers for controlling breakpoints, stack frames, and
other aspects of the debugger state (see <a href="#GDB-Graphical-Interface">GDB Graphical Interface</a>).

   <p>The GUD interaction buffer uses a variant of Shell mode, so the
Emacs commands defined by Shell mode are available (see <a href="#Shell-Mode">Shell Mode</a>).  Completion is available for most debugger commands
(see <a href="#Completion">Completion</a>), and you can use the usual Shell mode history
commands to repeat them. 
See <a href="#Commands-of-GUD">Commands of GUD</a>,
for special commands that can be used in the GUD interaction buffer.

   <p>As you debug a program, Emacs displays the relevant source files by
visiting them in Emacs buffers, with an arrow in the left fringe
indicating the current execution line.  (On a text terminal, the arrow
appears as `<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>', overlaid on the first two text columns.)  Moving
point in such a buffer does not move the arrow.  You are free to edit
these source files, but note that inserting or deleting lines will
throw off the arrow's positioning, as Emacs has no way to figure out
which edited source line corresponds to the line reported by the
debugger subprocess.  To update this information, you typically have
to recompile and restart the program.

   <p><a name="index-GUD-Tooltip-mode-2837"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-GUD-Tooltip-2838"></a><a name="index-gud_002dtooltip_002dmode-2839"></a><a name="index-gud_002dtooltip_002decho_002darea-2840"></a>  GUD Tooltip mode is a global minor mode that adds tooltip support to
GUD.  To toggle this mode, type <kbd>M-x gud-tooltip-mode</kbd>.  It is
disabled by default.  If enabled, you can move the mouse cursor over a
variable, a function, or a macro (collectively called
<dfn>identifiers</dfn>) to show their values in tooltips
(see <a href="#Tooltips">Tooltips</a>).  Alternatively, mark an identifier or an
expression by dragging the mouse over it, then leave the mouse in the
marked area to have the value of the expression displayed in a
tooltip.  The GUD Tooltip mode takes effect in the GUD interaction
buffer, and in all source buffers with major modes listed in the
variable <code>gud-tooltip-modes</code>.  If the variable
<code>gud-tooltip-echo-area</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, or if you turned off
the tooltip mode, values are shown in the echo area instead of a
tooltip.

   <p>When using GUD Tooltip mode with <kbd>M-x gud-gdb</kbd>, displaying an
expression's value in GDB can sometimes expand a macro, potentially
causing side effects in the debugged program.  For that reason, using
tooltips in <code>gud-gdb</code> is disabled.  If you use the <kbd>M-x gdb</kbd>
interface, this problem does not occur, as there is special code to
avoid side-effects; furthermore, you can display macro definitions
associated with an identifier when the program is not executing.

<h4 class="subsection">27.6.3 Commands of GUD</h4>

<p>GUD provides commands for setting and clearing breakpoints,
selecting stack frames, and stepping through the program.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x C-a C-b</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002da-C_002db-2841"></a>Set a breakpoint on the source line that point is on. 
</dl>

   <p><kbd>C-x C-a C-b</kbd> (<code>gud-break</code>), when called in a source
buffer, sets a debugger breakpoint on the current source line.  This
command is available only after starting GUD.  If you call it in a
buffer that is not associated with any debugger subprocess, it signals
a error.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002da-_0040r_007b_0028GUD_0029_007d-2842"></a>  The following commands are available both in the GUD interaction
buffer and globally, but with different key bindings.  The keys
starting with <kbd>C-c</kbd> are available only in the GUD interaction
buffer, while those starting with <kbd>C-x C-a</kbd> are available
globally.  Some of these commands are also available via the tool bar;
some are not supported by certain debuggers.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-c C-l</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dl-_0040r_007b_0028GUD_0029_007d-2843"></a><dt><kbd>C-x C-a C-l</kbd><dd><a name="index-gud_002drefresh-2844"></a>Display, in another window, the last source line referred to in the
GUD interaction buffer (<code>gud-refresh</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-s</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002ds-_0040r_007b_0028GUD_0029_007d-2845"></a><dt><kbd>C-x C-a C-s</kbd><dd><a name="index-gud_002dstep-2846"></a>Execute the next single line of code (<code>gud-step</code>).  If the line
contains a function call, execution stops after entering the called
function.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-n</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dn-_0040r_007b_0028GUD_0029_007d-2847"></a><dt><kbd>C-x C-a C-n</kbd><dd><a name="index-gud_002dnext-2848"></a>Execute the next single line of code, stepping across function calls
without stopping inside the functions (<code>gud-next</code>).

does not print the exact expression that you want, mark it as a region
first.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-r</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dr-_0040r_007b_0028GUD_0029_007d-2853"></a><dt><kbd>C-x C-a C-r</kbd><dd><a name="index-gud_002dcont-2854"></a>Continue execution without specifying any stopping point.  The program
will run until it hits a breakpoint, terminates, or gets a signal that
the debugger is checking for (<code>gud-cont</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-d</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dd-_0040r_007b_0028GUD_0029_007d-2855"></a><dt><kbd>C-x C-a C-d</kbd><dd><a name="index-gud_002dremove-2856"></a>Delete the breakpoint(s) on the current source line, if any
(<code>gud-remove</code>).  If you use this command in the GUD interaction
buffer, it applies to the line where the program last stopped.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-t</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dt-_0040r_007b_0028GUD_0029_007d-2857"></a><dt><kbd>C-x C-a C-t</kbd><dd><a name="index-gud_002dtbreak-2858"></a>Set a temporary breakpoint on the current source line, if any
(<code>gud-tbreak</code>).  If you use this command in the GUD interaction
buffer, it applies to the line where the program last stopped.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c &lt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dc-_003c-_0040r_007b_0028GUD_0029_007d-2859"></a><dt><kbd>C-x C-a &lt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-gud_002dup-2860"></a>Select the next enclosing stack frame (<code>gud-up</code>).  This is
equivalent to the GDB command `<samp><span class="samp">up</span></samp>'.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c &gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dc-_003e-_0040r_007b_0028GUD_0029_007d-2861"></a><dt><kbd>C-x C-a &gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-gud_002ddown-2862"></a>Select the next inner stack frame (<code>gud-down</code>).  This is
equivalent to the GDB command `<samp><span class="samp">down</span></samp>'.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-u</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002du-_0040r_007b_0028GUD_0029_007d-2863"></a><dt><kbd>C-x C-a C-u</kbd><dd><a name="index-gud_002duntil-2864"></a>Continue execution to the current line (<code>gud-until</code>).  The
program will run until it hits a breakpoint, terminates, gets a signal
that the debugger is checking for, or reaches the line on which the
cursor currently sits.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-f</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002df-_0040r_007b_0028GUD_0029_007d-2865"></a><dt><kbd>C-x C-a C-f</kbd><dd><a name="index-gud_002dfinish-2866"></a>Run the program until the selected stack frame returns or
stops for some other reason (<code>gud-finish</code>). 
</dl>

   <p>If you are using GDB, these additional key bindings are available:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x C-a C-j</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002da-C_002dj-_0040r_007b_0028GUD_0029_007d-2867"></a><a name="index-gud_002djump-2868"></a>Only useful in a source buffer, <code>gud-jump</code> transfers the
program's execution point to the current line.  In other words, the
next line that the program executes will be the one where you gave the
command.  If the new execution line is in a different function from
the previously one, GDB prompts for confirmation since the results may
be bizarre.  See the GDB manual entry regarding <code>jump</code> for
details.

     <br><dt><kbd>&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-TAB-_0040r_007b_0028GUD_0029_007d-2869"></a><a name="index-gud_002dgdb_002dcomplete_002dcommand-2870"></a>With GDB, complete a symbol name (<code>gud-gdb-complete-command</code>). 
This key is available only in the GUD interaction buffer. 
</dl>

   <p>These commands interpret a numeric argument as a repeat count, when
that makes sense.

   <p>Because &lt;TAB&gt; serves as a completion command, you can't use it to
enter a tab as input to the program you are debugging with GDB. 
Instead, type <kbd>C-q &lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> to enter a tab.

<code>gdb-mode-hook</code>, if you are using GDB; <code>dbx-mode-hook</code>, if
you are using DBX; <code>sdb-mode-hook</code>, if you are using SDB;
<code>xdb-mode-hook</code>, if you are using XDB; <code>perldb-mode-hook</code>,
for Perl debugging mode; <code>pdb-mode-hook</code>, for PDB;
<code>jdb-mode-hook</code>, for JDB.  See <a href="#Hooks">Hooks</a>.

   <p>The <code>gud-def</code> Lisp macro (see <a href="elisp.html#Defining-Macros">Defining Macros</a>) provides a convenient way to define an
Emacs command that sends a particular command string to the debugger,
and set up a key binding for in the GUD interaction buffer:

   <p><a name="index-gud_002ddef-2878"></a>
<pre class="example">     (gud-def <var>function</var> <var>cmdstring</var> <var>binding</var> <var>docstring</var>)
</pre>
   <p>This defines a command named <var>function</var> which sends
<var>cmdstring</var> to the debugger process, and gives it the documentation
string <var>docstring</var>.  You can then use the command <var>function</var> in any
buffer.  If <var>binding</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, <code>gud-def</code> also binds
the command to <kbd>C-c </kbd><var>binding</var> in the GUD buffer's mode and to
<kbd>C-x C-a </kbd><var>binding</var> generally.

   <p>The command string <var>cmdstring</var> may contain certain
`<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>'-sequences that stand for data to be filled in at the time
<var>function</var> is called:

     <dl>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">%f</span></samp>'<dd>The name of the current source file.  If the current buffer is the GUD
buffer, then the current source file is the file that the program
stopped in.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">%l</span></samp>'<dd>The number of the current source line.  If the current buffer is the GUD
buffer, then the current source line is the line that the program
stopped in.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">%e</span></samp>'<dd>In transient-mark-mode the text in the region, if it is active. 
Otherwise the text of the C lvalue or function-call expression at or
adjacent to point.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">%a</span></samp>'<dd>The text of the hexadecimal address at or adjacent to point.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">%p</span></samp>'<dd>The numeric argument of the called function, as a decimal number.  If
the command is used without a numeric argument, `<samp><span class="samp">%p</span></samp>' stands for the
empty string.

     <p>If you don't use `<samp><span class="samp">%p</span></samp>' in the command string, the command you define
ignores any numeric argument.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">%d</span></samp>'<dd>The name of the directory of the current source file.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">%c</span></samp>'<dd>Fully qualified class name derived from the expression surrounding point

<p>The command <kbd>M-x gdb</kbd> starts GDB in an IDE-like interface, with
specialized buffers for controlling breakpoints, stack frames, and
other aspects of the debugger state.  It also provides additional ways
to control the debugging session with the mouse, such as clicking in

within one Emacs session, as that is currently unsupported by <kbd>M-x
gdb</kbd>.

   <p>Internally, <kbd>M-x gdb</kbd> informs GDB that its screen size is
unlimited; for correct operation, you must not change GDB's screen
height and width values during the debugging session.

<a name="index-gdb_002dmany_002dwindows-2881"></a>  If the variable <code>gdb-many-windows</code> is <code>nil</code> (the default),
<kbd>M-x gdb</kbd> normally displays only the GUD interaction buffer. 
However, if the variable <code>gdb-show-main</code> is also non-<code>nil</code>,
it starts with two windows: one displaying the GUD interaction buffer,

   <p>If <code>gdb-many-windows</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, then <kbd>M-x gdb</kbd>

is the relevant buffer type, such as `<samp><span class="samp">breakpoints</span></samp>'.  You can do
the same with the menu bar, with the `<samp><span class="samp">GDB-Windows</span></samp>' and
`<samp><span class="samp">GDB-Frames</span></samp>' sub-menus of the `<samp><span class="samp">GUD</span></samp>' menu.

   <p>When you finish debugging, kill the GUD interaction buffer with
<kbd>C-x k</kbd>, which will also kill all the buffers associated with the
session.  However you need not do this if, after editing and
re-compiling your source code within Emacs, you wish to continue
debugging.  When you restart execution, GDB automatically finds the
new executable.  Keeping the GUD interaction buffer has the advantage
of keeping the shell history as well as GDB's breakpoints.  You do
need to check that the breakpoints in recently edited source files are
still in the right places.

</dl>

   <p>On a graphical display, you can click <kbd>mouse-1</kbd> in the fringe of
a source buffer, to set a breakpoint on that line (see <a href="#Fringes">Fringes</a>). 
A red dot appears in the fringe, where you clicked.  If a breakpoint
already exists there, the click removes it.  A <kbd>C-mouse-1</kbd> click
enables or disables an existing breakpoint; a breakpoint that is
disabled, but not unset, is indicated by a gray dot.

   <p>On a text terminal, or when fringes are disabled, enabled
breakpoints are indicated with a `<samp><span class="samp">B</span></samp>' character in the left margin
of the window.  Disabled breakpoints are indicated with `<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>'. 
(The margin is only displayed if a breakpoint is present.)

   <p>A solid arrow in the left fringe of a source buffer indicates the
line of the innermost frame where the debugged program has stopped.  A
hollow arrow indicates the current execution line of a higher-level
frame.  If you drag the arrow in the fringe with <kbd>mouse-1</kbd>, that
causes execution to advance to the line where you release the button. 
Alternatively, you can click <kbd>mouse-3</kbd> in the fringe to advance to
that line.  You can click <kbd>C-mouse-3</kbd> in the fringe to jump to
that line without executing the intermediate lines.  This command
allows you to go backwards, which can be useful for running through
code that has already executed, in order to examine its execution in
more detail.

<h5 class="subsubsection">27.6.5.3 Breakpoints Buffer</h5>

<p>The GDB Breakpoints buffer shows the breakpoints, watchpoints and
catchpoints in the debugger session.  See <a href="gdb.html#Breakpoints">Breakpoints</a>.  It provides the following commands, which mostly apply
to the <dfn>current breakpoint</dfn> (the breakpoint which point is on):

point there and press &lt;RET&gt; (<code>gdb-select-thread</code>), or click on
it with <kbd>mouse-2</kbd>.  This also displays the associated source
buffer, and updates the contents of the other GDB buffers.

   <p>You can customize variables under <code>gdb-buffers</code> group to select
fields included in GDB Threads buffer.

     <dl>

</dl>

<p class="noindent">Their upper-case counterparts, <kbd>D</kbd>, <kbd>F</kbd> ,<kbd>L</kbd> and <kbd>R</kbd>,
display the corresponding buffer in a new frame.

   <p>When you create a buffer showing information about some specific
thread, it becomes bound to that thread and keeps showing actual
information while you debug your program.  The mode indicator for each
GDB buffer shows the number of thread it is showing information about. 
The thread number is also included in the buffer name of bound
buffers.

   <p>Further commands are available in the GDB Threads buffer which
depend on the mode of GDB that is used for controlling execution of
your program.  See <a href="#Multithreaded-Debugging">Multithreaded Debugging</a>.

     <dl>
<dt>Locals Buffer<dd>This buffer displays the values of local variables of the current
frame for simple data types (see <a href="gdb.html#Frame-Info">Frame Info</a>).  Press &lt;RET&gt; or
click <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> on the value if you want to edit it.

     <p>Arrays and structures display their type only.  With GDB 6.4 or later,
you can examine the value of the local variable at point by typing
&lt;RET&gt;, or with a <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> click.  With earlier versions of
GDB, use &lt;RET&gt; or <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> on the type description
(`<samp><span class="samp">[struct/union]</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">[array]</span></samp>').  See <a href="#Watch-Expressions">Watch Expressions</a>.

     <br><dt>Registers Buffer<dd><a name="index-toggle_002dgdb_002dall_002dregisters-2907"></a>This buffer displays the values held by the registers
(see <a href="gdb.html#Registers">Registers</a>).  Press &lt;RET&gt; or
click <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> on a register if you want to edit its value.  With
GDB 6.4 or later, recently changed register values display with
<code>font-lock-warning-face</code>.

     <br><dt>Assembler Buffer<dd>The assembler buffer displays the current frame as machine code.  An
arrow points to the current instruction, and you can set and remove
breakpoints as in a source buffer.  Breakpoint icons also appear in
the fringe or margin.

     <br><dt>Memory Buffer<dd>The memory buffer lets you examine sections of program memory
(see <a href="gdb.html#Memory">Memory</a>). 
Click <kbd>mouse-1</kbd> on the appropriate part of the header line to
change the starting address or number of data items that the buffer
displays.  Alternatively, use <kbd>S</kbd> or <kbd>N</kbd> respectively.  Click
<kbd>mouse-3</kbd> on the header line to select the display format or unit
size for these data items. 
</dl>

   <p>When <code>gdb-many-windows</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, the locals buffer
shares its window with the registers buffer, just like breakpoints and
threads buffers.  To switch from one to the other, click with
<kbd>mouse-1</kbd> on the relevant button in the header line.

stops, move point into the variable name and click on the watch icon
in the tool bar (<code>gud-watch</code>) or type <kbd>C-x C-a C-w</kbd>.  If you
specify a prefix argument, you can enter the variable name in the
minibuffer.

   <p>Each watch expression is displayed in the speedbar
(see <a href="#Speedbar">Speedbar</a>).  Complex data types, such as arrays, structures
and unions are represented in a tree format.  Leaves and simple data
types show the name of the expression and its value and, when the
speedbar frame is selected, display the type as a tooltip.  Higher
levels show the name, type and address value for pointers and just the
name and type otherwise.  Root expressions also display the frame
address as a tooltip to help identify the frame in which they were
defined.

   <p>To expand or contract a complex data type, click <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> or
press &lt;SPC&gt; on the tag to the left of the expression.  Emacs asks
for confirmation before expanding the expression if its number of
immediate children exceeds the value of the variable
<code>gdb-max-children</code>.

   <p><a name="index-D-_0040r_007b_0028GDB-speedbar_0029_007d-2911"></a><a name="index-gdb_002dvar_002ddelete-2912"></a>  To delete a complex watch expression, move point to the root
expression in the speedbar and type <kbd>D</kbd> (<code>gdb-var-delete</code>).

   <p><a name="index-RET-_0040r_007b_0028GDB-speedbar_0029_007d-2913"></a><a name="index-gdb_002dedit_002dvalue-2914"></a>  To edit a variable with a simple data type, or a simple element of a
complex data type, move point there in the speedbar and type &lt;RET&gt;
(<code>gdb-edit-value</code>).  Or you can click <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> on a value to
edit it.  Either way, this reads the new value using the minibuffer.

   <p><a name="index-gdb_002dshow_002dchanged_002dvalues-2915"></a>  If you set the variable <code>gdb-show-changed-values</code> to
non-<code>nil</code> (the default value), Emacs uses
<code>font-lock-warning-face</code> to highlight values that have recently
changed and <code>shadow</code> face to make variables which have gone out of
scope less noticeable.  When a variable goes out of scope you can't
edit its value.

   <p><a name="index-gdb_002ddelete_002dout_002dof_002dscope-2916"></a>  If the variable <code>gdb-delete-out-of-scope</code> is non-<code>nil</code>
(the default value), Emacs automatically deletes watch expressions
which go out of scope.  Sometimes, when re-entering the same function,
it may be useful to set this value to <code>nil</code> so that you don't
need to recreate the watch expression.

   <p><a name="index-gdb_002duse_002dcolon_002dcolon_002dnotation-2917"></a>  If the variable <code>gdb-use-colon-colon-notation</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>, Emacs uses the `<samp><var>function</var><span class="samp">::</span><var>variable</var></samp>'
format.  This allows the user to display watch expressions which share
the same variable name.  The default value is <code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-gdb_002dspeedbar_002dauto_002draise-2918"></a>To automatically raise the speedbar every time the display of watch
expressions updates, set <code>gdb-speedbar-auto-raise</code> to
non-<code>nil</code>.  This can be useful if you are debugging with a full
screen Emacs frame.

<p><a name="index-Multithreaded-debugging-in-GDB-2919"></a><a name="index-Non_002dstop-debugging-in-GDB-2920"></a>
  In GDB's <dfn>all-stop mode</dfn>, whenever your program stops, all
execution threads stop.  Likewise, whenever you restart the program,
all threads start executing.  See <a href="gdb.html#All_002dStop-Mode">All-Stop Mode</a>.  For some multi-threaded targets, GDB supports
a further mode of operation, called <dfn>non-stop mode</dfn>, in which you
can examine stopped program threads in the debugger while other
threads continue to execute freely.  See <a href="gdb.html#Non_002dStop-Mode">Non-Stop Mode</a>.  Versions of GDB prior to 7.0 do not
support non-stop mode, and it does not work on all targets.

   <p><a name="index-gdb_002dnon_002dstop_002dsetting-2921"></a>  The variable <code>gdb-non-stop-setting</code> determines whether Emacs
runs GDB in all-stop mode or non-stop mode.  The default is <code>t</code>,
which means it tries to use non-stop mode if that is available.  If
you change the value to <code>nil</code>, or if non-stop mode is
unavailable, Emacs runs GDB in all-stop mode.  The variable takes
effect when Emacs begins a debugging session; if you change its value,
you should restart any active debugging session.

   <p><a name="index-gdb_002dswitch_002dwhen_002danother_002dstopped-2922"></a>  When a thread stops in non-stop mode, Emacs usually switches to that
thread.  If you don't want Emacs to do this switch if another stopped
thread is already selected, change the variable
<code>gdb-switch-when-another-stopped</code> to <code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-gdb_002dswitch_002dreasons-2923"></a>  Emacs can decide whether or not to switch to the stopped thread
depending on the reason which caused the stop.  Customize the variable
<code>gdb-switch-reasons</code> to select the stop reasons which will cause
a thread switch.

   <p><a name="index-gdb_002dstopped_002dfunctions-2924"></a>  The variable <code>gdb-stopped-functions</code> allows you to execute your
functions whenever some thread stops.

   <p>In non-stop mode, you can switch between different modes for GUD
execution control commands.

   <p><a name="index-gdb_002dgud_002dcontrol_002dall_002dthreads-2925"></a>
     <dl>
<dt><dfn>Non-stop/A</dfn><dd>
  When <code>gdb-gud-control-all-threads</code> is <code>t</code> (the default
value), interruption and continuation commands apply to all threads,
so you can halt or continue all your threads with one command using
<code>gud-stop-subjob</code> and <code>gud-cont</code>, respectively.  The
`<samp><span class="samp">Go</span></samp>' button is shown on the toolbar when at least one thread is
stopped, whereas `<samp><span class="samp">Stop</span></samp>' button is shown when at least one thread
is running.

     <br><dt><dfn>Non-stop/T</dfn><dd>
When <code>gdb-gud-control-all-threads</code> is <code>nil</code>, only the
current thread is stopped/continued.  `<samp><span class="samp">Go</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">Stop</span></samp>'
buttons on the GUD toolbar are shown depending on the state of current
thread. 
</dl>

   <p>You can change the current value of <code>gdb-gud-control-all-threads</code>
from the tool bar or from `<samp><span class="samp">GUD-&gt;GDB-MI</span></samp>' menu.

   <p>Stepping commands always apply to the current thread.

   <p>In non-stop mode, you can interrupt/continue your threads without
selecting them.  Hitting <kbd>i</kbd> in threads buffer interrupts thread
under point, <kbd>c</kbd> continues it, <kbd>s</kbd> steps through.  More such
commands may be added in the future.

   <p>Note that when you interrupt a thread, it stops with the
`<samp><span class="samp">signal received</span></samp>' reason.  If that reason is included in your
<code>gdb-switch-reasons</code> (it is by default), Emacs will switch to
that thread.

<h3 class="section">27.7 Executing Lisp Expressions</h3>

<p>Emacs has major modes for several variants of Lisp.  They use the

(see <a href="#Programs">Programs</a>).  In addition, they provide special commands for
executing Lisp expressions.

     <dl>
<dt>Emacs Lisp mode<dd>The mode for editing Emacs Lisp source files.  It defines <kbd>C-M-x</kbd>
to evaluate the current top-level Lisp expression.  See <a href="#Lisp-Eval">Lisp Eval</a>.

     <br><dt>Lisp Interaction mode<dd>The mode for an interactive Emacs Lisp session.  It defines <kbd>C-j</kbd>
to evaluate the expression before point and insert its value in the
buffer.  See <a href="#Lisp-Interaction">Lisp Interaction</a>.

     <br><dt>Lisp mode<dd>The mode for editing source files of programs that run in Lisps other
than Emacs Lisp.  It defines <kbd>C-M-x</kbd> to evaluate the current
top-level expression in an external Lisp.  See <a href="#External-Lisp">External Lisp</a>.

     <br><dt>Inferior Lisp mode<dd>The mode for an interactive session with an external Lisp which is
being run as a subprocess (or <dfn>inferior process</dfn>) of Emacs.

<h3 class="section">27.8 Libraries of Lisp Code for Emacs</h3>

<p><a name="index-libraries-2926"></a><a name="index-loading-Lisp-code-2927"></a>
  Emacs Lisp code is stored in files whose names conventionally end in
<samp><span class="file">.el</span></samp>.  Such files are automatically visited in Emacs Lisp mode.

   <p><a name="index-byte-code-2928"></a>  Emacs Lisp code can be compiled into byte-code, which loads faster,
takes up less space, and executes faster.  By convention, compiled
Emacs Lisp code goes in a separate file whose name ends in
`<samp><span class="samp">.elc</span></samp>'.  For example, the compiled code for <samp><span class="file">foo.el</span></samp> goes in
<samp><span class="file">foo.elc</span></samp>.  See <a href="elisp.html#Byte-Compilation">Byte Compilation</a>.

   <p><a name="index-load_002dfile-2929"></a>  To <dfn>load</dfn> an Emacs Lisp file, type <kbd>M-x load-file</kbd>.  This
command reads a file name using the minibuffer, and executes the
contents of that file as Emacs Lisp code.  It is not necessary to
visit the file first; this command reads the file directly from disk,
not from an existing Emacs buffer.

   <p><a name="index-load-2930"></a><a name="index-load_002dlibrary-2931"></a><a name="index-load_002dprefer_002dnewer-2932"></a><a name="index-load-path-for-Emacs-Lisp-2933"></a>  If an Emacs Lisp file is installed in the Emacs Lisp <dfn>load path</dfn>
(defined below), you can load it by typing <kbd>M-x load-library</kbd>,
instead of using <kbd>M-x load-file</kbd>.  The <kbd>M-x load-library</kbd>
command prompts for a <dfn>library name</dfn> rather than a file name; it
searches through each directory in the Emacs Lisp load path, trying to
find a file matching that library name.  If the library name is
`<samp><var>foo</var></samp>', it tries looking for files named
<samp><var>foo</var><span class="file">.elc</span></samp>, <samp><var>foo</var><span class="file">.el</span></samp>, and <samp><var>foo</var></samp>.  The
default behavior is to load the first file found.  This command
prefers <samp><span class="file">.elc</span></samp> files over <samp><span class="file">.el</span></samp> files because compiled files
load and run faster.  If it finds that <samp><var>lib</var><span class="file">.el</span></samp> is newer
than <samp><var>lib</var><span class="file">.elc</span></samp>, it issues a warning, in case someone made
changes to the <samp><span class="file">.el</span></samp> file and forgot to recompile it, but loads
the <samp><span class="file">.elc</span></samp> file anyway.  (Due to this behavior, you can save
unfinished edits to Emacs Lisp source files, and not recompile until
your changes are ready for use.)  If you set the option
<code>load-prefer-newer</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> value, however, then
rather than the procedure described above, Emacs loads whichever
version of the file is newest.

   <p>Emacs Lisp programs usually load Emacs Lisp files using the
<code>load</code> function.  This is similar to <code>load-library</code>, but is
lower-level and accepts additional arguments.  See <a href="elisp.html#How-Programs-Do-Loading">How Programs Do Loading</a>.

   <p><a name="index-load_002dpath-2934"></a>  The Emacs Lisp load path is specified by the variable
<code>load-path</code>.  Its value should be a list of directory names
(strings).  These directories are searched, in the specified order, by
the <kbd>M-x load-library</kbd> command, the lower-level <code>load</code>
function, and other Emacs functions that find Emacs Lisp libraries.  A
list entry in <code>load-path</code> can also have the special value
<code>nil</code>, which stands for the current default directory, but it is
almost always a bad idea to use this.  (If you find yourself wishing
that <code>nil</code> were in the list, most likely what you really want is
to use <kbd>M-x load-file</kbd>.)

   <p>The default value of <code>load-path</code> is a list of directories where
the Lisp code for Emacs itself is stored.  If you have libraries of
your own in another directory, you can add that directory to the load
path.  Unlike most other variables described in this manual,
<code>load-path</code> cannot be changed via the Customize interface
(see <a href="#Easy-Customization">Easy Customization</a>), but you can add a directory to it by
putting a line like this in your init file (see <a href="#Init-File">Init File</a>):

<pre class="example">     (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/my/lisp/library")
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-autoload-2935"></a>  Some commands are <dfn>autoloaded</dfn>; when you run them, Emacs
automatically loads the associated library first.  For instance, the
<kbd>M-x compile</kbd> command (see <a href="#Compilation">Compilation</a>) is autoloaded; if you
call it, Emacs automatically loads the <code>compile</code> library first. 
In contrast, the command <kbd>M-x recompile</kbd> is not autoloaded, so it
is unavailable until you load the <code>compile</code> library.

   <p><a name="index-help_002denable_002dauto_002dload-2936"></a>  Automatic loading can also occur when you look up the documentation
of an autoloaded command (see <a href="#Name-Help">Name Help</a>), if the documentation
refers to other functions and variables in its library (loading the
library lets Emacs properly set up the hyperlinks in the <samp><span class="file">*Help*</span></samp>
buffer).  To disable this feature, change the variable
<code>help-enable-auto-load</code> to <code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-load_002ddangerous_002dlibraries-2937"></a><a name="index-Lisp-files-byte_002dcompiled-by-XEmacs-2938"></a>  By default, Emacs refuses to load compiled Lisp files which were
compiled with XEmacs, a modified versions of Emacs&mdash;they can cause
Emacs to crash.  Set the variable <code>load-dangerous-libraries</code> to
<code>t</code> if you want to try loading them.

<h3 class="section">27.9 Evaluating Emacs Lisp Expressions</h3>

<p><a name="index-Emacs-Lisp-mode-2939"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Emacs-Lisp-2940"></a><a name="index-evaluation_002c-Emacs-Lisp-2941"></a>
<a name="index-emacs_002dlisp_002dmode-2942"></a>  Emacs Lisp mode is the major mode for editing Emacs Lisp.  Its mode
command is <kbd>M-x emacs-lisp-mode</kbd>.

   <p>Emacs provides several commands for evaluating Emacs Lisp
expressions.  You can use these commands in Emacs Lisp mode, to test
your Emacs Lisp code as it is being written.  For example, after
re-writing a function, you can evaluate the function definition to
make it take effect for subsequent function calls.  These commands are
also available globally, and can be used outside Emacs Lisp mode.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-:</kbd><dd>Read a single Emacs Lisp expression in the minibuffer, evaluate it,
and print the value in the echo area (<code>eval-expression</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x C-e</kbd><dd>Evaluate the Emacs Lisp expression before point, and print the value
in the echo area (<code>eval-last-sexp</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-M-x</kbd> <span class="roman">(in Emacs Lisp mode)</span><dt><kbd>M-x eval-defun</kbd><dd>Evaluate the defun containing or after point, and print the value in
the echo area (<code>eval-defun</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x eval-region</kbd><dd>Evaluate all the Emacs Lisp expressions in the region. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x eval-buffer</kbd><dd>Evaluate all the Emacs Lisp expressions in the buffer. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-M_002d_003a-2943"></a><a name="index-eval_002dexpression-2944"></a>  <kbd>M-:</kbd> (<code>eval-expression</code>) reads an expression using the
minibuffer, and evaluates it.  (Before evaluating the expression, the
current buffer switches back to the buffer that was current when you
typed <kbd>M-:</kbd>, not the minibuffer into which you typed the
expression.)

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002de-2945"></a><a name="index-eval_002dlast_002dsexp-2946"></a>  The command <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd> (<code>eval-last-sexp</code>) evaluates the
Emacs Lisp expression preceding point in the buffer, and displays the
value in the echo area.  When the result of an evaluation is an
integer, it is displayed together with the value in other formats
(octal, hexadecimal, and character).

   <p>If <kbd>M-:</kbd> or <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd> is given a prefix argument, it inserts
the value into the current buffer at point, rather than displaying it
in the echo area.  If the prefix argument is zero, any integer output
is inserted together with its value in other formats (octal,
hexadecimal, and character).  Such a prefix argument also prevents
abbreviation of the output according to the variables
<code>eval-expression-print-level</code> and <code>eval-expression-print-length</code>
(see below).

   <p><a name="index-C_002dM_002dx-_0040r_007b_0028Emacs-Lisp-mode_0029_007d-2947"></a><a name="index-eval_002ddefun-2948"></a>  The <code>eval-defun</code> command is bound to <kbd>C-M-x</kbd> in Emacs Lisp
mode.  It evaluates the top-level Lisp expression containing or
following point, and prints the value in the echo area.  In this
context, a top-level expression is referred to as a &ldquo;defun&rdquo;, but it
need not be an actual <code>defun</code> (function definition).  In
particular, this command treats <code>defvar</code> expressions specially. 
Normally, evaluating a <code>defvar</code> expression does nothing if the
variable it defines already has a value.  But this command
unconditionally resets the variable to the initial value specified by
the <code>defvar</code>; this is convenient for debugging Emacs Lisp
programs.  <code>defcustom</code> and <code>defface</code> expressions are treated
similarly.  Note that the other commands documented in this section do
not have this special feature.

   <p>With a prefix argument, <kbd>C-M-x</kbd> instruments the function
definition for Edebug, the Emacs Lisp Debugger.  See <a href="elisp.html#Instrumenting">Instrumenting for Edebug</a>.

   <p><a name="index-eval_002dregion-2949"></a><a name="index-eval_002dbuffer-2950"></a>  The command <kbd>M-x eval-region</kbd> parses the text of the region as
one or more Lisp expressions, evaluating them one by one.  <kbd>M-x
eval-buffer</kbd> is similar but evaluates the entire buffer.

   <p><a name="index-eval_002dexpression_002dprint_002dlevel-2951"></a><a name="index-eval_002dexpression_002dprint_002dlength-2952"></a><a name="index-eval_002dexpression_002ddebug_002don_002derror-2953"></a>  The options <code>eval-expression-print-level</code> and
<code>eval-expression-print-length</code> control the maximum depth and
length of lists to print in the result of the evaluation commands
before abbreviating them.  Supplying a zero prefix argument to
<code>eval-expression</code> or <code>eval-last-sexp</code> causes lists to be
printed in full.  <code>eval-expression-debug-on-error</code> controls
whether evaluation errors invoke the debugger when these commands are
used; its default is <code>t</code>.

<h3 class="section">27.10 Lisp Interaction Buffers</h3>

<p><a name="index-lisp_002dinteraction_002dmode-2954"></a>  When Emacs starts up, it contains a buffer named <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp>,
which is provided for evaluating Emacs Lisp expressions interactively. 
Its major mode is Lisp Interaction mode.  You can also enable Lisp
Interaction mode by typing <kbd>M-x lisp-interaction-mode</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-eval_002dprint_002dlast_002dsexp-2955"></a><a name="index-C_002dj-_0040r_007b_0028Lisp-Interaction-mode_0029_007d-2956"></a>  In the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer, and other Lisp Interaction mode
buffers, <kbd>C-j</kbd> (<code>eval-print-last-sexp</code>) evaluates the Lisp
expression before point, and inserts the value at point.  Thus, as you
type expressions into the buffer followed by <kbd>C-j</kbd> after each
expression, the buffer records a transcript of the evaluated
expressions and their values.  All other commands in Lisp Interaction
mode are the same as in Emacs Lisp mode.

   <p><a name="index-initial_002dscratch_002dmessage-2957"></a>  At startup, the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer contains a short message, in
the form of a Lisp comment, that explains what it is for.  This
message is controlled by the variable <code>initial-scratch-message</code>,
which should be either a documentation string, or <code>nil</code> (which means to
suppress the message).

   <p><a name="index-ielm-2958"></a>  An alternative way of evaluating Emacs Lisp expressions
interactively is to use Inferior Emacs Lisp mode, which provides an
interface rather like Shell mode (see <a href="#Shell-Mode">Shell Mode</a>) for evaluating
Emacs Lisp expressions.  Type <kbd>M-x ielm</kbd> to create an
<samp><span class="file">*ielm*</span></samp> buffer which uses this mode.  For more information, see
that command's documentation.

<h3 class="section">27.11 Running an External Lisp</h3>

<p><a name="index-Lisp-mode-2959"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Lisp-2960"></a><a name="index-Common-Lisp-2961"></a>
  Lisp mode is the major mode for editing programs written in
general-purpose Lisp dialects, such as Common Lisp.  Its mode command
is <kbd>M-x lisp-mode</kbd>.  Emacs uses Lisp mode automatically for files
whose names end in <samp><span class="file">.l</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">.lsp</span></samp>, or <samp><span class="file">.lisp</span></samp>.

   <p><a name="index-run_002dlisp-2962"></a><a name="index-inferior_002dlisp_002dprogram-2963"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dz-2964"></a>  You can run an external Lisp session as a subprocess or
<dfn>inferior process</dfn> of Emacs, and pass expressions to it to be
evaluated.  To begin an external Lisp session, type <kbd>M-x
run-lisp</kbd>.  This runs the program named <samp><span class="command">lisp</span></samp>, and sets it up
so that both input and output go through an Emacs buffer named
<samp><span class="file">*inferior-lisp*</span></samp>.  To change the name of the Lisp program run by
<kbd>M-x run-lisp</kbd>, change the variable <code>inferior-lisp-program</code>.

   <p>The major mode for the <samp><span class="file">*lisp*</span></samp> buffer is Inferior Lisp mode,
which combines the characteristics of Lisp mode and Shell mode
(see <a href="#Shell-Mode">Shell Mode</a>).  To send input to the Lisp session, go to the
end of the <samp><span class="file">*lisp*</span></samp> buffer and type the input, followed by
&lt;RET&gt;.  Terminal output from the Lisp session is automatically
inserted in the buffer.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dM_002dx-_0040r_007b_0028Lisp-mode_0029_007d-2965"></a><a name="index-lisp_002deval_002ddefun-2966"></a>  When you edit a Lisp program in Lisp mode, you can type <kbd>C-M-x</kbd>
(<code>lisp-eval-defun</code>) to send an expression from the Lisp mode
buffer to a Lisp session that you had started with <kbd>M-x run-lisp</kbd>. 
The expression sent is the top-level Lisp expression at or following
point.  The resulting value goes as usual into the
<samp><span class="file">*inferior-lisp*</span></samp> buffer.  Note that the effect of <kbd>C-M-x</kbd> in
Lisp mode is thus very similar to its effect in Emacs Lisp mode
(see <a href="#Lisp-Eval">Lisp Eval</a>), except that the expression is sent to a different
Lisp environment instead of being evaluated in Emacs.

   <p><a name="index-scheme_002dmode-2967"></a><a name="index-run_002dscheme-2968"></a><a name="index-Scheme-mode-2969"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Scheme-2970"></a><a name="index-C_002dM_002dx-_0040r_007b_0028Scheme-mode_0029_007d-2971"></a>  The facilities for editing Scheme code, and for sending expressions
to a Scheme subprocess, are very similar.  Scheme source files are
edited in Scheme mode, which can be explicitly enabled with <kbd>M-x
scheme-mode</kbd>.  You can initiate a Scheme session by typing <kbd>M-x
run-scheme</kbd> (the buffer for interacting with Scheme is named
<samp><span class="file">*scheme*</span></samp>), and send expressions to it by typing <kbd>C-M-x</kbd>.

     <ul>
<li>Unified interface to Support for Version Control Systems
(<acronym>VCS</acronym>) that record the history of changes to source files.

     <li>A specialized mode for maintaining <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> files that provide

<h3 class="section">28.1 Version Control</h3>

<p><a name="index-version-control-2972"></a>
  A <dfn>version control system</dfn> is a program that can record multiple
versions of a source file, storing information such as the creation
time of each version, who made it, and a description of what was
changed.

   <p>The Emacs version control interface is called <dfn>VC</dfn>.  VC
commands work with several different version control systems;
currently, it supports Bazaar, CVS, Git, Mercurial, Monotone, RCS,
SCCS/CSSC, and Subversion.  Of these, the GNU project distributes CVS,
RCS, and Bazaar.

   <p>VC is enabled automatically whenever you visit a file governed by a
version control system.  To disable VC entirely, set the customizable
variable <code>vc-handled-backends</code> to <code>nil</code>
(see <a href="#Customizing-VC">Customizing VC</a>).

   <p><a name="index-vc_002drefresh_002dstate-2973"></a><a name="index-vc_002dstate_002drefresh-2974"></a>  To update the VC state information for the file visited in the
current buffer, use the command <code>vc-refresh-state</code>.  This command
is useful when you perform version control commands outside Emacs
(e.g., from the shell prompt), or if you put the buffer's file under a
different version control system, or remove it from version control
entirely.  A companion command <code>vc-state-refresh</code> does the same,
but does not consider switching the version control system or removal
from VC.

<h4 class="subsection">28.1.1 Introduction to Version Control</h4>

<p>VC allows you to use a version control system from within Emacs,
integrating the version control operations smoothly with editing.  It
provides a uniform interface for common operations in many version
control operations.

   <p>Some uncommon or intricate version control operations, such as
altering repository settings, are not supported in VC.  You should
perform such tasks outside Emacs, e.g., via the command line.

   <p>This section provides a general overview of version control, and
describes the version control systems that VC supports.  You can skip
this section if you are already familiar with the version control system
you want to use.

<h5 class="subsubsection">28.1.1.1 Understanding the problems it addresses</h5>

<p>Version control systems provide you with three important
capabilities:

     <ul>
<li><dfn>Reversibility</dfn>: the ability to back up to a previous state if you
discover that some modification you did was a mistake or a bad idea.

     <li><dfn>Concurrency</dfn>: the ability to have many people modifying the same
collection of files knowing that conflicting modifications can be
detected and resolved.

     <li><dfn>History</dfn>: the ability to attach historical data to your data,
such as explanatory comments about the intention behind each change to
it.  Even for a programmer working solo, change histories are an
important aid to memory; for a multi-person project, they are a
vitally important form of communication among developers.

<h5 class="subsubsection">28.1.1.2 Supported Version Control Systems</h5>

<p><a name="index-back-end-_0028version-control_0029-2975"></a>  VC currently works with many different version control systems,
which it refers to as <dfn>back ends</dfn>:

     
<a name="index-SCCS-2976"></a>
<ul><li>SCCS was the first version control system ever built, and was long ago
superseded by more advanced ones.  VC compensates for certain features
missing in SCCS (e.g., tag names for releases) by implementing them
itself.  Other VC features, such as multiple branches, are simply
unavailable.  Since SCCS is non-free, we recommend avoiding it.

     <p><a name="index-CSSC-2977"></a><li>CSSC is a free replacement for SCCS.  You should use CSSC only if, for
some reason, you cannot use a more recent and better-designed version
control system.

     <p><a name="index-RCS-2978"></a><li>RCS is the free version control system around which VC was initially
built.  It is relatively primitive: it cannot be used over the
network, and works at the level of individual files.  Almost
everything you can do with RCS can be done through VC.

     <p><a name="index-CVS-2979"></a><li>CVS is the free version control system that was, until recently (circa
2008), used by the majority of free software projects.  Nowadays, it
is slowly being superseded by newer systems.  CVS allows concurrent
multi-user development either locally or over the network.  Unlike
newer systems, it lacks support for atomic commits and file
moving/renaming.  VC supports all basic editing operations under CVS.

     <p><a name="index-SVN-2980"></a><a name="index-Subversion-2981"></a><li>Subversion (svn) is a free version control system designed to be
similar to CVS but without its problems (e.g., it supports atomic
commits of filesets, and versioning of directories, symbolic links,
meta-data, renames, copies, and deletes).

     <p><a name="index-git-2982"></a><li>Git is a decentralized version control system originally invented by
Linus Torvalds to support development of Linux (his kernel).  VC
supports many common Git operations, but others, such as repository
syncing, must be done from the command line.

     <p><a name="index-hg-2983"></a><a name="index-Mercurial-2984"></a><li>Mercurial (hg) is a decentralized version control system broadly
resembling Git.  VC supports most Mercurial commands, with the
exception of repository sync operations.

     <p><a name="index-bzr-2985"></a><a name="index-Bazaar-2986"></a><li>Bazaar (bzr) is a decentralized version control system that supports
both repository-based and decentralized versioning.  VC supports most
basic editing operations under Bazaar.

     <p><a name="index-SRC-2987"></a><a name="index-src-2988"></a><li>SRC (src) is RCS, reloaded - a specialized version-control system
designed for single-file projects worked on by only one person.  It
allows multiple files with independent version-control histories to
exist in one directory, and is thus particularly well suited for
maintaining small documents, scripts, and dotfiles.  While it uses RCS
for revision storage, it presents a modern user interface featuring
lockless operation and integer sequential version numbers.  VC
supports almost all SRC operations.

<h5 class="subsubsection">28.1.1.3 Concepts of Version Control</h5>

<p><a name="index-repository-2989"></a><a name="index-registered-file-2990"></a>   When a file is under version control, we say that it is
<dfn>registered</dfn> in the version control system.  The system has a
<dfn>repository</dfn> which stores both the file's present state and its
change history&mdash;enough to reconstruct the current version or any
earlier version.  The repository also contains other information, such
as <dfn>log entries</dfn> that describe the changes made to each file.

   <p><a name="index-work-file-2991"></a><a name="index-checking-out-files-2992"></a>  The copy of a version-controlled file that you actually edit is
called the <dfn>work file</dfn>.  You can change each work file as you
would an ordinary file.  After you are done with a set of changes, you
may <dfn>commit</dfn> (or <dfn>check in</dfn>) the changes; this records the
changes in the repository, along with a descriptive log entry.

   <p><a name="index-working-tree-2993"></a>  A directory tree of work files is called a <dfn>working tree</dfn>.

   <p><a name="index-revision-2994"></a><a name="index-revision-ID-2995"></a>  Each commit creates a new <dfn>revision</dfn> in the repository.  The
version control system keeps track of all past revisions and the
changes that were made in each revision.  Each revision is named by a
<dfn>revision ID</dfn>, whose format depends on the version control system;
in the simplest case, it is just an integer.

   <p>To go beyond these basic concepts, you will need to understand three
aspects in which version control systems differ.  As explained in the
next three sections, they can be lock-based or merge-based; file-based
or changeset-based; and centralized or decentralized.  VC handles all
these modes of operation, but it cannot hide the differences.

<h5 class="subsubsection">28.1.1.4 Merge-based vs lock-based Version Control</h5>

<p>A version control system typically has some mechanism to coordinate
between users who want to change the same file.  There are two ways to
do this: merging and locking.

   <p><a name="index-merging_002dbased-version-2996"></a>  In a version control system that uses merging, each user may modify
a work file at any time.  The system lets you <dfn>merge</dfn> your work
file, which may contain changes that have not been committed, with the
latest changes that others have committed.

   <p><a name="index-locking_002dbased-version-2997"></a>  Older version control systems use a <dfn>locking</dfn> scheme instead. 
Here, work files are normally read-only.  To edit a file, you ask the
version control system to make it writable for you by <dfn>locking</dfn>
it; only one user can lock a given file at any given time.  This
procedure is analogous to, but different from, the locking that Emacs
uses to detect simultaneous editing of ordinary files
(see <a href="#Interlocking">Interlocking</a>).  When you commit your changes, that unlocks
the file, and the work file becomes read-only again.  Other users may
then lock the file to make their own changes.

   <p>Both locking and merging systems can have problems when multiple
users try to modify the same file at the same time.  Locking systems
have <dfn>lock conflicts</dfn>; a user may try to check a file out and be
unable to because it is locked.  In merging systems, <dfn>merge
conflicts</dfn> happen when you commit a change to a file that conflicts
with a change committed by someone else after your checkout.  Both
kinds of conflict have to be resolved by human judgment and
communication.  Experience has shown that merging is superior to
locking, both in convenience to developers and in minimizing the
number and severity of conflicts that actually occur.

   <p>SCCS always uses locking.  RCS is lock-based by default but can be
told to operate in a merging style.  CVS and Subversion are
merge-based by default but can be told to operate in a locking mode. 
Decentralized version control systems, such as Git and Mercurial, are
exclusively merging-based.

   <p>VC mode supports both locking and merging version control.  The
terms &ldquo;commit&rdquo; and &ldquo;update&rdquo; are used in newer version control
systems; older lock-based systems use the terms &ldquo;check in&rdquo; and
&ldquo;check out&rdquo;.  VC hides the differences between them as much as
possible.

<h5 class="subsubsection">28.1.1.5 Changeset-based vs File-based Version Control</h5>

<p><a name="index-file_002dbased-version-control-2998"></a>  On SCCS, RCS, CVS, and other early version control systems, version
control operations are <dfn>file-based</dfn>: each file has its own comment
and revision history separate from that of all other files.  Newer
systems, beginning with Subversion, are <dfn>changeset-based</dfn>: a
commit may include changes to several files, and the entire set of
changes is handled as a unit.  Any comment associated with the change
does not belong to a single file, but to the changeset itself.

   <p><a name="index-changeset_002dbased-version-control-2999"></a>  Changeset-based version control is more flexible and powerful than
file-based version control; usually, when a change to multiple files
has to be reversed, it's good to be able to easily identify and remove
all of it.

<h5 class="subsubsection">28.1.1.6 Decentralized vs Centralized Repositories</h5>

<p><a name="index-centralized-version-control-3000"></a><a name="index-decentralized-version-control-3001"></a><a name="index-distributed-version-control-3002"></a>  Early version control systems were designed around a
<dfn>centralized</dfn> model in which each project has only one repository
used by all developers.  SCCS, RCS, CVS, and Subversion share this
kind of model.  One of its drawbacks is that the repository is a choke
point for reliability and efficiency.

   <p>GNU Arch pioneered the concept of <dfn>distributed</dfn> or
<dfn>decentralized</dfn> version control, later implemented in Git,
Mercurial, and Bazaar.  A project may have several different
repositories, and these systems support a sort of super-merge between
repositories that tries to reconcile their change histories.  In
effect, there is one repository for each developer, and repository
merges take the place of commit operations.

   <p>VC helps you manage the traffic between your personal workfiles and
a repository.  Whether the repository is a single master, or one of a
network of peer repositories, is not something VC has to care about.

<h5 class="subsubsection">28.1.1.7 Types of Log File</h5>

<p><a name="index-types-of-log-file-3003"></a><a name="index-log-File_002c-types-of-3004"></a><a name="index-version-control-log-3005"></a>
  Projects that use a version control system can have two types of log
for changes.  One is the log maintained by the version control system:
each time you commit a change, you fill out a <dfn>log entry</dfn> for the
change (see <a href="#Log-Buffer">Log Buffer</a>).  This is called the <dfn>version control
log</dfn>.

   <p>The other kind of log is the file <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> (see <a href="#Change-Log">Change Log</a>).  It provides a chronological record of all changes to a large
portion of a program&mdash;typically one directory and its subdirectories. 
A small program would use one <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> file; a large program
may have a <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> file in each major directory. 
See <a href="#Change-Log">Change Log</a>.  Programmers have used change logs since long
before version control systems.

   <p>Changeset-based version systems typically maintain a changeset-based
modification log for the entire system, which makes change log files
somewhat redundant.  One advantage that they retain is that it is
sometimes useful to be able to view the transaction history of a
single directory separately from those of other directories.  Another
advantage is that commit logs can't be fixed in many version control
systems.

   <p>A project maintained with version control can use just the version
control log, or it can use both kinds of logs.  It can handle some
files one way and some files the other way.  Each project has its
policy, which you should follow.

   <p>When the policy is to use both, you typically want to write an entry
for each change just once, then put it into both logs.  You can write
the entry in <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp>, then copy it to the log buffer with
<kbd>C-c C-a</kbd> when committing the change (see <a href="#Log-Buffer">Log Buffer</a>).  Or you
can write the entry in the log buffer while committing the change, and
later use the <kbd>C-x v a</kbd> command to copy it to <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp>
(see <a href="#Change-Logs-and-VC">Change Logs and VC</a>).

<h4 class="subsection">28.1.2 Version Control and the Mode Line</h4>

<p><a name="index-VC-mode-line-indicator-3006"></a>
  When you visit a file that is under version control, Emacs indicates
this on the mode line.  For example, `<samp><span class="samp">Bzr-1223</span></samp>' says that Bazaar
is used for that file, and the current revision ID is 1223.

   <p><a name="index-version-control-status-3007"></a>  The character between the back-end name and the revision ID
indicates the <dfn>version control status</dfn> of the work file.  In a
merge-based version control system, a `<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>' character indicates
that the work file is unmodified, and `<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>' indicates that it has
been modified.  `<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>' indicates that the file contains conflicts as
result of a recent merge operation (see <a href="#Merging">Merging</a>), or that the file
was removed from the version control.  Finally, `<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>' means that
the file is under version control, but is missing from the working
tree.

   <p>In a lock-based system, `<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>' indicates an unlocked file, and
`<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>' a locked file; if the file is locked by another user (for
instance, `<samp><span class="samp">jim</span></samp>'), that is displayed as `<samp><span class="samp">RCS:jim:1.3</span></samp>'. 
`<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>' means that the file was locally added, but not yet committed
to the master repository.

   <p>On a graphical display, you can move the mouse over this mode line
indicator to pop up a tool-tip, which displays a more verbose
description of the version control status.  Pressing <kbd>mouse-1</kbd>
over the indicator pops up a menu of VC commands, identical to
`<samp><span class="samp">Tools / Version Control</span></samp>' on the menu bar.

   <p><a name="index-auto_002drevert_002dcheck_002dvc_002dinfo-3008"></a>  When Auto Revert mode (see <a href="#Reverting">Reverting</a>) reverts a buffer that is
under version control, it updates the version control information in
the mode line.  However, Auto Revert mode may not properly update this
information if the version control status changes without changes to
the work file, from outside the current Emacs session.  If you set
<code>auto-revert-check-vc-info</code> to <code>t</code>, Auto Revert mode updates
the version control status information every
<code>auto-revert-interval</code> seconds, even if the work file itself is
unchanged.  The resulting CPU usage depends on the version control
system, but is usually not excessive.

<p><a name="index-filesets_002c-VC-3009"></a><a name="index-VC-filesets-3010"></a>   Most VC commands operate on <dfn>VC filesets</dfn>.  A VC fileset is a
collection of one or more files that a VC operation acts on.  When you
type VC commands in a buffer visiting a version-controlled file, the
VC fileset is simply that one file.  When you type them in a VC
Directory buffer, and some files in it are marked, the VC fileset
consists of the marked files (see <a href="#VC-Directory-Mode">VC Directory Mode</a>).

   <p>On modern changeset-based version control systems (see <a href="#VCS-Changesets">VCS Changesets</a>), VC commands handle multi-file VC filesets as a group. 
For example, committing a multi-file VC fileset generates a single
revision, containing the changes to all those files.  On older
file-based version control systems like CVS, each file in a multi-file
VC fileset is handled individually; for example, a commit generates
one revision for each changed file.

</dl>

   <p><a name="index-vc_002dnext_002daction-3011"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-v-v-3012"></a>  The principal VC command is a multi-purpose command, <kbd>C-x v v</kbd>
(<code>vc-next-action</code>), which performs the most appropriate
action on the current VC fileset: either registering it with a version
control system, or committing it, or unlocking it, or merging changes
into it.  The precise actions are described in detail in the following
subsections.  You can use <kbd>C-x v v</kbd> either in a file-visiting
buffer or in a VC Directory buffer.

   <p>Note that VC filesets are distinct from the named filesets used
for viewing and visiting files in functional groups
(see <a href="#Filesets">Filesets</a>).  Unlike named filesets, VC filesets are not named
and don't persist across sessions.

<h5 class="subsubsection">28.1.3.1 Basic Version Control with Merging</h5>

<p>On a merging-based version control system (i.e., most modern ones;
see <a href="#VCS-Merging">VCS Merging</a>), <kbd>C-x v v</kbd> does the following:

     <ul>
<li>If there is more than one file in the VC fileset and the files have
inconsistent version control statuses, signal an error.  (Note,
however, that a fileset is allowed to include both newly-added
files and modified files; see <a href="#Registering">Registering</a>.)

     <li>If none of the files in the VC fileset are registered with a version
control system, register the VC fileset, i.e., place it under version
control.  See <a href="#Registering">Registering</a>.  If Emacs cannot find a system to
register under, it prompts for a repository type, creates a new
repository, and registers the VC fileset with it.

     <li>If every work file in the VC fileset is unchanged, do nothing.

     <li>If every work file in the VC fileset has been modified, commit the
changes.  To do this, Emacs pops up a <samp><span class="file">*vc-log*</span></samp> buffer; type the
desired log entry for the new revision, followed by <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> to
commit.  See <a href="#Log-Buffer">Log Buffer</a>.

     <p>If committing to a shared repository, the commit may fail if the
repository that has been changed since your last update.  In that
case, you must perform an update before trying again.  On a
decentralized version control system, use <kbd>C-x v +</kbd>
(see <a href="#Pulling-_002f-Pushing">Pulling / Pushing</a>) or <kbd>C-x v m</kbd> (see <a href="#Merging">Merging</a>). 
On a centralized version control system, type <kbd>C-x v v</kbd> again to
merge in the repository changes.

     <li>Finally, if you are using a centralized version control system, check
if each work file in the VC fileset is up-to-date.  If any file has
been changed in the repository, offer to update it. 
</ul>

   <p>These rules also apply when you use RCS in its non-locking mode,
except that changes are not automatically merged from the repository. 
Nothing informs you if another user has committed changes in the same
file since you began editing it; when you commit your revision, his
changes are removed (however, they remain in the repository and are
thus not irrevocably lost).  Therefore, you must verify that the
current revision is unchanged before committing your changes.  In
addition, locking is possible with RCS even in this mode: <kbd>C-x v
v</kbd> with an unmodified file locks the file, just as it does with RCS in
its normal locking mode (see <a href="#VC-With-A-Locking-VCS">VC With A Locking VCS</a>).

<h5 class="subsubsection">28.1.3.2 Basic Version Control with Locking</h5>

<p>On a locking-based version control system (such as SCCS, and RCS in
its default mode), <kbd>C-x v v</kbd> does the following:

     <ul>
<li>If there is more than one file in the VC fileset and the files have
inconsistent version control statuses, signal an error.

     <li>If each file in the VC fileset is not registered with a version
control system, register the VC fileset.  See <a href="#Registering">Registering</a>.  If
Emacs cannot find a system to register under, it prompts for a
repository type, creates a new repository, and registers the VC
fileset with it.

     <li>If each file is registered and unlocked, lock it and make it writable,
so that you can begin to edit it.

     <li>If each file is locked by you and contains changes, commit the
changes.  To do this, Emacs pops up a <samp><span class="file">*vc-log*</span></samp> buffer; type the
desired log entry for the new revision, followed by <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> to
commit (see <a href="#Log-Buffer">Log Buffer</a>).

     <li>If each file is locked by you, but you have not changed it, release
the lock and make the file read-only again.

     <li>If each file is locked by another user, ask whether you want to
steal the lock.  If you say yes, the file becomes locked by you,
and a warning message is sent to the user who had formerly locked the
file. 
</ul>

   <p>These rules also apply when you use CVS in locking mode, except
that CVS does not support stealing locks.

<p><a name="index-revision-ID-in-version-control-3013"></a>  When you give a prefix argument to <code>vc-next-action</code> (<kbd>C-u
C-x v v</kbd>), it still performs the next logical version control
operation, but accepts additional arguments to specify precisely how
to do the operation.

     <ul>
<li><a name="index-specific-version-control-system-3014"></a>You can specify the name of a version control system.  This is useful
if the fileset can be managed by more than one version control system,
and Emacs fails to detect the correct one.

     <li>Otherwise, if using CVS or RCS, you can specify a revision ID.

     <p>If the fileset is modified (or locked), this makes Emacs commit with
that revision ID.  You can create a new branch by supplying an
appropriate revision ID (see <a href="#Branches">Branches</a>).

     <p>If the fileset is unmodified (and unlocked), this checks the specified
revision into the working tree.  You can also specify a revision on
another branch by giving its revision or branch ID (see <a href="#Switching-Branches">Switching Branches</a>).  An empty argument (i.e., <kbd>C-u C-x v v &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>)
checks out the latest (head) revision on the current branch.

     <p>This is silently ignored on a decentralized version control system. 
Those systems do not let you specify your own revision IDs, nor do
they use the concept of checking out individual files.

(see <a href="#Hooks">Hooks</a>).

   <p>In the <samp><span class="file">*vc-log*</span></samp> buffer, you can write one or more <dfn>header
lines</dfn>, specifying additional information to be supplied to the
version control system.  Each header line must occupy a single line at
the top of the buffer; the first line that is not a header line is
treated as the start of the log entry.  For example, the following
header line states that the present change was not written by you, but
by another developer:

<pre class="smallexample">     Author: J. R. Hacker &lt;jrh@example.com&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Apart from the `<samp><span class="samp">Author</span></samp>' header, Emacs recognizes the headers
`<samp><span class="samp">Date</span></samp>' (a manually-specified commit time) and `<samp><span class="samp">Fixes</span></samp>' (a
reference to a bug fixed by the change).  Not all version control
systems recognize all headers: Bazaar recognizes all three headers,
while Git, Mercurial, and Monotone recognize only `<samp><span class="samp">Author</span></samp>' and
`<samp><span class="samp">Date</span></samp>'.  If you specify a header for a system that does not
support it, the header is treated as part of the log entry.

considered to be the fileset that will be committed if you type
<kbd>C-c&nbsp;C-c</kbd><!-- /@w -->.  To view a list of the files in the VC fileset,
type <kbd>C-c&nbsp;C-f</kbd><!-- /@w --> (<code>log-edit-show-files</code>).  To view a diff
of changes between the VC fileset and the version from which you
started editing (see <a href="#Old-Revisions">Old Revisions</a>), type <kbd>C-c C-d</kbd>
(<code>log-edit-show-diff</code>).

(see <a href="#Change-Log">Change Log</a>), type <kbd>C-c C-a</kbd>
(<code>log-edit-insert-changelog</code>) to pull the relevant entries into
the <samp><span class="file">*vc-log*</span></samp> buffer.  If the topmost item in each
<samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> was made under your user name on the current date,
this command searches that item for entries matching the file(s) to be
committed, and inserts them. 
If you are using CVS or RCS, see <a href="#Change-Logs-and-VC">Change Logs and VC</a>, for the
opposite way of working&mdash;generating ChangeLog entries from the Log

   <p>To abort a commit, just <em>don't</em> type <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> in that
buffer.  You can switch buffers and do other editing.  As long as you
don't try to make another commit, the entry you were editing remains
in the <samp><span class="file">*vc-log*</span></samp> buffer, and you can go back to that buffer at
any time to complete the commit.

a commit comment.  This can be useful when you want to make several
commits with similar comments.  The commands <kbd>M-n</kbd>, <kbd>M-p</kbd>,
<kbd>M-s</kbd> and <kbd>M-r</kbd> for doing this work just like the minibuffer

<dt><kbd>C-x v i</kbd><dd>Register the visited file for version control. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-v-i-3030"></a><a name="index-vc_002dregister-3031"></a>  The command <kbd>C-x v i</kbd> (<code>vc-register</code>) <dfn>registers</dfn> each
file in the current VC fileset, placing it under version control. 
This is essentially equivalent to the action of <kbd>C-x v v</kbd> on an
unregistered VC fileset (see <a href="#Basic-VC-Editing">Basic VC Editing</a>), except that if the
VC fileset is already registered, <kbd>C-x v i</kbd> signals an error
whereas <kbd>C-x v v</kbd> performs some other action.

   <p>To register a file, Emacs must choose a version control system.  For
a multi-file VC fileset, the VC Directory buffer specifies the system
to use (see <a href="#VC-Directory-Mode">VC Directory Mode</a>).  For a single-file VC fileset, if
the file's directory already contains files registered in a version
control system, or if the directory is part of a directory tree
controlled by a version control system, Emacs chooses that system.  In
the event that more than one version control system is applicable,
Emacs uses the one that appears first in the variable
<code>vc-handled-backends</code> (see <a href="#Customizing-VC">Customizing VC</a>). 
If Emacs cannot find a version control system to register the file
under, it prompts for a repository type, creates a new repository, and
registers the file into that repository.

   <p>On most version control systems, registering a file with <kbd>C-x v
i</kbd> or <kbd>C-x v v</kbd> adds it to the working tree but not to the
repository.  Such files are labeled as `<samp><span class="samp">added</span></samp>' in the VC
Directory buffer, and show a revision ID of `<samp><span class="samp">@@</span></samp>' in the mode
line.  To make the registration take effect in the repository, you
must perform a commit (see <a href="#Basic-VC-Editing">Basic VC Editing</a>).  Note that a single
commit can include both file additions and edits to existing files.

   <p>On a locking-based version control system (see <a href="#VCS-Merging">VCS Merging</a>),
registering a file leaves it unlocked and read-only.  Type <kbd>C-x v
v</kbd> to start editing it.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-x v g</kbd><dd>Display an annotated version of the current file: for each line, show
the latest revision in which it was modified (<code>vc-annotate</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-vc_002ddiff-3032"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-v-_003d-3033"></a>  <kbd>C-x v =</kbd> (<code>vc-diff</code>) displays a <dfn>diff</dfn> which compares
each work file in the current VC fileset to the version(s) from which
you started editing.  The diff is displayed in another window, in a
Diff mode buffer (see <a href="#Diff-Mode">Diff Mode</a>) named <samp><span class="file">*vc-diff*</span></samp>.  The
usual Diff mode commands are available in this buffer.  In particular,
the <kbd>g</kbd> (<code>revert-buffer</code>) command performs the file
comparison again, generating a new diff.

   <p><a name="index-C_002du-C_002dx-v-_003d-3034"></a>  To compare two arbitrary revisions of the current VC fileset, call
<code>vc-diff</code> with a prefix argument: <kbd>C-u C-x v =</kbd>.  This
prompts for two revision IDs (see <a href="#VCS-Concepts">VCS Concepts</a>), and displays a
diff between those versions of the fileset.  This will not work
reliably for multi-file VC filesets, if the version control system is
file-based rather than changeset-based (e.g., CVS), since then
revision IDs for different files would not be related in any
meaningful way.

   <p>Instead of the revision ID, some version control systems let you
specify revisions in other formats.  For instance, under Bazaar you
can enter `<samp><span class="samp">date:yesterday</span></samp>' for the argument to <kbd>C-u C-x v =</kbd>
(and related commands) to specify the first revision committed after
yesterday.  See the documentation of the version control system for
details.

   <p>If you invoke <kbd>C-x v =</kbd> or <kbd>C-u C-x v =</kbd> from a Dired buffer
(see <a href="#Dired">Dired</a>), the file listed on the current line is treated as the
current VC fileset.

   <p><a name="index-vc_002dediff-3035"></a>  <kbd>M-x vc-ediff</kbd> works like <kbd>C-x v =</kbd>, except that it uses an
Ediff session.  See <a href="ediff.html#Top">Ediff</a>.

   <p><a name="index-vc_002droot_002ddiff-3036"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-v-D-3037"></a>  <kbd>C-x v D</kbd> (<code>vc-root-diff</code>) is similar to <kbd>C-x v =</kbd>, but
it displays the changes in the entire current working tree (i.e., the
working tree containing the current VC fileset).  If you invoke this
command from a Dired buffer, it applies to the working tree containing
the directory.

   <p><a name="index-vc_002ddiff_002dswitches-3038"></a>  You can customize the <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp> options that <kbd>C-x v =</kbd> and
<kbd>C-x v D</kbd> use for generating diffs.  The options used are taken
from the first non-<code>nil</code> value amongst the variables
<code>vc-</code><var>backend</var><code>-diff-switches</code>, <code>vc-diff-switches</code>, and
<code>diff-switches</code> (see <a href="#Comparing-Files">Comparing Files</a>), in that order.  Here,
<var>backend</var> stands for the relevant version control system,
e.g., <code>bzr</code> for Bazaar.  Since <code>nil</code> means to check the
next variable in the sequence, either of the first two may use the
value <code>t</code> to mean no switches at all.  Most of the
<code>vc-</code><var>backend</var><code>-diff-switches</code> variables default to <code>nil</code>,
but some default to <code>t</code>; these are for version control systems
whose <code>diff</code> implementations do not accept common diff options,
such as Subversion.

   <p><a name="index-vc_002drevision_002dother_002dwindow-3039"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-v-_007e-3040"></a>  To directly examine an older version of a file, visit the work file
and type <kbd>C-x v ~ </kbd><var>revision</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
(<code>vc-revision-other-window</code>).  This retrieves the file version
corresponding to <var>revision</var>, saves it to
<samp><var>filename</var><span class="file">.~</span><var>revision</var><span class="file">~</span></samp>, and visits it in a separate
window.

   <p><a name="index-vc_002dannotate-3041"></a><a name="index-vc_002dannotate_002dbackground_002dmode-3042"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-v-g-3043"></a>  Many version control systems allow you to view files <dfn>annotated</dfn>
with per-line revision information, by typing <kbd>C-x v g</kbd>
(<code>vc-annotate</code>).  This creates a new &ldquo;annotate&rdquo; buffer
displaying the file's text, with each line colored to show how old it
is.  Red text is new, blue is old, and intermediate colors indicate
intermediate ages.  By default, the color is scaled over the full
range of ages, such that the oldest changes are blue, and the newest
changes are red.  If the variable <code>vc-annotate-background-mode</code>
is non-<code>nil</code>, the colors expressing the age of each line are
applied to the background color, leaving the foreground at its default
color.

   <p>When you give a prefix argument to this command, Emacs reads two
arguments using the minibuffer: the revision to display and annotate
(instead of the current file contents), and the time span in days the
color range should cover.

   <p>From the &ldquo;annotate&rdquo; buffer, these and other color scaling options are
available from the `<samp><span class="samp">VC-Annotate</span></samp>' menu.  In this buffer, you can
also use the following keys to browse the annotations of past revisions,
view diffs, or view log entries:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>p</kbd><dd>Annotate the previous revision, i.e., the revision before the one
currently annotated.  A numeric prefix argument is a repeat count, so
<kbd>C-u 10 p</kbd> would take you back 10 revisions.

     <br><dt><kbd>n</kbd><dd>Annotate the next revision, i.e., the revision after the one
currently annotated.  A numeric prefix argument is a repeat count.

     <br><dt><kbd>j</kbd><dd>Annotate the revision indicated by the current line.

     <br><dt><kbd>a</kbd><dd>Annotate the revision before the one indicated by the current line. 
This is useful to see the state the file was in before the change on
the current line was made.

     <br><dt><kbd>f</kbd><dd>Show in a buffer the file revision indicated by the current line.

     <br><dt><kbd>d</kbd><dd>Display the diff between the current line's revision and the previous
revision.  This is useful to see what the current line's revision
actually changed in the file.

     <br><dt><kbd>D</kbd><dd>Display the diff between the current line's revision and the previous
revision for all files in the changeset (for VC systems that support
changesets).  This is useful to see what the current line's revision
actually changed in the tree.

     <br><dt><kbd>l</kbd><dd>Show the log of the current line's revision.  This is useful to see
the author's description of the changes in the revision on the current
line.

     <br><dt><kbd>w</kbd><dd>Annotate the working revision&ndash;the one you are editing.  If you used
<kbd>p</kbd> and <kbd>n</kbd> to browse to other revisions, use this key to
return to your working revision.

     <br><dt><kbd>v</kbd><dd>Toggle the annotation visibility.  This is useful for looking just at

centered at the revision of the file currently being visited.  With a
prefix argument, the command prompts for the revision to center on,
and the maximum number of revisions to display.

   <p>If you call <kbd>C-x v l</kbd> from a VC Directory buffer (see <a href="#VC-Directory-Mode">VC Directory Mode</a>) or a Dired buffer (see <a href="#Dired">Dired</a>), it applies to the

version-controlled directory tree (RCS, SCCS, and CVS do not support
this feature).  With a prefix argument, the command prompts for the
maximum number of revisions to display.

   <p>The <kbd>C-x v L</kbd> history is shown in a compact form, usually
showing only the first line of each log entry.  However, you can type
&lt;RET&gt; (<code>log-view-toggle-entry-display</code>) in the
<samp><span class="file">*vc-change-log*</span></samp> buffer to reveal the entire log entry for the

   <p>On a decentralized version control system, the <kbd>C-x v I</kbd>
(<code>vc-log-incoming</code>) command displays a log buffer showing the
changes that will be applied, the next time you run the version
control system's pull command to get new revisions from another
repository (see <a href="#Pulling-_002f-Pushing">Pulling / Pushing</a>).  This other repository is the default
one from which changes are pulled, as defined by the version control
system; with a prefix argument, <code>vc-log-incoming</code> prompts for a
specific repository.  Similarly, <kbd>C-x v O</kbd>
(<code>vc-log-outgoing</code>) shows the changes that will be sent to
another repository, the next time you run the push command; with a
prefix argument, it prompts for a specific destination repository.

   <p>In the <samp><span class="file">*vc-change-log*</span></samp> buffer, you can use the following keys
to move between the logs of revisions and of files, and to examine and
compare past revisions (see <a href="#Old-Revisions">Old Revisions</a>):

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>p</kbd><dd>Move to the previous revision entry.  (Revision entries in the log
buffer are usually in reverse-chronological order, so the previous
revision-item usually corresponds to a newer revision.)  A numeric
prefix argument is a repeat count.

     <br><dt><kbd>n</kbd><dd>Move to the next revision entry.  A numeric prefix argument is a
repeat count.

     <br><dt><kbd>P</kbd><dd>Move to the log of the previous file, if showing logs for a multi-file

numeric prefix argument is a repeat count.

     <br><dt><kbd>N</kbd><dd>Move to the log of the next file, if showing logs for a multi-file VC

called with a prefix argument, you can remove a file from the ignored
file list.

<h4 class="subsection">28.1.10 VC Directory Mode</h4>

<p><a name="index-VC-Directory-buffer-3055"></a>  The <dfn>VC Directory buffer</dfn> is a specialized buffer for viewing
the version control statuses of the files in a directory tree, and
performing version control operations on those files.  In particular,
it is used to specify multi-file VC filesets for commands like
<kbd>C-x&nbsp;v&nbsp;v</kbd><!-- /@w --> to act on (see <a href="#VC-Directory-Commands">VC Directory Commands</a>).

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-v-d-3056"></a><a name="index-vc_002ddir-3057"></a>  To use the VC Directory buffer, type <kbd>C-x v d</kbd> (<code>vc-dir</code>). 
This reads a directory name using the minibuffer, and switches to a VC
Directory buffer for that directory.  By default, the buffer is named
<samp><span class="file">*vc-dir*</span></samp>.  Its contents are described
in <a href="#VC-Directory-Buffer">VC Directory Buffer</a>.

   <p>The <code>vc-dir</code> command automatically detects the version control
system to be used in the specified directory.  In the event that more
than one system is being used in the directory, you should invoke the
command with a prefix argument, <kbd>C-u C-x v d</kbd>; this prompts for
the version control system which the VC Directory buffer should use.

   <p><a name="index-PCL_002dCVS-3058"></a><a name="index-cvs-3059"></a><a name="index-CVS-directory-mode-3060"></a>  In addition to the VC Directory buffer, Emacs has a similar facility
called PCL-CVS which is specialized for CVS.  See <a href="pcl-cvs.html#Top">About PCL-CVS</a>.

<h5 class="subsubsection">28.1.10.1 The VC Directory Buffer</h5>

<p>The VC Directory buffer contains a list of version-controlled files
and their version control statuses.  It lists files in the current
directory (the one specified when you called <kbd>C-x v d</kbd>) and its
subdirectories, but only those with a noteworthy status.  Files
that are up-to-date (i.e., the same as in the repository) are
omitted.  If all the files in a subdirectory are up-to-date, the
subdirectory is not listed either.  As an exception, if a file has
become up-to-date as a direct result of a VC command, it is listed.

   <p>Here is an example of a VC Directory buffer listing:

<pre class="smallexample">                          ./
         edited           configure.ac
     *   added            README
         unregistered     temp.txt
                          src/
     *   edited           src/main.c
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Two work files have been modified but not committed:
<samp><span class="file">configure.ac</span></samp> in the current directory, and <samp><span class="file">foo.c</span></samp> in the
<samp><span class="file">src/</span></samp> subdirectory.  The file named <samp><span class="file">README</span></samp> has been added
but is not yet committed, while <samp><span class="file">temp.txt</span></samp> is not under version
control (see <a href="#Registering">Registering</a>).

   <p>The `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' characters next to the entries for <samp><span class="file">README</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">src/main.c</span></samp> indicate that the user has marked out these files as
the current VC fileset
(see <a href="#VC-Directory-Commands">VC Directory Commands</a>).

   <p>The above example is typical for a decentralized version control
system like Bazaar, Git, or Mercurial.  Other systems can show other
statuses.  For instance, CVS shows the `<samp><span class="samp">needs-update</span></samp>' status if
the repository has changes that have not been applied to the work
file.  RCS and SCCS show the name of the user locking a file as its
status.

   <p><a name="index-vc_002dstay_002dlocal-3061"></a><a name="index-vc_002dcvs_002dstay_002dlocal-3062"></a>  On CVS and Subversion, the <code>vc-dir</code> command normally contacts
the repository, which may be on a remote machine, to check for
updates.  If you change the variable <code>vc-stay-local</code> or
<code>vc-cvs-stay-local</code> (for CVS) to <code>nil</code> (see <a href="#CVS-Options">CVS Options</a>), then Emacs avoids contacting a remote repository when
generating the VC Directory buffer (it will still contact it when
necessary, e.g., when doing a commit).  This may be desirable if you
are working offline or the network is slow.

   <p><a name="index-vc_002ddirectory_002dexclusion_002dlist-3063"></a>  The VC Directory buffer omits subdirectories listed in the variable
<code>vc-directory-exclusion-list</code>.  Its default value contains
directories that are used internally by version control systems.

<h5 class="subsubsection">28.1.10.2 VC Directory Commands</h5>

<p>Emacs provides several commands for navigating the VC Directory
buffer, and for marking files as belonging to the current VC
fileset.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>n</kbd><dt><kbd>&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd><dd>Move point to the next entry (<code>vc-dir-next-line</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>p</kbd><dd>Move point to the previous entry (<code>vc-dir-previous-line</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd><dd>Move to the next directory entry (<code>vc-dir-next-directory</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>S-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd><dd>Move to the previous directory entry
(<code>vc-dir-previous-directory</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>&lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dt><kbd>f</kbd><dd>Visit the file or directory listed on the current line
(<code>vc-dir-find-file</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>o</kbd><dd>Visit the file or directory on the current line, in a separate window
(<code>vc-dir-find-file-other-window</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>m</kbd><dd>Mark the file or directory on the current line (<code>vc-dir-mark</code>),
putting it in the current VC fileset.  If the region is active, mark
all files in the region.

     <p>A file cannot be marked with this command if it is already in a marked
directory, or one of its subdirectories.  Similarly, a directory
cannot be marked with this command if any file in its tree is marked.

     <br><dt><kbd>M</kbd><dd>If point is on a file entry, mark all files with the same status; if
point is on a directory entry, mark all files in that directory tree
(<code>vc-dir-mark-all-files</code>).  With a prefix argument, mark all
listed files and directories.

     <br><dt><kbd>q</kbd><dd>Quit the VC Directory buffer, and bury it (<code>quit-window</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>u</kbd><dd>Unmark the file or directory on the current line.  If the region is
active, unmark all the files in the region (<code>vc-dir-unmark</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>U</kbd><dd>If point is on a file entry, unmark all files with the same status; if
point is on a directory entry, unmark all files in that directory tree
(<code>vc-dir-unmark-all-files</code>).  With a prefix argument, unmark all
files and directories.

     <br><dt><kbd>x</kbd><dd>Hide files with `<samp><span class="samp">up-to-date</span></samp>' status
(<code>vc-dir-hide-up-to-date</code>).  With a prefix argument, hide items
whose state is that of the item at point. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-vc_002ddir_002dmark-3064"></a><a name="index-vc_002ddir_002dmark_002dall_002dfiles-3065"></a>  While in the VC Directory buffer, all the files that you mark with
<kbd>m</kbd> (<code>vc-dir-mark</code>) or <kbd>M</kbd> (<code>vc-dir-mark-all-files</code>)
are in the current VC fileset.  If you mark a directory entry with
<kbd>m</kbd>, all the listed files in that directory tree are in the
current VC fileset.  The files and directories that belong to the
current VC fileset are indicated with a `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' character in the VC
Directory buffer, next to their VC status.  In this way, you can set
up a multi-file VC fileset to be acted on by VC commands like
<kbd>C-x&nbsp;v&nbsp;v</kbd><!-- /@w --> (see <a href="#Basic-VC-Editing">Basic VC Editing</a>), <kbd>C-x&nbsp;v&nbsp;=</kbd><!-- /@w -->
(see <a href="#Old-Revisions">Old Revisions</a>), and <kbd>C-x&nbsp;v&nbsp;u</kbd><!-- /@w --> (see <a href="#VC-Undo">VC Undo</a>).

   <p>The VC Directory buffer also defines some single-key shortcuts for
VC commands with the <kbd>C-x v</kbd> prefix: <kbd>=</kbd>, <kbd>+</kbd>, <kbd>l</kbd>,
<kbd>i</kbd>, <kbd>D</kbd>, <kbd>L</kbd>, <kbd>G</kbd>, <kbd>I</kbd> and <kbd>v</kbd>.

   <p>For example, you can commit a set of edited files by opening a VC
Directory buffer, where the files are listed with the `<samp><span class="samp">edited</span></samp>'
status; marking the files; and typing <kbd>v</kbd> or <kbd>C-x v v</kbd>
(<code>vc-next-action</code>).  If the version control system is
changeset-based, Emacs will commit the files in a single revision.

   <p>While in the VC Directory buffer, you can also perform search and
replace on the current VC fileset, with the following commands:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>S</kbd><dd>Search the fileset (<code>vc-dir-search</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>Q</kbd><dd>Do a regular expression query replace on the fileset
(<code>vc-dir-query-replace-regexp</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>M-s a C-s</kbd><dd>Do an incremental search on the fileset (<code>vc-dir-isearch</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>M-s a C-M-s</kbd><dd>Do an incremental regular expression search on the fileset
(<code>vc-dir-isearch-regexp</code>). 
</dl>

<p class="noindent">Apart from acting on multiple files, these commands behave much like
their single-buffer counterparts (see <a href="#Search">Search</a>).

   <p><a name="index-stashes-in-version-control-3066"></a><a name="index-shelves-in-version-control-3067"></a>  The above commands are also available via the menu bar, and via a
context menu invoked by <kbd>mouse-2</kbd>.  Furthermore, some VC backends
use the menu to provide extra backend-specific commands.  For example,
Git and Bazaar allow you to manipulate <dfn>stashes</dfn> and <dfn>shelves</dfn>
(where are a way to temporarily put aside uncommitted changes, and
bring them back at a later time).

  One use of version control is to support multiple independent lines
of development, which are called <dfn>branches</dfn>.  Amongst other
things, branches can be used for maintaining separate stable and
development versions of a program, and for developing unrelated
features in isolation from one another.

   <p>VC's support for branch operations is currently fairly limited.  For
decentralized version control systems, it provides commands for
<dfn>updating</dfn> one branch with the contents of another, and for
<dfn>merging</dfn> the changes made to two different branches
(see <a href="#Merging">Merging</a>).  For centralized version control systems, it
supports checking out different branches and committing into new or
different branches.

<h5 class="subsubsection">28.1.11.1 Switching between Branches</h5>

<p>The various version control systems differ in how branches are
implemented, and these differences cannot be entirely concealed by VC.

   <p>On some decentralized version control systems, including Bazaar and
Mercurial in its normal mode of operation, each branch has its own
working directory tree, so switching between branches just involves
switching directories.  On Git, branches are normally <dfn>co-located</dfn>
in the same directory, and switching between branches is done using
the <samp><span class="command">git checkout</span></samp> command, which changes the contents of the
working tree to match the branch you switch to.  Bazaar also supports
co-located branches, in which case the <samp><span class="command">bzr switch</span></samp> command
will switch branches in the current directory.  With Subversion, you
switch to another branch using the <samp><span class="command">svn switch</span></samp> command.

   <p>The VC command to switch to another branch in the current directory
is <kbd>C-x v r </kbd><var>branch-name</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> (<code>vc-retrieve-tag</code>).

   <p>On centralized version control systems, you can also switch between
branches by typing <kbd>C-u C-x v v</kbd> in an up-to-date work file
(see <a href="#Advanced-C_002dx-v-v">Advanced C-x v v</a>), and entering the revision ID for a
revision on another branch.  On CVS, for instance, revisions on the
<dfn>trunk</dfn> (the main line of development) normally have IDs of the
form 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, <small class="dots">...</small>, while the first branch created from (say)
revision 1.2 has revision IDs 1.2.1.1, 1.2.1.2, <small class="dots">...</small>, the second
branch created from revision 1.2 has revision IDs 1.2.2.1, 1.2.2.2,
<small class="dots">...</small>, and so forth.  You can also specify the <dfn>branch ID</dfn>,
which is a branch revision ID omitting its final component
(e.g., 1.2.1), to switch to the latest revision on that branch.

   <p>On a locking-based system, switching to a different branch also
unlocks (write-protects) the working tree.

   <p>Once you have switched to a branch, VC commands will apply to that
branch until you switch away; for instance, any VC filesets that you
commit will be committed to that specific branch.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-v-P-3069"></a><a name="index-vc_002dpush-3070"></a>On a decentralized version control system, the command <kbd>C-x v P</kbd>
(<code>vc-push</code>) updates another location with changes from the
current branch.  With a prefix argument, it prompts for the exact
version control command to run, which lets you specify where to push
changes; the default is <samp><span class="command">bzr push</span></samp> with Bazaar, <samp><span class="command">git
push</span></samp> with Git, and <samp><span class="command">hg push</span></samp> with Mercurial.  The default
commands always push to a default location determined by the version
control system from your branch configuration.

   <p>Prior to pushing, you can use <kbd>C-x v O</kbd> (<code>vc-log-outgoing</code>)
to view a log buffer of the changes to be sent.  See <a href="#VC-Change-Log">VC Change Log</a>.

   <p><a name="index-bound-branch-_0028Bazaar-VCS_0029-3071"></a>This command is currently supported only by Bazaar, Git, and Mercurial. 
The concept of &ldquo;pushing&rdquo; does not exist for centralized version
control systems, where this operation is a part of committing a
changeset, so invoking this command on a centralized VCS signals an
error.  This command also signals an error when attempted in a Bazaar
<dfn>bound branch</dfn>, where committing a changeset automatically pushes
the changes to the remote repository to which the local branch is
bound.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-v-_002b-3072"></a><a name="index-vc_002dpull-3073"></a>  On a decentralized version control system, the command <kbd>C-x v +</kbd>
(<code>vc-pull</code>) updates the current branch and working tree.  It is
typically used to update a copy of a remote branch.  If you supply a
prefix argument, the command prompts for the exact version control
command to use, which lets you specify where to pull changes from. 
Otherwise, it pulls from a default location determined by the version
control system.

   <p>Amongst decentralized version control systems, <kbd>C-x v +</kbd> is
currently supported only by Bazaar, Git, and Mercurial.  With Bazaar,
it calls <samp><span class="command">bzr pull</span></samp> for ordinary branches (to pull from a
master branch into a mirroring branch), and <samp><span class="command">bzr update</span></samp> for a
bound branch (to pull from a central repository).  With Git, it calls
<samp><span class="command">git pull</span></samp> to fetch changes from a remote repository and merge
it into the current branch.  With Mercurial, it calls <samp><span class="command">hg pull
-u</span></samp> to fetch changesets from the default remote repository and update
the working directory.

   <p>Prior to pulling, you can use <kbd>C-x v I</kbd> (<code>vc-log-incoming</code>)
to view a log buffer of the changes to be applied.  See <a href="#VC-Change-Log">VC Change Log</a>.

   <p>On a centralized version control system like CVS, <kbd>C-x v +</kbd>
updates the current VC fileset from the repository.

     <p>On a centralized version control system, merge changes from another
branch into the current VC fileset. 
</dl>

   <p>While developing a branch, you may sometimes need to <dfn>merge</dfn> in
changes that have already been made in another branch.  This is not a
trivial operation, as overlapping changes may have been made to the
two branches.

   <p>On a decentralized version control system, merging is done with the
command <kbd>C-x v m</kbd> (<code>vc-merge</code>).  On Bazaar, this prompts for
the exact arguments to pass to <samp><span class="command">bzr merge</span></samp>, offering a
sensible default if possible.  On Git, this prompts for the name of a
branch to merge from, with completion (based on the branch names known
to the current repository).  The output from running the merge command
is shown in a separate buffer.

   <p>On a centralized version control system like CVS, <kbd>C-x v m</kbd>
prompts for a branch ID, or a pair of revision IDs (see <a href="#Switching-Branches">Switching Branches</a>); then it finds the changes from that branch, or the changes
between the two revisions you specified, and merges those changes into
the current VC fileset.  If you just type &lt;RET&gt;, Emacs simply
merges any changes that were made on the same branch since you checked
the file out.

   <p><a name="index-conflicts-3075"></a><a name="index-resolving-conflicts-3076"></a>  Immediately after performing a merge, only the working tree is
modified, and you can review the changes produced by the merge with
<kbd>C-x v D</kbd> and related commands (see <a href="#Old-Revisions">Old Revisions</a>).  If the
two branches contained overlapping changes, merging produces a
<dfn>conflict</dfn>; a warning appears in the output of the merge command,
and <dfn>conflict markers</dfn> are inserted into each affected work file,
surrounding the two sets of conflicting changes.  You must then
resolve the conflict by editing the conflicted files.  Once you are
done, the modified files must be committed in the usual way for the
merge to take effect (see <a href="#Basic-VC-Editing">Basic VC Editing</a>).

<h5 class="subsubsection">28.1.11.4 Creating New Branches</h5>

<p>On centralized version control systems like CVS, Emacs supports
creating new branches as part of a commit operation.  When committing
a modified VC fileset, type <kbd>C-u C-x v v</kbd> (<code>vc-next-action</code>
with a prefix argument; see <a href="#Advanced-C_002dx-v-v">Advanced C-x v v</a>).  Then Emacs prompts
for a revision ID for the new revision.  You should specify a suitable
branch ID for a branch starting at the current revision.  For example,
if the current revision is 2.5, the branch ID should be 2.5.1, 2.5.2,
and so on, depending on the number of existing branches at that point.

   <p>To create a new branch at an older revision (one that is no longer
the head of a branch), first select that revision (see <a href="#Switching-Branches">Switching Branches</a>).  Your procedure will then differ depending on whether you
are using a locking or merging-based VCS.

   <p>On a locking VCS, you will need to lock the old revision branch with
<kbd>C-x v v</kbd>.  You'll be asked to confirm, when you lock the old
revision, that you really mean to create a new branch&mdash;if you say no,
you'll be offered a chance to lock the latest revision instead.  On a
merging-based VCS you will skip this step.

   <p>Then make your changes and type <kbd>C-x v v</kbd> again to commit a new
revision.  This creates a new branch starting from the selected
revision.

   <p>After the branch is created, subsequent commits create new revisions
on that branch.  To leave the branch, you must explicitly select a
different revision with <kbd>C-u C-x v v</kbd>.

<h5 class="subsubsection">28.1.12.1 Change Logs and VC</h5>

<p>If you use RCS or CVS for a program with a <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> file
(see <a href="#Change-Log">Change Log</a>),
you can generate change log entries from the version control log
entries of previous commits.

   <p>Note that this only works with RCS or CVS.  This procedure would be
particularly incorrect on a modern changeset-based version control
system, where changes to the <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> file would normally be
committed as part of a changeset.  In that case, you should write the
change log entries first, then pull them into the `<samp><span class="samp">*vc-log*</span></samp>'
buffer when you commit
(see <a href="#Log-Buffer">Log Buffer</a>).

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x v a</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dx-v-a-3077"></a><a name="index-vc_002dupdate_002dchange_002dlog-3078"></a>Visit the current directory's <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> file and, for
registered files in that directory, create new entries for versions
committed since the most recent change log entry
(<code>vc-update-change-log</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-u C-x v a</kbd><dd>As above, but only find entries for the current buffer's file. 
</dl>

   <p>For example, suppose the first line of <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> is dated
1999-04-10, and that the only check-in since then was by Nathaniel
Bowditch to <samp><span class="file">rcs2log</span></samp> on 1999-05-22 with log entry `<samp><span class="samp">Ignore
log messages that start with '#'.</span></samp>'.  Then <kbd>C-x v a</kbd> inserts this
<samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> entry:

<pre class="smallexample">     1999-05-22  Nathaniel Bowditch  &lt;nat@apn.org&gt;
     
             * rcs2log: Ignore log messages that start with '#'.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If the version control log entry specifies a function name (in
parenthesis at the beginning of a line), that is reflected in the
<samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> entry.  For example, if a log entry for <samp><span class="file">vc.el</span></samp>
is `<samp><span class="samp">(vc-do-command): Check call-process status.</span></samp>', the
<samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> entry is:

<pre class="smallexample">     1999-05-06  Nathaniel Bowditch  &lt;nat@apn.org&gt;
     
             * vc.el (vc-do-command): Check call-process status.
</pre>
   <p>When <kbd>C-x v a</kbd> adds several change log entries at once, it
groups related log entries together if they all are checked in by the
same author at nearly the same time.  If the log entries for several
such files all have the same text, it coalesces them into a single
entry.

it via the version control system.  The file is removed from the

(see <a href="#VC-Directory-Mode">VC Directory Mode</a>),
it is displayed with the `<samp><span class="samp">removed</span></samp>' status.  When you commit it,

This prompts for two arguments: the name of the file you wish to
rename, and the new name; then it performs the renaming via the
version control system.  The renaming takes effect immediately in the
working tree, and takes effect in the repository when you commit the
renamed file.

   <p>On modern version control systems that have built-in support for
renaming, the renamed file retains the full change history of the
original file.  On CVS and older version control systems, the
<code>vc-rename-file</code> command actually works by creating a copy of the
old file under the new name, registering it, and deleting the old
file.  In this case, the change history is not preserved.

<h5 class="subsubsection">28.1.12.3 Revision Tags</h5>

<p><a name="index-revision-tag-3082"></a><a name="index-tags-for-version-control-3083"></a>
  Most version control systems allow you to apply a <dfn>revision tag</dfn>
to a specific version of a version-controlled tree.  On modern
changeset-based version control systems, a revision tag is simply a
symbolic name for a particular revision.  On older file-based systems
like CVS, each tag is added to the entire set of version-controlled
files, allowing them to be handled as a unit.  Revision tags are
commonly used to identify releases that are distributed to users.

   <p>There are two basic commands for tags; one makes a tag with a given
name, the other retrieves a named tag.

     
<a name="index-C_002dx-v-s-3084"></a>
<a name="index-vc_002dcreate_002dtag-3085"></a>
<dl><dt><code>C-x v s </code><var>name</var><code> &lt;RET&gt;</code><dd>Define the working revision of every registered file in or under the
current directory as a tag named <var>name</var>
(<code>vc-create-tag</code>).

     <p><a name="index-C_002dx-v-r-3086"></a><a name="index-vc_002dretrieve_002dtag-3087"></a><br><dt><code>C-x v r </code><var>name</var><code> &lt;RET&gt;</code><dd>For all registered files at or below the current directory level,
retrieve the tagged revision <var>name</var>. This command will switch to a
branch if <var>name</var> is a branch name and your VCS distinguishes
branches from tags.  (<code>vc-retrieve-tag</code>).

     <p>This command reports an error if any files are locked at or below the
current directory, without changing anything; this is to avoid
overwriting work in progress. 
</dl>

   <p>You can give a tag or branch name as an argument to <kbd>C-x v =</kbd> or
<kbd>C-x v ~</kbd>
(see <a href="#Old-Revisions">Old Revisions</a>). 
Thus, you can use it to compare a tagged version against the current files,
or two tagged versions against each other.

   <p>On SCCS, VC implements tags itself; these tags are visible only
through VC.  Most later systems (including CVS, Subversion, bzr, git,
and hg) have a native tag facility, and VC uses it where available;
those tags will be visible even when you bypass VC.

   <p>In file-based version control systems, when you rename a registered
file you need to rename its master along with it; the command
<code>vc-rename-file</code> will do this automatically
(see <a href="#VC-Delete_002fRename">VC Delete/Rename</a>). 
If you are using SCCS, you must also update the records of the tag, to
mention the file by its new name (<code>vc-rename-file</code> does this,
too).  An old tag that refers to a master file that no longer exists
under the recorded name is invalid; VC can no longer retrieve it.  It
would be beyond the scope of this manual to explain enough about RCS
and SCCS to explain how to update the tags by hand.  Using
<code>vc-rename-file</code> makes the tag remain valid for retrieval, but it
does not solve all problems.  For example, some of the files in your
program probably refer to others by name.  At the very least, the
makefile probably mentions the file that you renamed.  If you retrieve
an old tag, the renamed file is retrieved under its new name, which is
not the name that the makefile expects.  So the program won't really
work as retrieved.

<h5 class="subsubsection">28.1.12.4 Inserting Version Control Headers</h5>

<p>On Subversion, CVS, RCS, and SCCS, you can put certain special
strings called <dfn>version headers</dfn> into a work file.  When the file
is committed, the version control system automatically puts the
revision number, the name of the user who made the commit, and other
relevant information into the version header.

   <p><a name="index-vc_002dconsult_002dheaders-3088"></a>  VC does not normally use the information in the version headers.  As
an exception, when using RCS, Emacs uses the version header, if there
is one, to determine the file version, since it is often more reliable
than the RCS master file.  To inhibit using the version header this
way, change the variable <code>vc-consult-headers</code> to <code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-v-h-3089"></a><a name="index-vc_002dinsert_002dheaders-3090"></a><a name="index-vc_002d_0040var_007bbackend_007d_002dheader-3091"></a>  To insert a suitable header string into the current buffer, type
<kbd>C-x v h</kbd> (<code>vc-insert-headers</code>).  This command works only on
Subversion, CVS, RCS, and SCCS.  The variable
<code>vc-</code><var>backend</var><code>-header</code> contains the list of keywords to insert
into the version header; for instance, CVS uses <code>vc-cvs-header</code>,
whose default value is <code>'("\$Id\$")</code>.  (The extra backslashes
prevent the string constant from being interpreted as a header, if the
Emacs Lisp file defining it is maintained with version control.)  The
<kbd>C-x v h</kbd> command inserts each keyword in the list on a new line
at point, surrounded by tabs, and inside comment delimiters if
necessary.

   <p><a name="index-vc_002dstatic_002dheader_002dalist-3092"></a>  The variable <code>vc-static-header-alist</code> specifies further strings
to add based on the name of the buffer.  Its value should be a list of
elements of the form <code>(</code><var>regexp</var><code> . </code><var>format</var><code>)</code>.  Whenever
<var>regexp</var> matches the buffer name, <var>format</var> is also inserted as
part of the version header.  A `<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>' in <var>format</var> is replaced
with the file's version control type.

<h4 class="subsection">28.1.13 Customizing VC</h4>

<p><a name="index-vc_002dhandled_002dbackends-3093"></a>  The variable <code>vc-handled-backends</code> determines which version

SVN SCCS Bzr Git Hg Mtn Arch)</code>, so it contains all the version systems
that are currently supported.  If you want VC to ignore one or more of
these systems, exclude its name from the list.  To disable VC
entirely, set this variable to <code>nil</code>.

   <p>The order of systems in the list is significant: when you visit a
file registered in more than one system, VC uses the system that comes
first in <code>vc-handled-backends</code> by default.  The order is also
significant when you register a file for the first time
(see <a href="#Registering">Registering</a>).

<h5 class="subsubsection">28.1.13.1 General Options</h5>

<p><a name="index-vc_002dmake_002dbackup_002dfiles-3094"></a>  Emacs normally does not save backup files for source files that are
maintained with version control.  If you want to make backup files even
for files that use version control, set the variable
<code>vc-make-backup-files</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> value.

   <p><a name="index-vc_002dfollow_002dsymlinks-3095"></a><a name="index-symbolic-links-_0028and-version-control_0029-3096"></a>  Editing a version-controlled file through a symbolic link may cause
unexpected results, if you are unaware that the underlying file is
version-controlled.  The variable <code>vc-follow-symlinks</code> controls
what Emacs does if you try to visit a symbolic link pointing to a
version-controlled file.  If the value is <code>ask</code> (the default),
Emacs asks for confirmation.  If it is <code>nil</code>, Emacs just displays
a warning message.  If it is <code>t</code>, Emacs automatically follows the
link and visits the real file instead.

   <p><a name="index-vc_002dsuppress_002dconfirm-3097"></a>  If <code>vc-suppress-confirm</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, then <kbd>C-x v v</kbd>
and <kbd>C-x v i</kbd> can save the current buffer without asking, and
<kbd>C-x v u</kbd> also operates without asking for confirmation.

   <p><a name="index-vc_002dcommand_002dmessages-3098"></a>  VC mode does much of its work by running the shell commands for the
appropriate version control system.  If <code>vc-command-messages</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>, VC displays messages to indicate which shell commands
it runs, and additional messages when the commands finish.

users, but there is a mode called <dfn>non-strict locking</dfn> in which
you can check-in changes without locking the file first.  Use
`<samp><span class="samp">rcs -U</span></samp>' to switch to non-strict locking for a particular file,
see the <code>rcs</code> manual page for details.

   <p>When deducing the version control state of an RCS file, VC first
looks for an RCS version header string in the file (see <a href="#Version-Headers">Version Headers</a>).  If there is no header string, VC normally looks at the
file permissions of the work file; this is fast.  But there might be
situations when the file permissions cannot be trusted.  In this case
the master file has to be consulted, which is rather expensive.  Also
the master file can only tell you <em>if</em> there's any lock on the
file, but not whether your work file really contains that locked
version.

   <p><a name="index-vc_002dconsult_002dheaders-3101"></a>  You can tell VC not to use version headers to determine the file
status by setting <code>vc-consult-headers</code> to <code>nil</code>.  VC then
always uses the file permissions (if it is supposed to trust them), or
else checks the master file.

   <p><a name="index-vc_002dmistrust_002dpermissions-3102"></a>  You can specify the criterion for whether to trust the file
permissions by setting the variable <code>vc-mistrust-permissions</code>. 
Its value can be <code>t</code> (always mistrust the file permissions and
check the master file), <code>nil</code> (always trust the file
permissions), or a function of one argument which makes the decision. 
The argument is the directory name of the <samp><span class="file">RCS</span></samp> subdirectory.  A
non-<code>nil</code> value from the function says to mistrust the file
permissions.  If you find that the file permissions of work files are
changed erroneously, set <code>vc-mistrust-permissions</code> to <code>t</code>. 
Then VC always checks the master file to determine the file's status.

   <p>VC determines the version control state of files under SCCS much as
with RCS.  It does not consider SCCS version headers, though.  Thus,
the variable <code>vc-mistrust-permissions</code> affects SCCS use, but
<code>vc-consult-headers</code> does not.

<h5 class="subsubsection">28.1.13.3 Options specific for CVS</h5>

<p><a name="index-vc_002dcvs_002dglobal_002dswitches-3103"></a>  You can specify additional command line options to pass to all CVS
operations in the variable <code>vc-cvs-global-switches</code>.  These
switches are inserted immediately after the <code>cvs</code> command, before
the name of the operation to invoke.

   <p><a name="index-vc_002dstay_002dlocal-3104"></a><a name="index-vc_002dcvs_002dstay_002dlocal-3105"></a><a name="index-remote-repositories-_0028CVS_0029-3106"></a>  When using a CVS repository on a remote machine, VC can try keeping
network interactions to a minimum.  This is controlled by the variable
<code>vc-cvs-stay-local</code>.  There is another variable,
<code>vc-stay-local</code>, which enables the feature also for other back
ends that support it, including CVS.  In the following, we will talk
only about <code>vc-cvs-stay-local</code>, but everything applies to
<code>vc-stay-local</code> as well.

   <p>If <code>vc-cvs-stay-local</code> is <code>only-file</code> (the default), VC
determines the version control status of each file using only the
entry in the local CVS subdirectory and the information returned by
previous CVS commands.  As a consequence, if you have modified a file
and somebody else has checked in other changes, you will not be
notified of the conflict until you try to commit.

   <p>If you change <code>vc-cvs-stay-local</code> to <code>nil</code>, VC queries the
remote repository <em>before</em> it decides what to do in
<code>vc-next-action</code> (<kbd>C-x v v</kbd>), just as it does for local
repositories.

   <p>You can also set <code>vc-cvs-stay-local</code> to a regular expression
that is matched against the repository host name; VC then stays local
only for repositories from hosts that match the pattern.

   <p><a name="index-automatic-version-backups-3107"></a>  When using a remote repository, Emacs normally makes <dfn>automatic
version backups</dfn> of the original versions of each edited file.  These
local backups are made whenever you save the first changes to a file,
and they are removed after you commit your changes to the repository. 
(Note that these are not the same as ordinary Emacs backup files;
see <a href="#Backup">Backup</a>.) 
Commands like <kbd>C-x v =</kbd> and <kbd>C-x v u</kbd> make use of automatic
version backups, if possible, to avoid having to access the network.

   <p>Setting <code>vc-cvs-stay-local</code> to <code>nil</code> disables the making
of automatic version backups.

   <p><a name="index-manual-version-backups-3108"></a>  Automatic version backups have names of the form
<var>file</var><code>.~</code><var>version</var><code>.~</code><!-- /@w -->.  This is similar to the name
that <kbd>C-x v ~</kbd> saves old versions to
(see <a href="#Old-Revisions">Old Revisions</a>),
except for the additional dot (`<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>') after the version.  The
relevant VC commands can use both kinds of version backups.  The main
difference is that the manual version backups made by <kbd>C-x v
~</kbd> are not deleted automatically when you commit.

   <p><a name="index-locking-_0028CVS_0029-3109"></a>  CVS does not use locking by default, but there are ways to enable
locking-like behavior using its <samp><span class="env">CVSREAD</span></samp> or <dfn>watch</dfn> feature;
see the CVS documentation for details.  If that case, you can use
<kbd>C-x v v</kbd> in Emacs to toggle locking, as you would for a
locking-based version control system
(see <a href="#VC-With-A-Locking-VCS">VC With A Locking VCS</a>).

<p><a name="index-change-log-3110"></a>  Many software projects keep a <dfn>change log</dfn>.  This is a file,
normally named <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp>, containing a chronological record of
when and how the program was changed.  Sometimes, these files are

file for the file you are editing
(<code>add-change-log-entry-other-window</code>).  If that file is actually
a backup file, it makes an entry appropriate for the file's
parent&mdash;that is useful for making log entries for functions that
have been deleted in the current version.

   <p><kbd>C-x 4 a</kbd> visits the change log file and creates a new entry
unless the most recent entry is for today's date and your name.  It
also creates a new item for the current file.  For many languages, it
can even guess the name of the function or other object that was
changed.

   <p><a name="index-add_002dlog_002dkeep_002dchanges_002dtogether-3113"></a>  When the variable <code>add-log-keep-changes-together</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>, <kbd>C-x 4 a</kbd> adds to any existing item for the file
rather than starting a new item.

   <p>You can combine multiple changes of the same nature.  If you don't
enter any text after the initial <kbd>C-x 4 a</kbd>, any subsequent
<kbd>C-x 4 a</kbd> adds another symbol to the change log entry.

   <p><a name="index-add_002dlog_002dalways_002dstart_002dnew_002drecord-3114"></a>  If <code>add-log-always-start-new-record</code> is non-<code>nil</code>,
<kbd>C-x 4 a</kbd> always makes a new entry, even if the last entry
was made by you and on the same date.

   <p><a name="index-change_002dlog_002dversion_002dinfo_002denabled-3115"></a><a name="index-change_002dlog_002dversion_002dnumber_002dregexp_002dlist-3116"></a><a name="index-file-version-in-change-log-entries-3117"></a>  If the value of the variable <code>change-log-version-info-enabled</code>
is non-<code>nil</code>, <kbd>C-x 4 a</kbd> adds the file's version number to the
change log entry.  It finds the version number by searching the first
ten percent of the file, using regular expressions from the variable
<code>change-log-version-number-regexp-list</code>.

   <p><a name="index-Change-Log-mode-3118"></a><a name="index-change_002dlog_002dmode-3119"></a>  The change log file is visited in Change Log mode.  In this major
mode, each bunch of grouped items counts as one paragraph, and each
entry is considered a page.  This facilitates editing the entries. 
<kbd>C-j</kbd> and auto-fill indent each new line like the previous line;
this is convenient for entering the contents of an entry.

   <p>You can use the <code>next-error</code> command (by default bound to
<kbd>C-x `</kbd>) to move between entries in the Change Log, when Change
Log mode is on.  You will jump to the actual site in the file that was
changed, not just to the next Change Log entry.  You can also use
<code>previous-error</code> to move back in the same list.

   <p><a name="index-change_002dlog_002dmerge-3120"></a>  You can use the command <kbd>M-x change-log-merge</kbd> to merge other
log files into a buffer in Change Log Mode, preserving the date
ordering of entries.

   <p>Version control systems are another way to keep track of changes in
your program and keep a change log.  In the VC log buffer, typing
<kbd>C-c C-a</kbd> (<code>log-edit-insert-changelog</code>) inserts the relevant
Change Log entry, if one exists.  See <a href="#Log-Buffer">Log Buffer</a>.

<h4 class="subsection">28.2.2 Format of ChangeLog</h4>

<p>A change log entry starts with a header line that contains the
current date, your name (taken from the variable
<code>add-log-full-name</code>), and your email address (taken from the
variable <code>add-log-mailing-address</code>).  Aside from these header
lines, every line in the change log starts with a space or a tab.  The
bulk of the entry consists of <dfn>items</dfn>, each of which starts with a
line starting with whitespace and a star.  Here are two entries, both
dated in May 1993, with two items and one item respectively.

<pre class="smallexample">     1993-05-25  Richard Stallman  &lt;rms@gnu.org&gt;
     
             * man.el: Rename symbols 'man-*' to 'Man-*'.
             (manual-entry): Make prompt string clearer.
     
             * simple.el (blink-matching-paren-distance):
             Change default to 12,000.
     
     1993-05-24  Richard Stallman  &lt;rms@gnu.org&gt;
     
             * vc.el (minor-mode-map-alist): Don't use it if it's void.
             (vc-cancel-version): Doc fix.
</pre>
   <p>One entry can describe several changes; each change should have its
own item, or its own line in an item.  Normally there should be a
blank line between items.  When items are related (parts of the same
change, in different places), group them by leaving no blank line
between them.

   <p>You should put a copyright notice and permission notice at the
end of the change log file.  Here is an example:

<pre class="smallexample">     Copyright 1997, 1998 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     Copying and distribution of this file, with or without modification, are
     permitted provided the copyright notice and this notice are preserved.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Of course, you should substitute the proper years and copyright holder.

<h3 class="section">28.3 Find Identifier References</h3>

<p><a name="index-xref-3121"></a>
  An <dfn>identifier</dfn> is a name of a syntactical subunit of the
program: a function, a subroutine, a method, a class, a data type, a
macro, etc.  In a programming language, each identifier is a symbol in
the language's syntax.  Program development and maintenance requires
capabilities to quickly find where each identifier was defined and
referenced, to rename identifiers across the entire project, etc.

   <p>These capabilities are also useful for finding references in major
modes other than those defined to support programming languages.  For
example, chapters, sections, appendices, etc. of a text or a TeX
document can be treated as subunits as well, and their names can be
used as identifiers.  In this chapter, we use the term &ldquo;identifiers&rdquo;
to collectively refer to the names of any kind of subunits, in program
source and in other kinds of text alike.

   <p>Emacs provides a unified interface to these capabilities, called
`<samp><span class="samp">xref</span></samp>'.

   <p><a name="index-xref-backend-3122"></a>To do its job, <code>xref</code> needs to make use of information and to
employ methods specific to the major mode.  What files to search for
identifiers, how to find references to identifiers, how to complete on
identifiers&mdash;all this and more is mode-specific knowledge. 
<code>xref</code> delegates the mode-specific parts of its job to a
<dfn>backend</dfn> provided by the mode; it also includes defaults for some
of its commands, for those modes that don't provide their own.

   <p>A backend can implement its capabilities in a variety of ways.  Here
are a few examples:

     <ol type=a start=1>
<li>Some major modes provide built-in means for looking up the language
symbols.  For example, Emacs Lisp symbols can be identified by
searching the package load history, maintained by the Emacs Lisp
interpreter, and by consulting the built-in documentation strings; the
Emacs Lisp mode uses these facilities in its backend to allow finding
definitions of symbols.  (One disadvantage of this kind of backend is
that it only knows about subunits that were loaded into the
interpreter.)

     <li>An external program can extract references by scanning the relevant
files, and build a database of these references.  A backend can then
access this database whenever it needs to list or look up references. 
The Emacs distribution includes <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp>, a command for tagging
identifier definitions in programs, which supports many programming
languages and other major modes, such as HTML, by extracting
references into <dfn>tags tables</dfn>.  See <a href="#Create-Tags-Table">Create Tags Table</a>.  Major
modes for languages supported by <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp> can use tags tables
as basis for their backend.  (One disadvantage of this kind of backend
is that tags tables need to be kept reasonably up to date, by
rebuilding them from time to time.)

<h4 class="subsection">28.3.1 Find Identifiers</h4>

<p>This subsection describes the commands that find references to
identifiers and perform various queries about identifiers.  Each such
reference could <em>define</em> an identifier, e.g., provide the
implementation of a program subunit or the text of a document section;
or it could <em>use</em> the identifier, e.g., call a function or a
method, assign a value to a variable, mention a chapter in a
cross-reference, etc.

<p><a name="index-find-definition-of-symbols-3123"></a><a name="index-identifier_002c-finding-definition-of-3124"></a><a name="index-find-references-to-symbols-3125"></a>
  The most important thing that <code>xref</code> enables you to do is to find
the definition of a specific identifier.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-.</kbd><dd>Find definitions of an identifier (<code>xref-find-definitions</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-M-. </kbd><var>pattern</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Find all identifiers whose name matches <var>pattern</var>
(<code>xref-find-apropos</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x 4 . &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Find definitions of identifier, but display it in another window
(<code>xref-find-definitions-other-window</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x 5 . &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Find definition of identifier, and display it in a new frame
(<code>xref-find-definitions-other-frame</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-,</kbd><dd>Go back to where you previously invoked <kbd>M-.</kbd> and friends
(<code>xref-pop-marker-stack</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-M_002d_002e-3126"></a><a name="index-xref_002dfind_002ddefinitions-3127"></a>  <kbd>M-.</kbd> (<code>xref-find-definitions</code>) shows the definitions of
the identifier at point.  With a prefix argument, or if there's no
identifier at point, it prompts for the identifier.  If the
identifier has only one definition, the command jumps to it.  If the
identifier has more than one possible definition (e.g., in an
object-oriented language, or if there's a function and a variable by
the same name), the command shows the candidate definitions in a
<samp><span class="file">*xref*</span></samp> buffer, together with the files in which these
definitions are found.  Selecting one of these candidates by typing
<kbd>&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> or clicking <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> will pop a buffer showing
the corresponding definition.

   <p>When entering the identifier argument to <kbd>M-.</kbd>, the usual
minibuffer completion commands can be used (see <a href="#Completion">Completion</a>), with
the known identifier names as completion candidates.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-4-_002e-3128"></a><a name="index-xref_002dfind_002ddefinitions_002dother_002dwindow-3129"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-5-_002e-3130"></a><a name="index-xref_002dfind_002ddefinitions_002dother_002dframe-3131"></a>  Like most commands that can switch buffers,
<code>xref-find-definitions</code> has a variant that displays the new
buffer in another window, and one that makes a new frame for it.  The
former is <kbd>C-x&nbsp;4&nbsp;.</kbd><!-- /@w -->
(<code>xref-find-definitions-other-window</code>), and the latter is
<kbd>C-x&nbsp;5&nbsp;.</kbd><!-- /@w -->  (<code>xref-find-definitions-other-frame</code>).

   <p><a name="index-xref_002dfind_002dapropos-3132"></a><a name="index-C_002dM_002d_002e-3133"></a>  The command <kbd>C-M-.</kbd> (<code>xref-find-apropos</code>) finds the
definitions of one or more identifiers that match a specified regular
expression.  It is just like <kbd>M-.</kbd> except that it does regexp
matching of identifiers instead of matching symbol names as fixed
strings.

   <p>When any of the above commands finds more than one definition, it
presents the <samp><span class="file">*xref*</span></samp> buffer showing the definition candidates. 
In that buffer, you have several specialized commands, described in
<a href="#Xref-Commands">Xref Commands</a>.

   <p><a name="index-M_002d_002c-3134"></a><a name="index-xref_002dpop_002dmarker_002dstack-3135"></a><a name="index-xref_002dmarker_002dring_002dlength-3136"></a>  To go back to places <em>from where</em> you found the definition,
use <kbd>M-,</kbd> (<code>xref-pop-marker-stack</code>).  It jumps back to the
point of the last invocation of <kbd>M-.</kbd>.  Thus you can find and
examine the definition of something with <kbd>M-.</kbd> and then return to
where you were with <kbd>M-,</kbd>.  <kbd>M-,</kbd> allows you to retrace your
steps to a depth determined by the variable
<code>xref-marker-ring-length</code>, which defaults to 16.

<p><a name="index-search-and-replace-in-multiple-files-3144"></a><a name="index-multiple_002dfile-search-and-replace-3145"></a>
  The commands in this section perform various search and replace
operations either on identifiers themselves or on files that reference
them.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-?</kbd><dd>Find all the references for the identifier at point. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x xref-query-replace-in-results &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>regexp</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>replacement</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Interactively replace <var>regexp</var> with <var>replacement</var> in the names

<br><dt><kbd>M-x tags-search &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>regexp</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Search for <var>regexp</var> through the files in the selected tags
table. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x tags-query-replace &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>regexp</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>replacement</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Perform a <code>query-replace-regexp</code> on each file in the selected tags table. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x tags-loop-continue</kbd><dd>Restart one of the last 2 commands above, from the current location of point. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-M_002d_003f-3146"></a><a name="index-xref_002dfind_002dreferences-3147"></a>  <kbd>M-?</kbd> finds all the references for the identifier at point.  If
there's no identifier at point, or when invoked with a prefix
argument, the command prompts for the identifier, with completion.  It
then presents a <samp><span class="file">*xref*</span></samp> buffer with all the references to the
identifier, showing the file name and the line where the identifier is
referenced.  The XREF mode commands are available in this buffer, see
<a href="#Xref-Commands">Xref Commands</a>.

   <p><a name="index-xref_002dquery_002dreplace_002din_002dresults-3148"></a>  <kbd>M-x xref-query-replace-in-results</kbd> reads a regexp to match identifier
names and a replacement string, just like ordinary <kbd>M-x
query-replace-regexp</kbd>.  It then performs the specified replacement in
the names of the matching identifiers in all the places in all the
files where these identifiers are referenced.  This is useful when you
rename your identifiers as part of refactoring.  This command should
be invoked in the <samp><span class="file">*xref*</span></samp> buffer generated by <code>M-?</code>.

   <p><a name="index-tags_002dsearch-3149"></a>  <kbd>M-x tags-search</kbd> reads a regexp using the minibuffer, then
searches for matches in all the files in the selected tags table, one
file at a time.  It displays the name of the file being searched so
you can follow its progress.  As soon as it finds an occurrence,
<code>tags-search</code> returns.  This command requires tags tables to be
available (see <a href="#Tags-Tables">Tags Tables</a>).

   <p><a name="index-tags_002dloop_002dcontinue-3150"></a>  Having found one match with <code>tags-search</code>, you probably want to
find all the rest.  Type <kbd>M-x tags-loop-continue</kbd> to resume the
<code>tags-search</code>, finding one more match.  This searches the rest of
the current buffer, followed by the remaining files of the tags table.

   <p><a name="index-tags_002dquery_002dreplace-3151"></a>  <kbd>M-x tags-query-replace</kbd> performs a single
<code>query-replace-regexp</code> through all the files in the tags table.  It
reads a regexp to search for and a string to replace with, just like
ordinary <kbd>M-x query-replace-regexp</kbd>.  It searches much like <kbd>M-x
tags-search</kbd>, but repeatedly, processing matches according to your
input.  See <a href="#Query-Replace">Query Replace</a>, for more information on query replace.

   <p><a name="index-tags_002dcase_002dfold_002dsearch-3152"></a><a name="index-case_002dsensitivity-and-tags-search-3153"></a>  You can control the case-sensitivity of tags search commands by
customizing the value of the variable <code>tags-case-fold-search</code>.  The
default is to use the same setting as the value of
<code>case-fold-search</code> (see <a href="#Lax-Search">Lax Search</a>).

   <p>It is possible to get through all the files in the tags table with a
single invocation of <kbd>M-x tags-query-replace</kbd>.  But often it is
useful to exit temporarily, which you can do with any input event that
has no special query replace meaning.  You can resume the query
replace subsequently by typing <kbd>M-x tags-loop-continue</kbd>; this
command resumes the last tags search or replace command that you did. 
For instance, to skip the rest of the current file, you can type
<kbd>M-&gt;&nbsp;M-x&nbsp;tags-loop-continue</kbd><!-- /@w -->.

   <p>Note that the commands described above carry out much broader
searches than the <code>xref-find-definitions</code> family.  The
<code>xref-find-definitions</code> commands search only for definitions of
identifiers that match your string or regexp.  The commands
<code>xref-find-references</code>, <code>tags-search</code>, and
<code>tags-query-replace</code> find every occurrence of the identifier or
regexp, as ordinary search commands and replace commands do in the
current buffer.

   <p>As an alternative to <code>xref-find-references</code> and
<code>tags-search</code>, you can run <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp> as a subprocess and
have Emacs show you the matching lines one by one.  See <a href="#Grep-Searching">Grep Searching</a>.

   <p><a name="index-completion-_0028symbol-names_0029-3154"></a>  In most programming language modes, you can type <kbd>C-M-i</kbd> or
<kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> (<code>completion-at-point</code>) to complete the symbol
at point.  Some modes provide specialized completion for this command
tailored to the mode; for those that don't, if there is a tags table
loaded, this command can use it to generate completion candidates. 
See <a href="#Symbol-Completion">Symbol Completion</a>.

   <p><a name="index-list_002dtags-3155"></a>  <kbd>M-x list-tags</kbd> reads the name of one of the files covered by
the selected tags table, and displays a list of tags defined in that
file.  Do not include a directory as part of the file name unless the
file name recorded in the tags table includes a directory.  This
command works only with the etags backend, and requires a tags table
for the project to be available.  See <a href="#Tags-Tables">Tags Tables</a>.

<!-- Sadly, the new-and-improved Xref feature doesn't provide anything -->

<h4 class="subsection">28.3.2 Tags Tables</h4>

<p><a name="index-tags-and-tag-tables-3157"></a>
  A <dfn>tags table</dfn> records the tags<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-13" name="fnd-13"><sup>13</sup></a> extracted by scanning the source code of a certain program or a
certain document.  Tags extracted from generated files reference the
original files, rather than the generated files that were scanned
during tag extraction.  Examples of generated files include C files
generated from Cweb source files, from a Yacc parser, or from Lex
scanner definitions; <samp><span class="file">.i</span></samp> preprocessed C files; and Fortran files
produced by preprocessing <samp><span class="file">.fpp</span></samp> source files.

   <p><a name="index-etags-3158"></a>  To produce a tags table, you run the <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp> shell command
on a document or the source code file.  The `<samp><span class="samp">etags</span></samp>' program
writes the tags to a <dfn>tags table file</dfn>, or <dfn>tags file</dfn> in
short.  The conventional name for a tags file is <samp><span class="file">TAGS</span></samp>. 
See <a href="#Create-Tags-Table">Create Tags Table</a>.  (It is also possible to create a tags table
by using one of the commands from other packages that can produce such
tables in the same format.)

   <p>Emacs uses the tags tables via the <code>etags</code> package as one of
the supported backends for <code>xref</code>.  Because tags tables are
produced by the <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp> command that is part of an Emacs
distribution, we describe tags tables in more detail here.

<h5 class="subsubsection">28.3.2.1 Source File Tag Syntax</h5>

<p>Here is how tag syntax is defined for the most popular languages:

     <ul>
<li>In C code, any C function or typedef is a tag, and so are definitions of
<code>struct</code>, <code>union</code> and <code>enum</code>. 
<code>#define</code> macro definitions, <code>#undef</code> and <code>enum</code>
constants are also
tags, unless you specify `<samp><span class="samp">--no-defines</span></samp>' when making the tags table. 
Similarly, global variables are tags, unless you specify
`<samp><span class="samp">--no-globals</span></samp>', and so are struct members, unless you specify
`<samp><span class="samp">--no-members</span></samp>'.  Use of `<samp><span class="samp">--no-globals</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">--no-defines</span></samp>'
and `<samp><span class="samp">--no-members</span></samp>' can make the tags table file much smaller.

     <p>You can tag function declarations and external variables in addition
to function definitions by giving the `<samp><span class="samp">--declarations</span></samp>' option to
<samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp>.

     <li>In C++ code, in addition to all the tag constructs of C code, member
functions are also recognized; member variables are also recognized,
unless you use the `<samp><span class="samp">--no-members</span></samp>' option.  Tags for variables and
functions in classes are named `<samp><var>class</var><span class="samp">::</span><var>variable</var></samp>' and
`<samp><var>class</var><span class="samp">::</span><var>function</var></samp>'.  <code>operator</code> definitions have
tag names like `<samp><span class="samp">operator+</span></samp>'.

     <li>In Java code, tags include all the constructs recognized in C++, plus
the <code>interface</code>, <code>extends</code> and <code>implements</code> constructs. 
Tags for variables and functions in classes are named
`<samp><var>class</var><span class="samp">.</span><var>variable</var></samp>' and `<samp><var>class</var><span class="samp">.</span><var>function</var></samp>'.

     <li>In LaTeX documents, the arguments for <code>\chapter</code>,
<code>\section</code>, <code>\subsection</code>, <code>\subsubsection</code>,
<code>\eqno</code>, <code>\label</code>, <code>\ref</code>, <code>\cite</code>,
<code>\bibitem</code>, <code>\part</code>, <code>\appendix</code>, <code>\entry</code>,
<code>\index</code>, <code>\def</code>, <code>\newcommand</code>, <code>\renewcommand</code>,
<code>\newenvironment</code> and <code>\renewenvironment</code> are tags.

     <p>Other commands can make tags as well, if you specify them in the
environment variable <samp><span class="env">TEXTAGS</span></samp> before invoking <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp>.  The
value of this environment variable should be a colon-separated list of
command names.  For example,

     <pre class="example">          TEXTAGS="mycommand:myothercommand"
          export TEXTAGS
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">specifies (using Bourne shell syntax) that the commands
`<samp><span class="samp">\mycommand</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">\myothercommand</span></samp>' also define tags.

     <li>In Lisp code, any function defined with <code>defun</code>, any variable
defined with <code>defvar</code> or <code>defconst</code>, and in general the
first argument of any expression that starts with `<samp><span class="samp">(def</span></samp>' in
column zero is a tag.  As an exception, expressions of the form
<code>(defvar </code><var>foo</var><code>)</code> are treated as declarations, and are only
tagged if the `<samp><span class="samp">--declarations</span></samp>' option is given.

     <li>In Scheme code, tags include anything defined with <code>def</code> or with a
construct whose name starts with `<samp><span class="samp">def</span></samp>'.  They also include variables
set with <code>set!</code> at top level in the file. 
</ul>

   <p>Several other languages are also supported:

     <ul>
<li>In Ada code, functions, procedures, packages, tasks and types are
tags.  Use the `<samp><span class="samp">--packages-only</span></samp>' option to create tags for
packages only.

     <p>In Ada, the same name can be used for different kinds of entity
(e.g., for a procedure and for a function).  Also, for things like
packages, procedures and functions, there is the spec (i.e., the
interface) and the body (i.e., the implementation).  To make it
easier to pick the definition you want, Ada tag name have suffixes
indicating the type of entity:

          <dl>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">/b</span></samp>'<dd>package body. 
<br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">/f</span></samp>'<dd>function. 
<br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">/k</span></samp>'<dd>task. 
<br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">/p</span></samp>'<dd>procedure. 
<br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">/s</span></samp>'<dd>package spec. 
<br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">/t</span></samp>'<dd>type. 
</dl>

     <p>Thus, <kbd>M-x find-tag &lt;RET&gt; bidule/b &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> will go
directly to the body of the package <code>bidule</code>, while <kbd>M-x
find-tag &lt;RET&gt; bidule &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> will just search for any tag
<code>bidule</code>.

     <li>In assembler code, labels appearing at the start of a line,
followed by a colon, are tags.

     <li>In Bison or Yacc input files, each rule defines as a tag the nonterminal
it constructs.  The portions of the file that contain C code are parsed
as C code.

     <li>In Cobol code, tags are paragraph names; that is, any word starting in
column 8 and followed by a period.

     <li>In Erlang code, the tags are the functions, records and macros defined
in the file.

     <li>In Fortran code, functions, subroutines and block data are tags.

     <li>In Go code, packages, functions, and types are tags.

     <li>In HTML input files, the tags are the <code>title</code> and the <code>h1</code>,
<code>h2</code>, <code>h3</code> headers.  Also, tags are <code>name=</code> in anchors
and all occurrences of <code>id=</code>.

     <li>In Lua input files, all functions are tags.

     <li>In makefiles, targets are tags; additionally, variables are tags
unless you specify `<samp><span class="samp">--no-globals</span></samp>'.

     <li>In Objective C code, tags include Objective C definitions for classes,
class categories, methods and protocols.  Tags for variables and
functions in classes are named `<samp><var>class</var><span class="samp">::</span><var>variable</var></samp>' and
`<samp><var>class</var><span class="samp">::</span><var>function</var></samp>'.

     <li>In Pascal code, the tags are the functions and procedures defined in
the file.

     <li>In Perl code, the tags are the packages, subroutines and variables
defined by the <code>package</code>, <code>sub</code>, <code>use constant</code>,
<code>my</code>, and <code>local</code> keywords.  Use `<samp><span class="samp">--globals</span></samp>' if you
want to tag global variables.  Tags for subroutines are named
`<samp><var>package</var><span class="samp">::</span><var>sub</var></samp>'.  The name for subroutines defined in
the default package is `<samp><span class="samp">main::</span><var>sub</var></samp>'.

     <li>In PHP code, tags are functions, classes and defines.  Vars are tags
too, unless you use the `<samp><span class="samp">--no-members</span></samp>' option.

     <li>In PostScript code, the tags are the functions.

     <li>In Prolog code, tags are predicates and rules at the beginning of
line.

     <li>In Python code, <code>def</code> or <code>class</code> at the beginning of a line
generate a tag.

     <li>In Ruby code, <code>def</code> or <code>class</code> or <code>module</code> at the
beginning of a line generate a tag.  Constants also generate tags. 
</ul>

   <p>You can also generate tags based on regexp matching (see <a href="#Etags-Regexps">Etags Regexps</a>) to handle other formats and languages.

<h5 class="subsubsection">28.3.2.2 Creating Tags Tables</h5>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040command_007betags_007d-program-3163"></a>
  The <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp> program is used to create a tags table file.  It knows
the syntax of several languages, as described in
<a href="#Tag-Syntax">Tag Syntax</a>. 
Here is how to run <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp>:

<pre class="example">     etags <var>inputfiles</var>...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp> program reads the specified files, and writes a tags
table named <samp><span class="file">TAGS</span></samp> in the current working directory.  You can
optionally specify a different file name for the tags table by using the
`<samp><span class="samp">--output=</span><var>file</var></samp>' option; specifying <samp><span class="file">-</span></samp> as a file name
prints the tags table to standard output.

   <p>If the specified files don't exist, <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp> looks for
compressed versions of them and uncompresses them to read them.  Under
MS-DOS, <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp> also looks for file names like <samp><span class="file">mycode.cgz</span></samp>
if it is given `<samp><span class="samp">mycode.c</span></samp>' on the command line and <samp><span class="file">mycode.c</span></samp>
does not exist.

   <p>If the tags table becomes outdated due to changes in the files
described in it, you can update it by running the <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp>
program again.  If the tags table does not record a tag, or records it
for the wrong file, then Emacs will not be able to find that
definition until you update the tags table.  But if the position
recorded in the tags table becomes a little bit wrong (due to other
editing), Emacs will still be able to find the right position, with a
slight delay.

   <p>Thus, there is no need to update the tags table after each edit. 
You should update a tags table when you define new tags that you want
to have listed, or when you move tag definitions from one file to
another, or when changes become substantial.

   <p>You can make a tags table <dfn>include</dfn> another tags table, by
passing the `<samp><span class="samp">--include=</span><var>file</var></samp>' option to <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp>.  It
then covers all the files covered by the included tags file, as well
as its own.

   <p>If you specify the source files with relative file names when you run
<samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp>, the tags file will contain file names relative to the
directory where the tags file was initially written.  This way, you can
move an entire directory tree containing both the tags file and the
source files, and the tags file will still refer correctly to the source
files.  If the tags file is <samp><span class="file">-</span></samp> or is in the <samp><span class="file">/dev</span></samp> directory,
however, the file names are
made relative to the current working directory.  This is useful, for
example, when writing the tags to the standard output.

   <p>When using a relative file name, it should not be a symbolic link
pointing to a tags file in a different directory, because this would
generally render the file names invalid.

   <p>If you specify absolute file names as arguments to <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp>, then
the tags file will contain absolute file names.  This way, the tags file
will still refer to the same files even if you move it, as long as the
source files remain in the same place.  Absolute file names start with
`<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>', or with `<samp><var>device</var><span class="samp">:/</span></samp>' on MS-DOS and MS-Windows.

   <p>When you want to make a tags table from a great number of files,
you may have problems listing them on the command line, because some
systems have a limit on its length.  You can circumvent this limit by
telling <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp> to read the file names from its standard
input, by typing a dash in place of the file names, like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     find . -name "*.[chCH]" -print | etags -
</pre>
   <p><samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp> recognizes the language used in an input file based
on its file name and contents.  You can specify the language
explicitly with the `<samp><span class="samp">--language=</span><var>name</var></samp>' option.  You can
intermix these options with file names; each one applies to the file
names that follow it.  Specify `<samp><span class="samp">--language=auto</span></samp>' to tell
<samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp> to resume guessing the language from the file names
and file contents.  Specify `<samp><span class="samp">--language=none</span></samp>' to turn off
language-specific processing entirely; then <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp> recognizes
tags by regexp matching alone (see <a href="#Etags-Regexps">Etags Regexps</a>).

   <p>The option `<samp><span class="samp">--parse-stdin=</span><var>file</var></samp>' is mostly useful when
calling <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp> from programs.  It can be used (only once) in
place of a file name on the command line.  <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp> will read from
standard input and mark the produced tags as belonging to the file
<var>file</var>.

   <p>`<samp><span class="samp">etags --help</span></samp>' outputs the list of the languages <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp>
knows, and the file name rules for guessing the language.  It also prints
a list of all the available <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp> options, together with a short
explanation.  If followed by one or more `<samp><span class="samp">--language=</span><var>lang</var></samp>'
options, it outputs detailed information about how tags are generated for
<var>lang</var>.

<h5 class="subsubsection">28.3.2.3 Etags Regexps</h5>

<p>The `<samp><span class="samp">--regex</span></samp>' option to <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp> allows tags to be
recognized by regular expression matching.  You can intermix this
option with file names; each one applies to the source files that
follow it.  If you specify multiple `<samp><span class="samp">--regex</span></samp>' options, all of
them are used in parallel.  The syntax is:

<pre class="smallexample">     --regex=[<var>{language}</var>]/<var>tagregexp</var>/[<var>nameregexp</var>/]<var>modifiers</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The essential part of the option value is <var>tagregexp</var>, the regexp
for matching tags.  It is always used anchored, that is, it only
matches at the beginning of a line.  If you want to allow indented
tags, use a regexp that matches initial whitespace; start it with
`<samp><span class="samp">[ \t]*</span></samp>'.

   <p>In these regular expressions, `<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>' quotes the next character, and
all the GCC character escape sequences are supported (`<samp><span class="samp">\a</span></samp>' for
bell, `<samp><span class="samp">\b</span></samp>' for back space, `<samp><span class="samp">\d</span></samp>' for delete, `<samp><span class="samp">\e</span></samp>' for
escape, `<samp><span class="samp">\f</span></samp>' for formfeed, `<samp><span class="samp">\n</span></samp>' for newline, `<samp><span class="samp">\r</span></samp>' for
carriage return, `<samp><span class="samp">\t</span></samp>' for tab, and `<samp><span class="samp">\v</span></samp>' for vertical tab).

   <p>Ideally, <var>tagregexp</var> should not match more characters than are
needed to recognize what you want to tag.  If the syntax requires you
to write <var>tagregexp</var> so it matches more characters beyond the tag
itself, you should add a <var>nameregexp</var>, to pick out just the tag. 
This will enable Emacs to find tags more accurately and to do
completion on tag names more reliably.  You can find some examples
below.

   <p>The <var>modifiers</var> are a sequence of zero or more characters that
modify the way <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp> does the matching.  A regexp with no
modifiers is applied sequentially to each line of the input file, in a
case-sensitive way.  The modifiers and their meanings are:

     <dl>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">i</span></samp>'<dd>Ignore case when matching this regexp. 
<br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">m</span></samp>'<dd>Match this regular expression against the whole file, so that
multi-line matches are possible. 
<br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">s</span></samp>'<dd>Match this regular expression against the whole file, and allow
`<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>' in <var>tagregexp</var> to match newlines. 
</dl>

   <p>The `<samp><span class="samp">-R</span></samp>' option cancels all the regexps defined by preceding
`<samp><span class="samp">--regex</span></samp>' options.  It too applies to the file names following
it.  Here's an example:

<pre class="smallexample">     etags --regex=/<var>reg1</var>/i voo.doo --regex=/<var>reg2</var>/m \
         bar.ber -R --lang=lisp los.er
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp> chooses the parsing language for <samp><span class="file">voo.doo</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">bar.ber</span></samp> according to their contents.  <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp> also uses
<var>reg1</var> to recognize additional tags in <samp><span class="file">voo.doo</span></samp>, and both
<var>reg1</var> and <var>reg2</var> to recognize additional tags in
<samp><span class="file">bar.ber</span></samp>.  <var>reg1</var> is checked against each line of
<samp><span class="file">voo.doo</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">bar.ber</span></samp>, in a case-insensitive way, while
<var>reg2</var> is checked against the whole <samp><span class="file">bar.ber</span></samp> file,
permitting multi-line matches, in a case-sensitive way.  <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp>
uses only the Lisp tags rules, with no user-specified regexp matching,
to recognize tags in <samp><span class="file">los.er</span></samp>.

   <p>You can restrict a `<samp><span class="samp">--regex</span></samp>' option to match only files of a
given language by using the optional prefix <var>{language}</var>. 
(`<samp><span class="samp">etags --help</span></samp>' prints the list of languages recognized by
<samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp>.)  This is particularly useful when storing many
predefined regular expressions for <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp> in a file.  The
following example tags the <code>DEFVAR</code> macros in the Emacs source
files, for the C language only:

<pre class="smallexample">     --regex='{c}/[ \t]*DEFVAR_[A-Z_ \t(]+"\([^"]+\)"/'
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">When you have complex regular expressions, you can store the list of
them in a file.  The following option syntax instructs <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp> to
read two files of regular expressions.  The regular expressions
contained in the second file are matched without regard to case.

<pre class="smallexample">     --regex=@<var>case-sensitive-file</var> --ignore-case-regex=@<var>ignore-case-file</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">A regex file for <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp> contains one regular expression per
line.  Empty lines, and lines beginning with space or tab are ignored. 
When the first character in a line is `<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>', <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp> assumes
that the rest of the line is the name of another file of regular
expressions; thus, one such file can include another file.  All the
other lines are taken to be regular expressions.  If the first
non-whitespace text on the line is `<samp><span class="samp">--</span></samp>', that line is a comment.

   <p>For example, we can create a file called `<samp><span class="samp">emacs.tags</span></samp>' with the
following contents:

<pre class="smallexample">             -- This is for GNU Emacs C source files
     {c}/[ \t]*DEFVAR_[A-Z_ \t(]+"\([^"]+\)"/\1/
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and then use it like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     etags --regex=@emacs.tags *.[ch] */*.[ch]
</pre>
   <p>Here are some more examples.  The regexps are quoted to protect them
from shell interpretation.

     <ul>
<li>Tag Octave files:

     <pre class="smallexample">          etags --language=none \
                --regex='/[ \t]*function.*=[ \t]*\([^ \t]*\)[ \t]*(/\1/' \
                --regex='/###key \(.*\)/\1/' \
                --regex='/[ \t]*global[ \t].*/' \
                *.m
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">Note that tags are not generated for scripts, so that you have to add
a line by yourself of the form `<samp><span class="samp">###key </span><var>scriptname</var></samp>' if you
want to jump to it.

     <li>Tag Tcl files:

     <pre class="smallexample">          etags --language=none --regex='/proc[ \t]+\([^ \t]+\)/\1/' *.tcl
     </pre>
     <li>Tag VHDL files:

     <pre class="smallexample">          etags --language=none \
            --regex='/[ \t]*\(ARCHITECTURE\|CONFIGURATION\) +[^ ]* +OF/' \
            --regex='/[ \t]*\(ATTRIBUTE\|ENTITY\|FUNCTION\|PACKAGE\
            \( BODY\)?\|PROCEDURE\|PROCESS\|TYPE\)[ \t]+\([^ \t(]+\)/\3/'

<h4 class="subsection">28.3.3 Selecting a Tags Table</h4>

<p><a name="index-visit_002dtags_002dtable-3164"></a>  Emacs has at any time at most one <dfn>selected</dfn> tags table.  All the
commands for working with tags tables use the selected one.  To select
a tags table, type <kbd>M-x visit-tags-table</kbd>, which reads the tags
table file name as an argument, with <samp><span class="file">TAGS</span></samp> in the default
directory as the default.

   <p><a name="index-tags_002dfile_002dname-3165"></a>  Emacs does not actually read in the tags table contents until you
try to use them; all <code>visit-tags-table</code> does is store the file
name in the variable <code>tags-file-name</code>, and setting the variable
yourself is just as good.  The variable's initial value is <code>nil</code>;
that value tells all the commands for working with tags tables that
they must ask for a tags table file name to use.

   <p>Using <code>visit-tags-table</code> when a tags table is already loaded
gives you a choice: you can add the new tags table to the current list
of tags tables, or start a new list.  The tags commands use all the tags
tables in the current list.  If you start a new list, the new tags table
is used <em>instead</em> of others.  If you add the new table to the
current list, it is used <em>as well as</em> the others.

   <p><a name="index-tags_002dtable_002dlist-3166"></a>  You can specify a precise list of tags tables by setting the variable
<code>tags-table-list</code> to a list of strings, like this:

<!-- keep this on two lines for formatting in smallbook -->
<pre class="example">     (setq tags-table-list
           '("~/emacs" "/usr/local/lib/emacs/src"))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This tells the tags commands to look at the <samp><span class="file">TAGS</span></samp> files in your
<samp><span class="file">~/emacs</span></samp> directory and in the <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/lib/emacs/src</span></samp>
directory.  The order depends on which file you are in and which tags
table mentions that file, as explained above.

   <p>Do not set both <code>tags-file-name</code> and <code>tags-table-list</code>.

EDE (<dfn>Emacs Development Environment</dfn>) is a package that simplifies
the task of creating, building, and debugging large programs with
Emacs.  It provides some of the features of an IDE, or <dfn>Integrated
Development Environment</dfn>, in Emacs.

   <p>This section provides a brief description of EDE usage. 
For full details, see <a href="ede.html#Top">EDE</a>.

   <p>EDE is implemented as a global minor mode (see <a href="#Minor-Modes">Minor Modes</a>).  To
enable it, type <kbd>M-x global-ede-mode</kbd> or click on the
`<samp><span class="samp">Project Support (EDE)</span></samp>' item in the `<samp><span class="samp">Tools</span></samp>' menu.  You can
also enable EDE each time you start Emacs, by adding the following
line to your initialization file:

<pre class="smallexample">     (global-ede-mode t)

   <p class="noindent">Activating EDE adds a menu named `<samp><span class="samp">Development</span></samp>' to the menu bar. 
Many EDE commands, including the ones described below, can be invoked
from this menu.

   <p>EDE organizes files into <dfn>projects</dfn>, which correspond to
directory trees.  The <dfn>project root</dfn> is the topmost directory of a
project.  To define a new project, visit a file in the desired project
root and type <kbd>M-x ede-new</kbd>.  This command prompts for a
<dfn>project type</dfn>, which refers to the underlying method that EDE
will use to manage the project (see <a href="ede.html#Creating-a-project">EDE</a>).  The most common project types are
`<samp><span class="samp">Make</span></samp>', which uses Makefiles, and `<samp><span class="samp">Automake</span></samp>', which uses GNU
Automake (see <a href="automake.html#Top">Automake</a>).  In both cases,
EDE also creates a file named <samp><span class="file">Project.ede</span></samp>, which stores
information about the project.

   <p>A project may contain one or more <dfn>targets</dfn>.  A target can be an
object file, executable program, or some other type of file, which is
built from one or more of the files in the project.

   <p>To add a new <dfn>target</dfn> to a project, type <kbd>C-c . t</kbd>
(<code>M-x ede-new-target</code>).  This command also asks if you wish to
add the current file to that target, which means that the target
is to be built from that file.  After you have defined a target, you
can add more files to it by typing <kbd>C-c . a</kbd>
(<code>ede-add-file</code>).

   <p>To build a target, type <kbd>C-c . c</kbd> (<code>ede-compile-target</code>). 
To build all the targets in the project, type <kbd>C-c . C</kbd>
(<code>ede-compile-project</code>).  EDE uses the file types to guess how
the target should be built.

<p><a name="index-Emerge-3170"></a><a name="index-merging-files-3171"></a>
  It's not unusual for programmers to get their signals crossed and
modify the same program in two different directions.  To recover from
this confusion, you need to merge the two versions.  Emerge makes this
easier.  For other ways to compare files, see
<a href="#Comparing-Files">Comparing Files</a>,
and <a href="ediff.html#Top">Ediff</a>.

<h4 class="subsection">28.5.1 Overview of Emerge</h4>

<p>To start Emerge, run one of these four commands:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-x emerge-files</kbd><dd><a name="index-emerge_002dfiles-3172"></a>Merge two specified files.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x emerge-files-with-ancestor</kbd><dd><a name="index-emerge_002dfiles_002dwith_002dancestor-3173"></a>Merge two specified files, with reference to a common ancestor.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x emerge-buffers</kbd><dd><a name="index-emerge_002dbuffers-3174"></a>Merge two buffers.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x emerge-buffers-with-ancestor</kbd><dd><a name="index-emerge_002dbuffers_002dwith_002dancestor-3175"></a>Merge two buffers with reference to a common ancestor in a third
buffer. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-merge-buffer-_0028Emerge_0029-3176"></a><a name="index-A-and-B-buffers-_0028Emerge_0029-3177"></a>  The Emerge commands compare two files or buffers, and display the
comparison in three buffers: one for each input text (the <dfn>A buffer</dfn>
and the <dfn>B buffer</dfn>), and one (the <dfn>merge buffer</dfn>) where merging
takes place.  The merge buffer shows the full merged text, not just the
differences.  Wherever the two input texts differ, you can choose which
one of them to include in the merge buffer.

   <p>The Emerge commands that take input from existing buffers use only
the accessible portions of those buffers, if they are narrowed. 
See <a href="#Narrowing">Narrowing</a>.

   <p>If a common ancestor version is available, from which the two texts to
be merged were both derived, Emerge can use it to guess which
alternative is right.  Wherever one current version agrees with the
ancestor, Emerge presumes that the other current version is a deliberate
change which should be kept in the merged version.  Use the
`<samp><span class="samp">with-ancestor</span></samp>' commands if you want to specify a common ancestor
text.  These commands read three file or buffer names&mdash;variant A,
variant B, and the common ancestor.

   <p>After the comparison is done and the buffers are prepared, the
interactive merging starts.  You control the merging by typing special
<dfn>merge commands</dfn> in the merge buffer (see <a href="#Merge-Commands">Merge Commands</a>). 
For each run of differences between the input texts, you can choose
which one of them to keep, or edit them both together.

   <p>The merge buffer uses a special major mode, Emerge mode, with commands
for making these choices.  But you can also edit the buffer with
ordinary Emacs commands.

   <p>At any given time, the attention of Emerge is focused on one
particular difference, called the <dfn>selected</dfn> difference.  This
difference is marked off in the three buffers like this:

<pre class="example">     vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
     <var>text that differs</var>
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Emerge numbers all the differences sequentially and the mode
line always shows the number of the selected difference.

   <p>Normally, the merge buffer starts out with the A version of the text. 
But when the A version of a difference agrees with the common ancestor,
then the B version is initially preferred for that difference.

   <p>Emerge leaves the merged text in the merge buffer when you exit.  At
that point, you can save it in a file with <kbd>C-x C-w</kbd>.  If you give a
numeric argument to <code>emerge-files</code> or
<code>emerge-files-with-ancestor</code>, it reads the name of the output file
using the minibuffer.  (This is the last file name those commands read.) 
Then exiting from Emerge saves the merged text in the output file.

   <p>Normally, Emerge commands save the output buffer in its file when you
exit.  If you abort Emerge with <kbd>C-]</kbd>, the Emerge command does not
save the output buffer, but you can save it yourself if you wish.

<h4 class="subsection">28.5.2 Submodes of Emerge</h4>

<p>You can choose between two modes for giving merge commands: Fast mode
and Edit mode.  In Fast mode, basic merge commands are single
characters, but ordinary Emacs commands are disabled.  This is
convenient if you use only merge commands.  In Edit mode, all merge
commands start with the prefix key <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>, and the normal Emacs
commands are also available.  This allows editing the merge buffer, but
slows down Emerge operations.

   <p>Use <kbd>e</kbd> to switch to Edit mode, and <kbd>C-c C-c f</kbd> to switch to
Fast mode.  The mode line indicates Edit and Fast modes with `<samp><span class="samp">E</span></samp>'
and `<samp><span class="samp">F</span></samp>'.

   <p>Emerge has two additional submodes that affect how particular merge
commands work: Auto Advance mode and Skip Prefers mode.

   <p>If Auto Advance mode is in effect, the <kbd>a</kbd> and <kbd>b</kbd> commands
advance to the next difference.  This lets you go through the merge
faster as long as you simply choose one of the alternatives from the
input.  The mode line indicates Auto Advance mode with `<samp><span class="samp">A</span></samp>'.

   <p>If Skip Prefers mode is in effect, the <kbd>n</kbd> and <kbd>p</kbd> commands
skip over differences in states &ldquo;prefer-A&rdquo; and &ldquo;prefer-B&rdquo;
(see <a href="#State-of-Difference">State of Difference</a>).  Thus you see only differences for
which neither version is presumed correct.  The mode line
indicates Skip Prefers mode with `<samp><span class="samp">S</span></samp>'.  This mode is only relevant
when there is an ancestor.

   <p><a name="index-emerge_002dauto_002dadvance-3178"></a><a name="index-emerge_002dskip_002dprefers-3179"></a>  Use the command <kbd>s a</kbd> (<code>emerge-auto-advance</code>) to set or clear
Auto Advance mode.  Use <kbd>s s</kbd> (<code>emerge-skip-prefers</code>) to set or
clear Skip Prefers mode.  These commands turn on the mode with a
positive argument, turn it off with a negative or zero argument, and
toggle the mode with no argument.

<h4 class="subsection">28.5.3 State of a Difference</h4>

<p>In the merge buffer, a difference is marked with lines of `<samp><span class="samp">v</span></samp>' and
`<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>' characters.  Each difference has one of these seven states:

     <dl>
<dt>A<dd>The difference is showing the A version.  The <kbd>a</kbd> command always
produces this state; the mode line indicates it with `<samp><span class="samp">A</span></samp>'.

     <br><dt>B<dd>The difference is showing the B version.  The <kbd>b</kbd> command always
produces this state; the mode line indicates it with `<samp><span class="samp">B</span></samp>'.

     <br><dt>default-A<dt>default-B<dd>The difference is showing the A or the B state by default, because you
haven't made a choice.  All differences start in the default-A state
(and thus the merge buffer is a copy of the A buffer), except those for
which one alternative is preferred (see below).

     <p>When you select a difference, its state changes from default-A or
default-B to plain A or B.  Thus, the selected difference never has
state default-A or default-B, and these states are never displayed in
the mode line.

     <p>The command <kbd>d a</kbd> chooses default-A as the default state, and <kbd>d
b</kbd> chooses default-B.  This chosen default applies to all differences
that you have never selected and for which no alternative is preferred. 
If you are moving through the merge sequentially, the differences you
haven't selected are those following the selected one.  Thus, while
moving sequentially, you can effectively make the A version the default
for some sections of the merge buffer and the B version the default for
others by using <kbd>d a</kbd> and <kbd>d b</kbd> between sections.

     <br><dt>prefer-A<dt>prefer-B<dd>The difference is showing the A or B state because it is
<dfn>preferred</dfn>.  This means that you haven't made an explicit choice,
but one alternative seems likely to be right because the other
alternative agrees with the common ancestor.  Thus, where the A buffer
agrees with the common ancestor, the B version is preferred, because
chances are it is the one that was actually changed.

     <p>These two states are displayed in the mode line as `<samp><span class="samp">A*</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">B*</span></samp>'.

     <br><dt>combined<dd>The difference is showing a combination of the A and B states, as a
result of the <kbd>x c</kbd> or <kbd>x C</kbd> commands.

     <p>Once a difference is in this state, the <kbd>a</kbd> and <kbd>b</kbd> commands
don't do anything to it unless you give them a numeric argument.

     <p>The mode line displays this state as `<samp><span class="samp">comb</span></samp>'.

A and B buffers to their proper contents, or kills them if they were
created by Emerge and you haven't changed them.  It also disables the
Emerge commands in the merge buffer, since executing them later could
damage the contents of the various buffers.

   <p><kbd>C-]</kbd> aborts the merge.  This means exiting without writing the
output file.  If you didn't specify an output file, then there is no
real difference between aborting and finishing the merge.

   <p>If the Emerge command was called from another Lisp program, then its
return value is <code>t</code> for successful completion, or <code>nil</code> if you
abort.

<h4 class="subsection">28.5.6 Combining the Two Versions</h4>

<p>Sometimes you want to keep <em>both</em> alternatives for a particular
difference.  To do this, use <kbd>x c</kbd>, which edits the merge buffer
like this:

<pre class="example">     #ifdef NEW
     <var>version from B buffer</var>
     #else /* not NEW */
     <var>version from A buffer</var>
     #endif /* not NEW */
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><a name="index-emerge_002dcombine_002dversions_002dtemplate-3180"></a>While this example shows C preprocessor conditionals delimiting the two
alternative versions, you can specify the strings to use by setting
the variable <code>emerge-combine-versions-template</code> to a string of your
choice.  In the string, `<samp><span class="samp">%a</span></samp>' says where to put version A, and
`<samp><span class="samp">%b</span></samp>' says where to put version B.  The default setting, which
produces the results shown above, looks like this:

<pre class="example">     "#ifdef NEW\n%b#else /* not NEW */\n%a#endif /* not NEW */\n"

<h4 class="subsection">28.5.7 Fine Points of Emerge</h4>

<p>During the merge, you mustn't try to edit the A and B buffers yourself. 
Emerge modifies them temporarily, but ultimately puts them back the way
they were.

   <p>You can have any number of merges going at once&mdash;just don't use any one
buffer as input to more than one merge at once, since the temporary
changes made in these buffers would get in each other's way.

   <p>Starting Emerge can take a long time because it needs to compare the
files fully.  Emacs can't do anything else until <code>diff</code> finishes. 
Perhaps in the future someone will change Emerge to do the comparison in
the background when the input files are large&mdash;then you could keep on
doing other things with Emacs until Emerge is ready to accept
commands.

   <p><a name="index-emerge_002dstartup_002dhook-3181"></a>  After setting up the merge, Emerge runs the hook
<code>emerge-startup-hook</code>.

<p><a name="index-abbrevs-3182"></a><a name="index-expansion-_0028of-abbrevs_0029-3183"></a>
  A defined <dfn>abbrev</dfn> is a word which <dfn>expands</dfn>, if you insert
it, into some different text.  Abbrevs are defined by the user to expand
in specific ways.  For example, you might define `<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>' as an abbrev
expanding to `<samp><span class="samp">find outer otter</span></samp>'.  Then you could insert
`<samp><span class="samp">find outer otter </span></samp>' into the buffer by typing <kbd>f o o
&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>.

   <p>A second kind of abbreviation facility is called <dfn>dynamic abbrev
expansion</dfn>.  You use dynamic abbrev expansion with an explicit command
to expand the letters in the buffer before point by looking for other
words in the buffer that start with those letters.  See <a href="#Dynamic-Abbrevs">Dynamic Abbrevs</a>.

   <p>A third kind, <dfn>hippie expansion</dfn>, generalizes abbreviation expansion.

<h3 class="section">29.1 Abbrev Concepts</h3>

<p>An <dfn>abbrev</dfn> is a word that has been defined to <dfn>expand</dfn> into
a specified <dfn>expansion</dfn>.  When you insert a word-separator character
following the abbrev, that expands the abbrev&mdash;replacing the abbrev
with its expansion.  For example, if `<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>' is defined as an abbrev
expanding to `<samp><span class="samp">find outer otter</span></samp>', then typing <kbd>f o o .</kbd> will
insert `<samp><span class="samp">find outer otter.</span></samp>'.

   <p><a name="index-abbrev_002dmode-3184"></a><a name="index-Abbrev-mode-3185"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Abbrev-3186"></a>  Abbrevs expand only when Abbrev mode, a buffer-local minor mode, is
enabled.  Disabling Abbrev mode does not cause abbrev definitions to
be forgotten, but they do not expand until Abbrev mode is enabled
again.  The command <kbd>M-x abbrev-mode</kbd> toggles Abbrev mode; with a
numeric argument, it turns Abbrev mode on if the argument is positive,
off otherwise.  See <a href="#Minor-Modes">Minor Modes</a>.

   <p>Abbrevs can have <dfn>mode-specific</dfn> definitions, active only in one major
mode.  Abbrevs can also have <dfn>global</dfn> definitions that are active in
all major modes.  The same abbrev can have a global definition and various
mode-specific definitions for different major modes.  A mode-specific
definition for the current major mode overrides a global definition.

   <p>You can define abbrevs interactively during the editing session,
irrespective of whether Abbrev mode is enabled.  You can also save
lists of abbrev definitions in files, which you can the reload for use
in later sessions.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-a-g-3187"></a><a name="index-add_002dglobal_002dabbrev-3188"></a>  The usual way to define an abbrev is to enter the text you want the
abbrev to expand to, position point after it, and type <kbd>C-x a g</kbd>
(<code>add-global-abbrev</code>).  This reads the abbrev itself using the
minibuffer, and then defines it as an abbrev for one or more words before
point.  Use a numeric argument to say how many words before point should be
taken as the expansion.  For example, to define the abbrev `<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>' as
mentioned above, insert the text `<samp><span class="samp">find outer otter</span></samp>' and then type
<kbd>C-u 3 C-x a g f o o &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.

   <p>An argument of zero to <kbd>C-x a g</kbd> means to use the contents of the
region as the expansion of the abbrev being defined.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-a-l-3189"></a><a name="index-add_002dmode_002dabbrev-3190"></a>  The command <kbd>C-x a l</kbd> (<code>add-mode-abbrev</code>) is similar, but
defines a mode-specific abbrev for the current major mode.  The
arguments work the same as for <kbd>C-x a g</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-a-i-g-3191"></a><a name="index-inverse_002dadd_002dglobal_002dabbrev-3192"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-a-i-l-3193"></a><a name="index-inverse_002dadd_002dmode_002dabbrev-3194"></a>  <kbd>C-x a i g</kbd> (<code>inverse-add-global-abbrev</code>) and <kbd>C-x a i
l</kbd> (<code>inverse-add-mode-abbrev</code>) perform the opposite task: if the
abbrev text is already in the buffer, you use these commands to define
an abbrev by specifying the expansion in the minibuffer.  These
commands will expand the abbrev text used for the definition.

   <p><a name="index-define_002dmode_002dabbrev-3195"></a><a name="index-define_002dglobal_002dabbrev-3196"></a>  You can define an abbrev without inserting either the abbrev or its
expansion in the buffer using the command <code>define-global-abbrev</code>. 
It reads two arguments&mdash;the abbrev, and its expansion.  The command
<code>define-mode-abbrev</code> does likewise for a mode-specific abbrev.

   <p>To change the definition of an abbrev, just make a new definition. 
When an abbrev has a prior definition, the abbrev definition commands
ask for confirmation before replacing it.

   <p><a name="index-kill_002dall_002dabbrevs-3197"></a>  To remove an abbrev definition, give a negative argument to the
abbrev definition command: <kbd>C-u - C-x a g</kbd> or <kbd>C-u - C-x a l</kbd>. 
The former removes a global definition, while the latter removes a
mode-specific definition.  <kbd>M-x kill-all-abbrevs</kbd> removes all
abbrev definitions, both global and local.

<h3 class="section">29.3 Controlling Abbrev Expansion</h3>

<p>When Abbrev mode is enabled, an abbrev expands whenever it is
present in the buffer just before point and you type a self-inserting
whitespace or punctuation character (&lt;SPC&gt;, comma, etc.).  More
precisely, any character that is not a word constituent expands an
abbrev, and any word-constituent character can be part of an abbrev. 
The most common way to use an abbrev is to insert it and then insert a
punctuation or whitespace character to expand it.

   <p><a name="index-abbrev_002dall_002dcaps-3198"></a>  Abbrev expansion preserves case: `<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>' expands to `<samp><span class="samp">find
outer otter</span></samp>', and `<samp><span class="samp">Foo</span></samp>' to `<samp><span class="samp">Find outer otter</span></samp>'.  `<samp><span class="samp">FOO</span></samp>'
expands to `<samp><span class="samp">Find Outer Otter</span></samp>' by default, but if you change the
variable <code>abbrev-all-caps</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> value, it expands
to `<samp><span class="samp">FIND OUTER OTTER</span></samp>'.

   <p>These commands are used to control abbrev expansion:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-'</kbd><dd>Separate a prefix from a following abbrev to be expanded
(<code>abbrev-prefix-mark</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x a e</kbd><dd><a name="index-expand_002dabbrev-3199"></a>Expand the abbrev before point (<code>expand-abbrev</code>). 
This is effective even when Abbrev mode is not enabled. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x expand-region-abbrevs</kbd><dd>Expand some or all abbrevs found in the region. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-M_002d_0027-3200"></a><a name="index-abbrev_002dprefix_002dmark-3201"></a>  You may wish to expand an abbrev and attach a prefix to the expansion;
for example, if `<samp><span class="samp">cnst</span></samp>' expands into `<samp><span class="samp">construction</span></samp>', you might want
to use it to enter `<samp><span class="samp">reconstruction</span></samp>'.  It does not work to type
<kbd>recnst</kbd>, because that is not necessarily a defined abbrev.  What
you can do is use the command <kbd>M-'</kbd> (<code>abbrev-prefix-mark</code>) in
between the prefix `<samp><span class="samp">re</span></samp>' and the abbrev `<samp><span class="samp">cnst</span></samp>'.  First, insert
`<samp><span class="samp">re</span></samp>'.  Then type <kbd>M-'</kbd>; this inserts a hyphen in the buffer to
indicate that it has done its work.  Then insert the abbrev `<samp><span class="samp">cnst</span></samp>';
the buffer now contains `<samp><span class="samp">re-cnst</span></samp>'.  Now insert a non-word character
to expand the abbrev `<samp><span class="samp">cnst</span></samp>' into `<samp><span class="samp">construction</span></samp>'.  This
expansion step also deletes the hyphen that indicated <kbd>M-'</kbd> had been
used.  The result is the desired `<samp><span class="samp">reconstruction</span></samp>'.

   <p>If you actually want the text of the abbrev in the buffer, rather than
its expansion, you can accomplish this by inserting the following
punctuation with <kbd>C-q</kbd>.  Thus, <kbd>foo C-q ,</kbd> leaves `<samp><span class="samp">foo,</span></samp>' in
the buffer, not expanding it.

   <p><a name="index-unexpand_002dabbrev-3202"></a>  If you expand an abbrev by mistake, you can undo the expansion by
typing <kbd>C-/</kbd> (<code>undo</code>).  See <a href="#Undo">Undo</a>.  This undoes the
insertion of the abbrev expansion and brings back the abbrev text.  If
the result you want is the terminating non-word character plus the
unexpanded abbrev, you must reinsert the terminating character,
quoting it with <kbd>C-q</kbd>.  You can also use the command <kbd>M-x
unexpand-abbrev</kbd> to cancel the last expansion without deleting the
terminating character.

   <p><a name="index-expand_002dregion_002dabbrevs-3203"></a>  <kbd>M-x expand-region-abbrevs</kbd> searches through the region for defined
abbrevs, and for each one found offers to replace it with its expansion. 
This command is useful if you have typed in text using abbrevs but forgot
to turn on Abbrev mode first.  It may also be useful together with a
special set of abbrev definitions for making several global replacements at
once.  This command is effective even if Abbrev mode is not enabled.

   <p>The function <code>expand-abbrev</code> performs the expansion by calling
the function that <code>abbrev-expand-function</code> specifies.  By
changing this function you can make arbitrary changes to
the abbrev expansion.  See <a href="elisp.html#Abbrev-Expansion">Abbrev Expansion</a>.

   <p>A line containing a name in parentheses is the header for abbrevs in a
particular abbrev table; <code>global-abbrev-table</code> contains all the global
abbrevs, and the other abbrev tables that are named after major modes
contain the mode-specific abbrevs.

   <p>Within each abbrev table, each nonblank line defines one abbrev.  The
word at the beginning of the line is the abbrev.  The number that
follows is the number of times the abbrev has been expanded.  Emacs
keeps track of this to help you see which abbrevs you actually use, so
that you can eliminate those that you don't use often.  The string at
the end of the line is the expansion.

   <p>Some abbrevs are marked with `<samp><span class="samp">(sys)</span></samp>'.  These <dfn>system abbrevs</dfn>
(see <a href="elisp.html#Abbrevs">Abbrevs</a>) are
pre-defined by various modes, and are not saved to your abbrev file. 
To disable a system abbrev, define an abbrev of the same name that
expands to itself, and save it to your abbrev file.

   <p><a name="index-write_002dabbrev_002dfile-3207"></a>  <kbd>M-x write-abbrev-file</kbd> reads a file name using the minibuffer and
then writes a description of all current abbrev definitions into that
file.  This is used to save abbrev definitions for use in a later
session.  The text stored in the file is a series of Lisp expressions
that, when executed, define the same abbrevs that you currently have.

   <p><a name="index-read_002dabbrev_002dfile-3208"></a><a name="index-quietly_002dread_002dabbrev_002dfile-3209"></a><a name="index-abbrev_002dfile_002dname-3210"></a><a name="index-abbrev-file-3211"></a>  <kbd>M-x read-abbrev-file</kbd> reads a file name using the minibuffer
and then reads the file, defining abbrevs according to the contents of
the file.  The function <code>quietly-read-abbrev-file</code> is similar
except that it does not display a message in the echo area; you cannot
invoke it interactively, and it is used primarily in your init file
(see <a href="#Init-File">Init File</a>).  If either of these functions is called with
<code>nil</code> as the argument, it uses the file given by the variable
<code>abbrev-file-name</code>, which is <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs.d/abbrev_defs</span></samp> by
default.  This is your standard abbrev definition file, and Emacs
loads abbrevs from it automatically when it starts up.  (As an
exception, Emacs does not load the abbrev file when it is started in
batch mode.  See <a href="#Initial-Options">Initial Options</a>, for a description of batch mode.)

   <p><a name="index-save_002dabbrevs-3212"></a>  Emacs will offer to save abbrevs automatically if you have changed
any of them, whenever it offers to save all files (for <kbd>C-x s</kbd> or
<kbd>C-x C-c</kbd>).  It saves them in the file specified by
<code>abbrev-file-name</code>.  This feature can be inhibited by setting the

similar to the previous commands but work on text in an Emacs buffer. 
<kbd>M-x insert-abbrevs</kbd> inserts text into the current buffer after point,
describing all current abbrev definitions; <kbd>M-x define-abbrevs</kbd> parses
the entire current buffer and defines abbrevs accordingly.

<h3 class="section">29.6 Dynamic Abbrev Expansion</h3>

<p>The abbrev facility described above operates automatically as you
insert text, but all abbrevs must be defined explicitly.  By contrast,
<dfn>dynamic abbrevs</dfn> allow the meanings of abbreviations to be
determined automatically from the contents of the buffer, but dynamic
abbrev expansion happens only when you request it explicitly.

   <p><a name="index-M_002d_002f-3215"></a><a name="index-C_002dM_002d_002f-3216"></a><a name="index-dabbrev_002dexpand-3217"></a><a name="index-dabbrev_002dcompletion-3218"></a>

(<code>dabbrev-expand</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-M-/</kbd><dd>Complete the word before point as a dynamic abbrev
(<code>dabbrev-completion</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-dabbrev_002dlimit-3219"></a>  For example, if the buffer contains `<samp><span class="samp">does this follow </span></samp>' and you
type <kbd>f o M-/</kbd>, the effect is to insert `<samp><span class="samp">follow</span></samp>' because that
is the last word in the buffer that starts with `<samp><span class="samp">fo</span></samp>'.  A numeric
argument to <kbd>M-/</kbd> says to take the second, third, etc. distinct
expansion found looking backward from point.  Repeating <kbd>M-/</kbd>
searches for an alternative expansion by looking farther back.  After
scanning all the text before point, it searches the text after point. 
The variable <code>dabbrev-limit</code>, if non-<code>nil</code>, specifies how far
away in the buffer to search for an expansion.

   <p><a name="index-dabbrev_002dcheck_002dall_002dbuffers-3220"></a>  After scanning the current buffer, <kbd>M-/</kbd> normally searches other
buffers, unless you have set <code>dabbrev-check-all-buffers</code> to
<code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-dabbrev_002dignored_002dbuffer_002dregexps-3221"></a>  For finer control over which buffers to scan, customize the variable
<code>dabbrev-ignored-buffer-regexps</code>.  Its value is a list of regular
expressions.  If a buffer's name matches any of these regular
expressions, dynamic abbrev expansion skips that buffer.

   <p>A negative argument to <kbd>M-/</kbd>, as in <kbd>C-u - M-/</kbd>, says to
search first for expansions after point, then other buffers, and
consider expansions before point only as a last resort.  If you repeat
the <kbd>M-/</kbd> to look for another expansion, do not specify an
argument.  Repeating <kbd>M-/</kbd> cycles through all the expansions after
point and then the expansions before point.

   <p>After you have expanded a dynamic abbrev, you can copy additional
words that follow the expansion in its original context.  Simply type
<kbd>&lt;SPC&gt; M-/</kbd> for each additional word you want to copy.  The
spacing and punctuation between words is copied along with the words.

   <p>The command <kbd>C-M-/</kbd> (<code>dabbrev-completion</code>) performs
completion of a dynamic abbrev.  Instead of trying the possible
expansions one by one, it finds all of them, then inserts the text
that they have in common.  If they have nothing in common, <kbd>C-M-/</kbd>
displays a list of completions, from which you can select a choice in
the usual manner.  See <a href="#Completion">Completion</a>.

   <p>Dynamic abbrev expansion is completely independent of Abbrev mode; the
expansion of a word with <kbd>M-/</kbd> is completely independent of whether
it has a definition as an ordinary abbrev.

<h3 class="section">29.7 Customizing Dynamic Abbreviation</h3>

<p>Normally, dynamic abbrev expansion ignores case when searching for
expansions.  That is, the expansion need not agree in case with the word
you are expanding.

   <p><a name="index-dabbrev_002dcase_002dfold_002dsearch-3222"></a>  This feature is controlled by the variable
<code>dabbrev-case-fold-search</code>.  If it is <code>t</code>, case is ignored
in this search; if it is <code>nil</code>, the word and the expansion must
match in case.  If the value is <code>case-fold-search</code> (the default),
then the variable <code>case-fold-search</code> controls whether to ignore
case while searching for expansions (see <a href="#Lax-Search">Lax Search</a>).

   <p><a name="index-dabbrev_002dcase_002dreplace-3223"></a>  Normally, dynamic abbrev expansion preserves the case pattern
<em>of the dynamic abbrev you are expanding</em>, by converting the
expansion to that case pattern.

   <p><a name="index-dabbrev_002dcase_002dfold_002dsearch-3224"></a>  The variable <code>dabbrev-case-replace</code> controls whether to
preserve the case pattern of the dynamic abbrev.  If it is <code>t</code>,
the dynamic abbrev's case pattern is preserved in most cases; if it is
<code>nil</code>, the expansion is always copied verbatim.  If the value is
<code>case-replace</code> (the default), then the variable
<code>case-replace</code> controls whether to copy the expansion verbatim
(see <a href="#Replacement-and-Lax-Matches">Replacement and Lax Matches</a>).

   <p>However, if the expansion contains a complex mixed case pattern, and
the dynamic abbrev matches this pattern as far as it goes, then the
expansion is always copied verbatim, regardless of those variables. 
Thus, for example, if the buffer contains
<code>variableWithSillyCasePattern</code>, and you type <kbd>v a M-/</kbd>, it
copies the expansion verbatim including its case pattern.

   <p><a name="index-dabbrev_002dabbrev_002dchar_002dregexp-3225"></a>  The variable <code>dabbrev-abbrev-char-regexp</code>, if non-<code>nil</code>,
controls which characters are considered part of a word, for dynamic expansion
purposes.  The regular expression must match just one character, never
two or more.  The same regular expression also determines which
characters are part of an expansion.  The (default) value <code>nil</code>
has a special meaning: dynamic abbrevs are made of word characters,
but expansions are made of word and symbol characters.

   <p><a name="index-dabbrev_002dabbrev_002dskip_002dleading_002dregexp-3226"></a>  In shell scripts and makefiles, a variable name is sometimes prefixed
with `<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>' and sometimes not.  Major modes for this kind of text can
customize dynamic abbrev expansion to handle optional prefixes by setting
the variable <code>dabbrev-abbrev-skip-leading-regexp</code>.  Its value
should be a regular expression that matches the optional prefix that
dynamic abbrev expression should ignore.  The default is <code>nil</code>,
which means no characters should be skipped.

  Dired makes an Emacs buffer containing a listing of a directory, and
optionally some of its subdirectories as well.  You can use the normal
Emacs commands to move around in this buffer, and special Dired
commands to operate on the listed files.

   <p>The Dired buffer is read-only, and inserting text in it is not
allowed.  Ordinary printing characters such as <kbd>d</kbd> and <kbd>x</kbd> are
redefined for special Dired commands.  Some Dired commands <dfn>mark</dfn>
or <dfn>flag</dfn> the <dfn>current file</dfn> (that is, the file on the current
line); other commands operate on the marked files or on the flagged
files.  You first mark certain files in order to operate on all of
them with one command.

   <p>The Dired-X package provides various extra features for Dired mode. 
See <a href="dired-x.html#Top">Dired-X</a>.

   <p>You can also view a list of files in a directory with <kbd>C-x C-d</kbd>
(<code>list-directory</code>).  Unlike Dired, this command does not allow
you to operate on the listed files.  See <a href="#Directories">Directories</a>.

<p><a name="index-dired-3229"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-d-3230"></a><a name="index-dired_002dlisting_002dswitches-3231"></a>  To invoke Dired, type <kbd>C-x d</kbd> (<code>dired</code>).  This reads a
directory name using the minibuffer, and opens a <dfn>Dired buffer</dfn>
listing the files in that directory.  You can also supply a wildcard
file name pattern as the minibuffer argument, in which case the Dired
buffer lists all files matching that pattern.  The usual history and
completion commands can be used in the minibuffer; in particular,
<kbd>M-n</kbd> puts the name of the visited file (if any) in the minibuffer
(see <a href="#Minibuffer-History">Minibuffer History</a>).

   <p>You can also invoke Dired by giving <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> (<code>find-file</code>)
a directory name.

   <p>The variable <code>dired-listing-switches</code> specifies the options to
give to <samp><span class="command">ls</span></samp> for listing the directory; this string
<em>must</em> contain `<samp><span class="samp">-l</span></samp>'.  If you use a prefix argument with the
<code>dired</code> command, you can specify the <samp><span class="command">ls</span></samp> switches with the
minibuffer before you enter the directory specification.  No matter
how they are specified, the <samp><span class="command">ls</span></samp> switches can include short
options (that is, single characters) requiring no arguments, and long
options (starting with `<samp><span class="samp">--</span></samp>') whose arguments are specified with
`<samp><span class="samp">=</span></samp>'.

   <p><a name="index-dired_002duse_002dls_002ddired-3232"></a>  If your <samp><span class="command">ls</span></samp> program supports the `<samp><span class="samp">--dired</span></samp>' option,
Dired automatically passes it that option; this causes <samp><span class="command">ls</span></samp> to
emit special escape sequences for certain unusual file names, without
which Dired will not be able to parse those names.  The first time you
run Dired in an Emacs session, it checks whether <samp><span class="command">ls</span></samp> supports
the `<samp><span class="samp">--dired</span></samp>' option by calling it once with that option.  If the
exit code is 0, Dired will subsequently use the `<samp><span class="samp">--dired</span></samp>' option;
otherwise it will not.  You can inhibit this check by customizing the
variable <code>dired-use-ls-dired</code>.  The value <code>unspecified</code> (the
default) means to perform the check; any other non-<code>nil</code> value
means to use the `<samp><span class="samp">--dired</span></samp>' option; and <code>nil</code> means not to
use the `<samp><span class="samp">--dired</span></samp>' option.

   <p>On MS-Windows and MS-DOS systems, Emacs emulates <samp><span class="command">ls</span></samp>. 
See <a href="#ls-in-Lisp">ls in Lisp</a>, for options and peculiarities of this emulation.

(<code>dired-other-window</code>).  <kbd>C-x 5 d</kbd>
(<code>dired-other-frame</code>) displays the Dired buffer in a separate
frame.

deletes its window if the window was created just for that buffer.

buffers.  The keys <kbd>C-n</kbd> and <kbd>C-p</kbd> are redefined to put the
cursor at the beginning of the file name on the line, rather than at
the beginning of the line.

   <p><a name="index-SPC-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-3241"></a>  For extra convenience, &lt;SPC&gt; and <kbd>n</kbd> in Dired are equivalent
to <kbd>C-n</kbd>.  <kbd>p</kbd> is equivalent to <kbd>C-p</kbd>.  (Moving by lines
is so common in Dired that it deserves to be easy to type.)  &lt;DEL&gt;
(move up and unflag) is also often useful simply for moving up
(see <a href="#Dired-Deletion">Dired Deletion</a>).

   <p><a name="index-dired_002dgoto_002dfile-3242"></a><a name="index-j-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-3243"></a>  <kbd>j</kbd> (<code>dired-goto-file</code>) prompts for a file name using the
minibuffer, and moves point to the line in the Dired buffer describing
that file.

incremental search in the Dired buffer, looking for matches only
amongst the file names and ignoring the rest of the text in the
buffer.  <kbd>M-s f M-C-s</kbd> (<code>dired-isearch-filenames-regexp</code>)
does the same, using a regular expression search.  If you change the
variable <code>dired-isearch-filenames</code> to <code>t</code>, then the
usual search commands also limit themselves to the file names; for
instance, <kbd>C-s</kbd> behaves like <kbd>M-s f C-s</kbd>.  If the value is
<code>dwim</code>, then search commands match the file names only when point
was on a file name initially.  See <a href="#Search">Search</a>, for information about
incremental search.

   <p>Some additional navigation commands are available when the Dired
buffer includes several directories.  See <a href="#Subdirectory-Motion">Subdirectory Motion</a>.

<h3 class="section">30.3 Deleting Files with Dired</h3>

  One of the most frequent uses of Dired is to first <dfn>flag</dfn> files for
deletion, then delete the files that were flagged.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>d</kbd><dd>Flag this file for deletion (<code>dired-flag-file-deletion</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>u</kbd><dd>Remove the deletion flag (<code>dired-unmark</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd><dd>Move point to previous line and remove the deletion flag on that line
(<code>dired-unmark-backward</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>x</kbd><dd>Delete files flagged for deletion (<code>dired-do-flagged-delete</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-d-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-3252"></a><a name="index-dired_002dflag_002dfile_002ddeletion-3253"></a>  You can flag a file for deletion by moving to the line describing
the file and typing <kbd>d</kbd> (<code>dired-flag-file-deletion</code>).  The
deletion flag is visible as a `<samp><span class="samp">D</span></samp>' at the beginning of the line. 
This command moves point to the next line, so that repeated <kbd>d</kbd>
commands flag successive files.  A numeric prefix argument serves as a
repeat count; a negative count means to flag preceding files.

   <p>If the region is active, the <kbd>d</kbd> command flags all files in the
region for deletion; in this case, the command does not move point,
and ignores any prefix argument.

   <p><a name="index-u-_0040r_007b_0028Dired-deletion_0029_007d-3254"></a><a name="index-DEL-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-3255"></a>  The reason for flagging files for deletion, rather than deleting
files immediately, is to reduce the danger of deleting a file
accidentally.  Until you direct Dired to delete the flagged files, you
can remove deletion flags using the commands <kbd>u</kbd> and &lt;DEL&gt;. 
<kbd>u</kbd> (<code>dired-unmark</code>) works just like <kbd>d</kbd>, but removes
flags rather than making flags.  &lt;DEL&gt;
(<code>dired-unmark-backward</code>) moves upward, removing flags; it is
like <kbd>u</kbd> with argument &minus;1.  A numeric prefix argument to
either command serves as a repeat count, with a negative count meaning
to unflag in the opposite direction.  If the region is active, these
commands instead unflag all files in the region, without moving point.

   <p><a name="index-x-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-3256"></a><a name="index-dired_002ddo_002dflagged_002ddelete-3257"></a>  To delete flagged files, type <kbd>x</kbd>
(<code>dired-do-flagged-delete</code>).  This command displays a list of all
the file names flagged for deletion, and requests confirmation with
<kbd>yes</kbd>.  If you confirm, Dired deletes the flagged files, then
deletes their lines from the text of the Dired buffer.  The Dired
buffer, with somewhat fewer lines, remains selected.

   <p>If you answer <kbd>no</kbd> or quit with <kbd>C-g</kbd> when asked to confirm, you
return immediately to Dired, with the deletion flags still present in
the buffer, and no files actually deleted.

   <p><a name="index-recursive-deletion-3258"></a><a name="index-dired_002drecursive_002ddeletes-3259"></a>  You can delete empty directories just like other files, but normally
Dired cannot delete directories that are nonempty.  If the variable
<code>dired-recursive-deletes</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, then Dired can
delete nonempty directories including all their contents.  That can
be somewhat risky.

   <p><a name="index-delete_002dby_002dmoving_002dto_002dtrash-3260"></a>  If you change the variable <code>delete-by-moving-to-trash</code> to
<code>t</code>, the above deletion commands will move the affected files or
directories into the operating system's Trash, instead of deleting
them outright.  See <a href="#Misc-File-Ops">Misc File Ops</a>.

the backup files for deletion: all but the oldest few and newest few
backups of any one file.  Normally, the number of newest versions kept
for each file is given by the variable <code>dired-kept-versions</code>
(<em>not</em> <code>kept-new-versions</code>; that applies only when saving). 
The number of oldest versions to keep is given by the variable
<code>kept-old-versions</code>.

   <p>Period with a positive numeric argument, as in <kbd>C-u 3 .</kbd>,
specifies the number of newest versions to keep, overriding

<h3 class="section">30.6 Dired Marks vs. Flags</h3>

<p><a name="index-marking-many-files-_0028in-Dired_0029-3289"></a>  Instead of flagging a file with `<samp><span class="samp">D</span></samp>', you can <dfn>mark</dfn> the
file with some other character (usually `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>').  Most Dired
commands to operate on files use the files marked with `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>'.  The
only command that operates on flagged files is <kbd>x</kbd>, which deletes
them.

   <p>Here are some commands for marking with `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>', for unmarking, and
for operating on marks.  (See <a href="#Dired-Deletion">Dired Deletion</a>, for commands to flag

This command is the primary way to create or use marks other than
`<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">D</span></samp>'.  The arguments are single characters&mdash;do not use
&lt;RET&gt; to terminate them.

     <p>You can use almost any character as a mark character by means of this
command, to distinguish various classes of files.  If <var>old-markchar</var>
is a space (`<samp> </samp>'), then the command operates on all unmarked files;
if <var>new-markchar</var> is a space, then the command unmarks the files it
acts on.

     <p>To illustrate the power of this command, here is how to put `<samp><span class="samp">D</span></samp>'
flags on all the files that have no marks, while unflagging all those
that already have `<samp><span class="samp">D</span></samp>' flags:

     <pre class="example">          * c D t  * c &lt;SPC&gt; D  * c t &lt;SPC&gt;
     </pre>
     <p>This assumes that no files were already marked with `<samp><span class="samp">t</span></samp>'.

with `<samp><span class="samp">D</span></samp>'.

     <p>Only the non-directory part of the file name is used in matching.  Use
`<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>' to anchor matches.  You can exclude

<kbd>% m</kbd>, except that it searches the file contents instead of the file
name.  Note that if a file is visited in an Emacs buffer, this command
will look in the buffer without revisiting the file, so the results
might be inconsistent with the file on disk if its contents has changed
since it was last visited.  If you don't want this, you may wish
reverting the files you have visited in your buffers, or turning on
the <code>auto-revert</code> mode in those buffers, before invoking this
command.  See <a href="#Reverting">Reverting</a>.

     <p>In some cases, using this after commands that operate on files can
cause trouble.  For example, after renaming one or more files,
<code>dired-undo</code> restores the original names in the Dired buffer,
which gets the Dired buffer out of sync with the actual contents of
the directory.

<h3 class="section">30.7 Operating on Files</h3>

<p><a name="index-operating-on-files-in-Dired-3336"></a>
  This section describes the basic Dired commands to operate on one file
or several files.  All of these commands are capital letters; all of
them use the minibuffer, either to read an argument or to ask for
confirmation, before they act.  All of them let you specify the
files to manipulate in these ways:

     <ul>
<li>If you give the command a numeric prefix argument <var>n</var>, it operates
on the next <var>n</var> files, starting with the current file.  (If <var>n</var>
is negative, the command operates on the &minus;<var>n</var> files preceding
the current line.)

     <li>Otherwise, if some files are marked with `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>', the command operates
on all those files.

     <li>Otherwise, the command operates on the current file only. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">Certain other Dired commands, such as <kbd>!</kbd> and the `<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>'
commands, use the same conventions to decide which files to work on.

   <p><a name="index-dired_002ddwim_002dtarget-3337"></a><a name="index-two-directories-_0028in-Dired_0029-3338"></a>  Commands which ask for a destination directory, such as those which
copy and rename files or create links for them, try to guess the default
target directory for the operation.  Normally, they suggest the Dired
buffer's default directory, but if the variable <code>dired-dwim-target</code>
is non-<code>nil</code>, and if there is another Dired buffer displayed in the
next window, that other buffer's directory is suggested instead.

   <p>Here are the file-manipulating Dired commands that operate on files.

<a name="index-C-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-3340"></a>
<a name="index-copying-files-_0028in-Dired_0029-3341"></a>
<dl><dt><kbd>C </kbd><var>new</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Copy the specified files (<code>dired-do-copy</code>).  The argument <var>new</var>
is the directory to copy into, or (if copying a single file) the new
name.  This is like the shell command <code>cp</code>.

     <p><a name="index-dired_002dcopy_002dpreserve_002dtime-3342"></a>If <code>dired-copy-preserve-time</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, then copying
with this command preserves the modification time of the old file in
the copy, like `<samp><span class="samp">cp -p</span></samp>'.

     <p><a name="index-dired_002drecursive_002dcopies-3343"></a><a name="index-recursive-copying-3344"></a>The variable <code>dired-recursive-copies</code> controls whether to copy
directories recursively (like `<samp><span class="samp">cp -r</span></samp>').  The default is
<code>top</code>, which means to ask before recursively copying a directory.

     <br><dt><kbd>D</kbd><dd><a name="index-dired_002ddo_002ddelete-3345"></a><a name="index-D-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-3346"></a>Delete the specified files (<code>dired-do-delete</code>).  This is like the
shell command <code>rm</code>.

     <p>Like the other commands in this section, this command operates on the
<em>marked</em> files, or the next <var>n</var> files.  By contrast, <kbd>x</kbd>
(<code>dired-do-flagged-delete</code>) deletes all <dfn>flagged</dfn> files.

     <p><a name="index-dired_002ddo_002drename-3347"></a><a name="index-R-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-3348"></a><a name="index-renaming-files-_0028in-Dired_0029-3349"></a><a name="index-moving-files-_0028in-Dired_0029-3350"></a><br><dt><kbd>R </kbd><var>new</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Rename the specified files (<code>dired-do-rename</code>).  If you rename a
single file, the argument <var>new</var> is the new name of the file.  If
you rename several files, the argument <var>new</var> is the directory into
which to move the files (this is like the shell command <samp><span class="command">mv</span></samp>).

     <p>Dired automatically changes the visited file name of buffers associated
with renamed files so that they refer to the new names.

This is like the shell command <samp><span class="command">ln</span></samp>.  The argument <var>new</var> is
the directory to make the links in, or (if making just one link) the
name to give the link.

     <p><a name="index-dired_002ddo_002dsymlink-3354"></a><a name="index-S-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-3355"></a><a name="index-symbolic-links-_0028creation-in-Dired_0029-3356"></a><br><dt><kbd>S </kbd><var>new</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Make symbolic links to the specified files (<code>dired-do-symlink</code>). 
This is like `<samp><span class="samp">ln -s</span></samp>'.  The argument <var>new</var> is the directory to
make the links in, or (if making just one link) the name to give the
link.

shell command string in the minibuffer, and runs that shell command on
one or more files.  The files that the shell command operates on are
determined in the usual way for Dired commands (see <a href="#Operating-on-Files">Operating on Files</a>).  The command <kbd>X</kbd> is a synonym for <kbd>!</kbd>.

   <p>The command <kbd>&amp;</kbd> (<code>dired-do-async-shell-command</code>) does the
same, except that it runs the shell command asynchronously.  (You can
also do this with <kbd>!</kbd>, by appending a `<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>' character to the
end of the shell command.)  When the command operates on more than one
file, it runs multiple parallel copies of the specified shell command,
one for each file.  As an exception, if the specified shell command
ends in `<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">;&amp;</span></samp>', the shell command is run in the
background on each file sequentially; Emacs waits for each invoked
shell command to terminate before running the next one.

   <p>For both <kbd>!</kbd> and <kbd>&amp;</kbd>, the working directory for the shell
command is the top-level directory of the Dired buffer.

   <p>If you tell <kbd>!</kbd> or <kbd>&amp;</kbd> to operate on more than one file, the
shell command string determines how those files are passed to the
shell command:

     <ul>
<li>If you use `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' surrounded by whitespace in the command string,
then the command runs just once, with the list of file names
substituted for the `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>'.  The order of file names is the order of
appearance in the Dired buffer.

     <p>Thus, <kbd>! tar cf foo.tar * &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> runs <code>tar</code> on the entire
list of file names, putting them into one tar file <samp><span class="file">foo.tar</span></samp>.

     <p>If you want to use `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' as a shell wildcard with whitespace around
it, write `<samp><span class="samp">*""</span></samp>'.  In the shell, this is equivalent to `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>';
but since the `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' is not surrounded by whitespace, Dired does not
treat it specially.

     <li>Otherwise, if the command string contains `<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>' surrounded by
whitespace, Emacs runs the shell command once <em>for each file</em>,
substituting the current file name for `<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>' each time.  You can
use `<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>' more than once in the command; the same file name
replaces each occurrence.

     <li>If the command string contains neither `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' nor `<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>', Emacs
runs the shell command once for each file, adding the file name at the
end.  For example, <kbd>! uudecode &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> runs <code>uudecode</code> on
each file. 
</ul>

   <p>To iterate over the file names in a more complicated fashion, use an
explicit shell loop.  For example, here is how to uuencode each file,
making the output file name by appending `<samp><span class="samp">.uu</span></samp>' to the input file
name:

<pre class="example">     for file in * ; do uuencode "$file" "$file" &gt;"$file".uu; done
</pre>
   <p>The <kbd>!</kbd> and <kbd>&amp;</kbd> commands do not attempt to update the Dired
buffer to show new or modified files, because they don't know what
files will be changed.  Use the <kbd>g</kbd> command to update the Dired
buffer (see <a href="#Dired-Updating">Dired Updating</a>).

   <p>See <a href="#Single-Shell">Single Shell</a>, for information about running shell commands
outside Dired.

<h3 class="section">30.9 Transforming File Names in Dired</h3>

<p>This section describes Dired commands which alter file names in a
systematic way.  Each command operates on some or all of the marked
files, using a new name made by transforming the existing name.

   <p>Like the basic Dired file-manipulation commands (see <a href="#Operating-on-Files">Operating on Files</a>), the commands described here operate either on the next
<var>n</var> files, or on all files marked with `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>', or on the current
file.  (To mark files, use the commands described in <a href="#Marks-vs-Flags">Marks vs Flags</a>.)

   <p>All of the commands described in this section work
<em>interactively</em>: they ask you to confirm the operation for each
candidate file.  Thus, you can select more files than you actually
need to operate on (e.g., with a regexp that matches many files), and
then filter the selected names by typing <kbd>y</kbd> or <kbd>n</kbd> when the
command prompts for confirmation.

in each case computing the new name by regular-expression substitution
from the name of the old file. 
</dl>

   <p>The four regular-expression substitution commands effectively
perform a search-and-replace on the selected file names.  They read
two arguments: a regular expression <var>from</var>, and a substitution
pattern <var>to</var>; they match each old file name against
<var>from</var>, and then replace the matching part with <var>to</var>.  You can
use `<samp><span class="samp">\&amp;</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">\</span><var>digit</var></samp>' in <var>to</var> to refer to all or
part of what the pattern matched in the old file name, as in
<code>replace-regexp</code> (see <a href="#Regexp-Replace">Regexp Replace</a>).  If the regular
expression matches more than once in a file name, only the first match
is replaced.

   <p>For example, <kbd>% R ^.*$ &lt;RET&gt; x-\&amp; &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> renames each
selected file by prepending `<samp><span class="samp">x-</span></samp>' to its name.  The inverse of this,
removing `<samp><span class="samp">x-</span></samp>' from the front of each file name, is also possible:
one method is <kbd>% R ^x-\(.*\)$ &lt;RET&gt; \1 &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>; another is
<kbd>% R ^x- &lt;RET&gt; &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.  (Use `<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>' to anchor
matches that should span the whole file name.)

   <p>Normally, the replacement process does not consider the files'
directory names; it operates on the file name within the directory.  If
you specify a numeric argument of zero, then replacement affects the
entire absolute file name including directory name.  (A non-zero
argument specifies the number of files to operate on.)

   <p>You may want to select the set of files to operate on using the same
regexp <var>from</var> that you will use to operate on them.  To do this,
mark those files with <kbd>% m </kbd><var>from</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>, then use the
same regular expression in the command to operate on the files.  To
make this more convenient, the <kbd>%</kbd> commands to operate on files
use the last regular expression specified in any <kbd>%</kbd> command as a
default.

<p><a name="index-subdirectories-in-Dired-3427"></a><a name="index-expanding-subdirectories-in-Dired-3428"></a>
  A Dired buffer usually displays just one directory, but you can
optionally include its subdirectories as well.

   <p>The simplest way to include multiple directories in one Dired buffer is
to specify the options `<samp><span class="samp">-lR</span></samp>' for running <samp><span class="command">ls</span></samp>.  (If you give a
numeric argument when you run Dired, then you can specify these options
in the minibuffer.)  That produces a recursive directory listing showing
all subdirectories at all levels.

   <p>More often, you will want to show only specific subdirectories.  You
can do this with <kbd>i</kbd> (<code>dired-maybe-insert-subdir</code>):

     
<a name="index-dired_002dmaybe_002dinsert_002dsubdir-3429"></a>
<a name="index-i-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-3430"></a>

</dl>

<p class="noindent">If you use this command on a line that describes a file which is a
directory, it inserts the contents of that directory into the same
Dired buffer, and moves there.  Inserted subdirectory contents follow
the top-level directory of the Dired buffer, just as they do in
`<samp><span class="samp">ls -lR</span></samp>' output.

   <p>If the subdirectory's contents are already present in the buffer,
the <kbd>i</kbd> command just moves to it.

   <p>In either case, <kbd>i</kbd> sets the Emacs mark before moving, so
<kbd>C-u C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> returns to your previous position in the Dired
buffer (see <a href="#Setting-Mark">Setting Mark</a>).  You can also use `<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>' to return to
the parent directory in the same Dired buffer (see <a href="#Dired-Visiting">Dired Visiting</a>).

   <p>Use the <kbd>l</kbd> command (<code>dired-do-redisplay</code>) to update the
subdirectory's contents, and use <kbd>C-u k</kbd> on the subdirectory
header line to remove the subdirectory listing (see <a href="#Dired-Updating">Dired Updating</a>).  You can also hide and show inserted subdirectories
(see <a href="#Hiding-Subdirectories">Hiding Subdirectories</a>).

<h3 class="section">30.12 Subdirectory Switches in Dired</h3>

<p>You can insert subdirectories with specified <samp><span class="command">ls</span></samp> switches in
Dired buffers using <kbd>C-u i</kbd>.  You can change the <samp><span class="command">ls</span></samp>
switches of an already inserted subdirectory at point using <kbd>C-u l</kbd>.

   <p>Dired preserves the switches if you revert the buffer.  Deleting a
subdirectory forgets about its switches.

   <p>Using <code>dired-undo</code>
(see <a href="#Marks-vs-Flags">Marks vs Flags</a>)
to reinsert or delete
subdirectories that were inserted with explicit switches can bypass
Dired's machinery for remembering (or forgetting) switches.  Deleting
a subdirectory using <code>dired-undo</code> does not forget its switches. 
When later reinserted using <kbd>i</kbd>, it will be reinserted using its
old switches.  Using <code>dired-undo</code> to reinsert a subdirectory that
was deleted using the regular Dired commands (not <code>dired-undo</code>)
will originally insert it with its old switches.  Reverting the
buffer, however, will relist it using the buffer's default switches. 
If any of this yields problems, you can easily correct the situation
using <kbd>C-u i</kbd> or <kbd>C-u l</kbd>.

   <p>Dired does not remember the <code>R</code> switch.  Inserting a subdirectory
with switches that include the <code>R</code> switch is equivalent to
inserting each of its subdirectories using all remaining switches. 
For instance, updating or killing a subdirectory that was inserted
with the <code>R</code> switch will not update or kill its subdirectories.

   <p>The buffer's default switches do not affect subdirectories that were
inserted using explicitly specified switches.  In particular,
commands such as <kbd>s</kbd> that change the buffer's switches do not
affect such subdirectories.  (They do, however, affect subdirectories
without explicitly assigned switches.)

   <p>You can make Dired forget about all subdirectory switches and relist
all subdirectories with the buffer's default switches using
<kbd>M-x dired-reset-subdir-switches</kbd>.  This also reverts the Dired buffer.

(see <a href="#Pages">Pages</a>).

   <p><a name="index-header-line-_0028Dired_0029-3433"></a><a name="index-directory-header-lines-3434"></a>  The following commands move across, up and down in the tree of

  <dfn>Hiding</dfn> a subdirectory means to make it invisible, except for its

lines (<code>dired-hide-all</code>).  Or, if any subdirectory is currently
hidden, make all subdirectories visible again.  You can use this command
to get an overview in very deep directory trees or to move quickly to
subdirectories far away. 
</dl>

   <p>Ordinary Dired commands never consider files inside a hidden
subdirectory.  For example, the commands to operate on marked files
ignore files in hidden directories even if they are marked.  Thus you
can use hiding to temporarily exclude subdirectories from operations
without having to remove the Dired marks on files in those
subdirectories.

   <p>See <a href="#Subdirectories-in-Dired">Subdirectories in Dired</a>, for how to insert a subdirectory
listing, and see <a href="#Dired-Updating">Dired Updating</a> for how delete it.

<h3 class="section">30.15 Updating the Dired Buffer</h3>

<p><a name="index-updating-Dired-buffer-3453"></a><a name="index-refreshing-displayed-files-3454"></a>
  This section describes commands to update the Dired buffer to reflect
outside (non-Dired) changes in the directories and files, and to delete
part of the Dired buffer.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>g</kbd><dd>Update the entire contents of the Dired buffer (<code>revert-buffer</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>l</kbd><dd>Update the specified files (<code>dired-do-redisplay</code>).  You specify the
files for <kbd>l</kbd> in the same way as for file operations.

     <br><dt><kbd>k</kbd><dd>Delete the specified <em>file lines</em>&mdash;not the files, just the lines
(<code>dired-do-kill-lines</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>s</kbd><dd>Toggle between alphabetical order and date/time order
(<code>dired-sort-toggle-or-edit</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-u s </kbd><var>switches</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Refresh the Dired buffer using <var>switches</var> as
<code>dired-listing-switches</code>. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-g-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-3455"></a><a name="index-revert_002dbuffer-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-3456"></a>  Type <kbd>g</kbd> (<code>revert-buffer</code>) to update the contents of the
Dired buffer, based on changes in the files and directories listed. 
This preserves all marks except for those on files that have vanished. 
Hidden subdirectories are updated but remain hidden.

   <p><a name="index-l-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-3457"></a><a name="index-dired_002ddo_002dredisplay-3458"></a>  To update only some of the files, type <kbd>l</kbd>
(<code>dired-do-redisplay</code>).  Like the Dired file-operating commands,
this command operates on the next <var>n</var> files (or previous
&minus;<var>n</var> files), or on the marked files if any, or on the
current file.  Updating the files means reading their current status,
then updating their lines in the buffer to indicate that status.

   <p>If you use <kbd>l</kbd> on a subdirectory header line, it updates the
contents of the corresponding subdirectory.

   <p><a name="index-dired_002dauto_002drevert_002dbuffer-3459"></a>  If you use <kbd>C-x d</kbd> or some other Dired command to visit a
directory that is already being shown in a Dired buffer, Dired
switches to that buffer but does not update it.  If the buffer is not
up-to-date, Dired displays a warning telling you to type &lt;g&gt; to
update it.  You can also tell Emacs to revert each Dired buffer
automatically when you revisit it, by setting the variable
<code>dired-auto-revert-buffer</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> value.

   <p><a name="index-k-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-3460"></a><a name="index-dired_002ddo_002dkill_002dlines-3461"></a>  To delete <em>file lines</em> from the buffer&mdash;without actually
deleting the files&mdash;type <kbd>k</kbd> (<code>dired-do-kill-lines</code>).  Like
the file-operating commands, this command operates on the next <var>n</var>
files, or on the marked files if any.  However, it does not operate on
the current file, since otherwise mistyping <kbd>k</kbd> could be annoying.

   <p>If you use <kbd>k</kbd> to kill the line for a directory file which you
had inserted in the Dired buffer as a subdirectory
(see <a href="#Subdirectories-in-Dired">Subdirectories in Dired</a>), it removes the subdirectory listing
as well.  Typing <kbd>C-u k</kbd> on the header line for a subdirectory
also removes the subdirectory line from the Dired buffer.

   <p>The <kbd>g</kbd> command brings back any individual lines that you have
killed in this way, but not subdirectories&mdash;you must use <kbd>i</kbd> to
reinsert a subdirectory.

   <p><a name="index-Dired-sorting-3462"></a><a name="index-sorting-Dired-buffer-3463"></a><a name="index-s-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-3464"></a><a name="index-dired_002dsort_002dtoggle_002dor_002dedit-3465"></a>  The files in a Dired buffers are normally listed in alphabetical order
by file names.  Alternatively Dired can sort them by date/time.  The
Dired command <kbd>s</kbd> (<code>dired-sort-toggle-or-edit</code>) switches
between these two sorting modes.  The mode line in a Dired buffer
indicates which way it is currently sorted&mdash;by name, or by date.

   <p><kbd>C-u s </kbd><var>switches</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> lets you specify a new value for
<code>dired-listing-switches</code>.

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bfind_007d-and-Dired-3466"></a>
  You can select a set of files for display in a Dired buffer more
flexibly by using the <samp><span class="command">find</span></samp> utility to choose the files.

   <p><a name="index-find_002dname_002ddired-3467"></a>  To search for files with names matching a wildcard pattern use
<kbd>M-x find-name-dired</kbd>.  It reads arguments <var>directory</var> and
<var>pattern</var>, and chooses all the files in <var>directory</var> or its
subdirectories whose individual names match <var>pattern</var>.

   <p>The files thus chosen are displayed in a Dired buffer, in which the
ordinary Dired commands are available.

   <p><a name="index-find_002dgrep_002ddired-3468"></a>  If you want to test the contents of files, rather than their names,
use <kbd>M-x find-grep-dired</kbd>.  This command reads two minibuffer
arguments, <var>directory</var> and <var>regexp</var>; it chooses all the files
in <var>directory</var> or its subdirectories that contain a match for
<var>regexp</var>.  It works by running the programs <samp><span class="command">find</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp>.  See also <kbd>M-x grep-find</kbd>, in <a href="#Grep-Searching">Grep Searching</a>.  Remember to write the regular expression for
<samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp>, not for Emacs.  (An alternative method of showing
files whose contents match a given regexp is the <kbd>% g
</kbd><var>regexp</var> command, see <a href="#Marks-vs-Flags">Marks vs Flags</a>.)

   <p><a name="index-find_002ddired-3469"></a>  The most general command in this series is <kbd>M-x find-dired</kbd>,
which lets you specify any condition that <samp><span class="command">find</span></samp> can test.  It
takes two minibuffer arguments, <var>directory</var> and <var>find-args</var>;
it runs <samp><span class="command">find</span></samp> in <var>directory</var>, passing <var>find-args</var> to
tell <samp><span class="command">find</span></samp> what condition to test.  To use this command, you
need to know how to use <samp><span class="command">find</span></samp>.

   <p><a name="index-find_002dls_002doption-3470"></a>  The format of listing produced by these commands is controlled by
the variable <code>find-ls-option</code>.  This is a pair of options; the
first specifying how to call <samp><span class="command">find</span></samp> to produce the file listing,
and the second telling Dired to parse the output.

   <p><a name="index-locate-3471"></a><a name="index-locate_002dwith_002dfilter-3472"></a><a name="index-file-database-_0028locate_0029-3473"></a><a name="index-locate_002dcommand-3474"></a>  The command <kbd>M-x locate</kbd> provides a similar interface to the
<samp><span class="command">locate</span></samp> program.  <kbd>M-x locate-with-filter</kbd> is similar, but
keeps only files whose names match a given regular expression.

   <p>These buffers don't work entirely like ordinary Dired buffers: file
operations work, but do not always automatically update the buffer. 
Reverting the buffer with <kbd>g</kbd> deletes all inserted subdirectories,
and erases all flags and marks.

<h3 class="section">30.17 Editing the Dired Buffer</h3>

<p><a name="index-wdired-mode-3475"></a><a name="index-wdired_002dchange_002dto_002dwdired_002dmode-3476"></a>  Wdired is a special mode that allows you to perform file operations
by editing the Dired buffer directly (the &ldquo;W&rdquo; in &ldquo;Wdired&rdquo; stands
for &ldquo;writable&rdquo;).  To enter Wdired mode, type <kbd>C-x C-q</kbd>
(<code>dired-toggle-read-only</code>) while in a Dired buffer. 
Alternatively, use the `<samp><span class="samp">Immediate / Edit File Names</span></samp>' menu item.

   <p><a name="index-wdired_002dfinish_002dedit-3477"></a>  While in Wdired mode, you can rename files by editing the file names
displayed in the Dired buffer.  All the ordinary Emacs editing
commands, including rectangle operations and <code>query-replace</code>, are
available for this.  Once you are done editing, type <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>
(<code>wdired-finish-edit</code>).  This applies your changes and switches
back to ordinary Dired mode.

   <p>Apart from simply renaming files, you can move a file to another
directory by typing in the new file name (either absolute or
relative).  To mark a file for deletion, delete the entire file name. 
To change the target of a symbolic link, edit the link target name
which appears next to the link name.

   <p>The rest of the text in the buffer, such as the file sizes and
modification dates, is marked read-only, so you can't edit it. 
However, if you set <code>wdired-allow-to-change-permissions</code> to
<code>t</code>, you can edit the file permissions.  For example, you can
change `<samp><span class="samp">-rw-r--r--</span></samp>' to `<samp><span class="samp">-rw-rw-rw-</span></samp>' to make a file
world-writable.  These changes also take effect when you type <kbd>C-c
C-c</kbd>.

<h3 class="section">30.18 Viewing Image Thumbnails in Dired</h3>

<p><a name="index-image_002ddired-mode-3478"></a><a name="index-image_002ddired-3479"></a>
  Image-Dired is a facility for browsing image files.  It provides viewing
the images either as thumbnails or in full size, either inside Emacs
or through an external viewer.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dt-d-_0040r_007b_0028Image_002dDired_0029_007d-3480"></a><a name="index-image_002ddired_002ddisplay_002dthumbs-3481"></a>  To enter Image-Dired, mark the image files you want to look at in
the Dired buffer, using <kbd>m</kbd> as usual.  Then type <kbd>C-t d</kbd>
(<code>image-dired-display-thumbs</code>).  This creates and switches to a
buffer containing image-dired, corresponding to the marked files.

   <p>You can also enter Image-Dired directly by typing <kbd>M-x
image-dired</kbd>.  This prompts for a directory; specify one that has
image files.  This creates thumbnails for all the images in that
directory, and displays them all in the thumbnail buffer.  This
takes a long time if the directory contains many image files, and it
asks for confirmation if the number of image files exceeds
<code>image-dired-show-all-from-dir-max-files</code>.

   <p>With point in the thumbnail buffer, you can type &lt;RET&gt;
(<code>image-dired-display-thumbnail-original-image</code>) to display a
sized version of it in another window.  This sizes the image to fit
the window.  Use the arrow keys to move around in the buffer.  For
easy browsing, use &lt;SPC&gt;
(<code>image-dired-display-next-thumbnail-original</code>) to advance and
display the next image.  Typing &lt;DEL&gt;
(<code>image-dired-display-previous-thumbnail-original</code>) backs up to
the previous thumbnail and displays that instead.

   <p><a name="index-image_002ddired_002dexternal_002dviewer-3482"></a>  To view and the image in its original size, either provide a prefix
argument (<kbd>C-u</kbd>) before pressing &lt;RET&gt;, or type
<kbd>C-&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> (<code>image-dired-thumbnail-display-external</code>) to
display the image in an external viewer.  You must first configure
<code>image-dired-external-viewer</code>.

   <p>You can delete images through Image-Dired also.  Type <kbd>d</kbd>
(<code>image-dired-flag-thumb-original-file</code>) to flag the image file
for deletion in the Dired buffer.  You can also delete the thumbnail
image from the thumbnail buffer with <kbd>C-d</kbd>
(<code>image-dired-delete-char</code>).

   <p>More advanced features include <dfn>image tags</dfn>, which are metadata
used to categorize image files.  The tags are stored in a plain text
file configured by <code>image-dired-db-file</code>.

   <p>To tag image files, mark them in the dired buffer (you can also mark
files in Dired from the thumbnail buffer by typing <kbd>m</kbd>) and type
<kbd>C-t t</kbd> (<code>image-dired-tag-files</code>).  This reads the tag name
in the minibuffer.  To mark files having a certain tag, type <kbd>C-t f</kbd>
(<code>image-dired-mark-tagged-files</code>).  After marking image files
with a certain tag, you can use <kbd>C-t d</kbd> to view them.

   <p>You can also tag a file directly from the thumbnail buffer by typing
<kbd>t t</kbd> and you can remove a tag by typing <kbd>t r</kbd>.  There is also
a special tag called &ldquo;comment&rdquo; for each file (it is not a tag in
the exact same sense as the other tags, it is handled slightly
differently).  That is used to enter a comment or description about the
image.  You comment a file from the thumbnail buffer by typing
<kbd>c</kbd>.  You will be prompted for a comment.  Type <kbd>C-t c</kbd> to add
a comment from Dired (<code>image-dired-dired-comment-files</code>).

   <p>Image-Dired also provides simple image manipulation.  In the
thumbnail buffer, type <kbd>L</kbd> to rotate the original image 90 degrees
anti clockwise, and <kbd>R</kbd> to rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.  This
rotation is lossless, and uses an external utility called JpegTRAN.

directory name, and creates that directory.  It signals an error if
the directory already exists.

   <p><a name="index-searching-multiple-files-via-Dired-3485"></a><a name="index-M_002ds-a-C_002ds-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-3486"></a><a name="index-M_002ds-a-M_002dC_002ds-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-3487"></a><a name="index-dired_002ddo_002disearch-3488"></a><a name="index-dired_002ddo_002disearch_002dregexp-3489"></a>  The command <kbd>M-s a C-s</kbd> (<code>dired-do-isearch</code>) begins a
multi-file incremental search on the marked files.  If a search
fails at the end of a file, typing <kbd>C-s</kbd> advances to the next
marked file and repeats the search; at the end of the last marked
file, the search wraps around to the first marked file.  The command
<kbd>M-s a M-C-s</kbd> (<code>dired-do-isearch-regexp</code>) does the same with
a regular expression search.  See <a href="#Repeat-Isearch">Repeat Isearch</a>, for information
about search repetition.

   <p><a name="index-adding-to-the-kill-ring-in-Dired-3490"></a><a name="index-w-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-3491"></a><a name="index-dired_002dcopy_002dfilename_002das_002dkill-3492"></a>  The command <kbd>w</kbd> (<code>dired-copy-filename-as-kill</code>) puts the
names of the marked (or next <var>n</var>) files into the kill ring, as if
you had killed them with <kbd>C-w</kbd>.  The names are separated by a
space.

   <p>With a zero prefix argument, this uses the absolute file name of
each marked file.  With just <kbd>C-u</kbd> as the prefix argument, it uses
file names relative to the Dired buffer's default directory.  (This
can still contain slashes if in a subdirectory.)  As a special case,
if point is on a directory headerline, <kbd>w</kbd> gives you the absolute
name of that directory.  Any prefix argument or marked files are
ignored in this case.

   <p>The main purpose of this command is so that you can yank the file
names into arguments for other Emacs commands.  It also displays what
it added to the kill ring, so you can use it to display the list of
currently marked files in the echo area.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0028-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-3493"></a><a name="index-dired_002dhide_002ddetails_002dmode-3494"></a><a name="index-dired_002dhide_002ddetails_002dhide_002dsymlink_002dtargets-3495"></a><a name="index-dired_002dhide_002ddetails_002dhide_002dinformation_002dlines-3496"></a><a name="index-hiding-details-in-Dired-3497"></a>  The command <kbd>(</kbd> (<code>dired-hide-details-mode</code>) toggles whether
details, such as ownership or file permissions, are visible in the
current Dired buffer.  By default, it also hides the targets of
symbolic links, and all lines other than the header line and
file/directory listings.  To change this, customize the options
<code>dired-hide-details-hide-symlink-targets</code> and
<code>dired-hide-details-hide-information-lines</code>, respectively.

   <p><a name="index-Dired-and-version-control-3498"></a>  If the directory you are visiting is under version control
(see <a href="#Version-Control">Version Control</a>), then the normal VC diff and log commands
will operate on the selected files.

   <p><a name="index-dired_002dcompare_002ddirectories-3499"></a>  The command <kbd>M-x dired-compare-directories</kbd> is used to compare
the current Dired buffer with another directory.  It marks all the files
that differ between the two directories.  It puts these marks
in all Dired buffers where these files are listed, which of course includes
the current buffer.

   <p>The default comparison method (used if you type &lt;RET&gt; at the
prompt) is to compare just the file names&mdash;file names differ if
they do not appear in the other directory.  You can specify
more stringent comparisons by entering a Lisp expression, which can
refer to the variables <code>size1</code> and <code>size2</code>, the respective
file sizes; <code>mtime1</code> and <code>mtime2</code>, the last modification
times in seconds, as floating point numbers; and <code>fa1</code> and
<code>fa2</code>, the respective file attribute lists (as returned by the
function <code>file-attributes</code>).  This expression is evaluated for
each pair of like-named files, and files differ if the expression's
value is non-<code>nil</code>.

   <p>For instance, the sequence <code>M-x dired-compare-directories
&lt;RET&gt; (&gt; mtime1 mtime2) &lt;RET&gt;</code> marks files newer in this
directory than in the other, and marks files older in the other
directory than in this one.  It also marks files with no counterpart,
in both directories, as always.

   <p><a name="index-drag-and-drop_002c-Dired-3500"></a>  On the X Window System, Emacs supports the drag and drop
protocol.  You can drag a file object from another program, and drop
it onto a Dired buffer; this either moves, copies, or creates a link
to the file in that directory.  Precisely which action is taken is
determined by the originating program.  Dragging files out of a Dired
buffer is currently not supported.

<p><a name="index-calendar-3501"></a><a name="index-calendar-3502"></a>
  Emacs provides the functions of a desk calendar, with a diary of
planned or past events.  It also has facilities for managing your
appointments, and keeping track of how much time you spend working on
certain projects.

   <p>To enter the calendar, type <kbd>M-x calendar</kbd>; this displays a
three-month calendar centered on the current month, with point on the
current date.  With a numeric argument, as in <kbd>C-u M-x calendar</kbd>, it
prompts you for the month and year to be the center of the three-month
calendar.  The calendar uses its own buffer, whose major mode is
Calendar mode.

   <p><kbd>mouse-3</kbd> in the calendar brings up a menu of operations on a
particular date; <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> brings up a menu of commonly used
calendar features that are independent of any particular date.  To exit
the calendar, type <kbd>q</kbd>.

<ul class="menu">
<li><a accesskey="1" href="#Calendar-Motion">Calendar Motion</a>:      Moving through the calendar; selecting a date.

<h3 class="section">31.1 Movement in the Calendar</h3>

<p><a name="index-moving-inside-the-calendar-3503"></a>  Calendar mode provides commands to move through the calendar in
logical units of time such as days, weeks, months, and years.  If you
move outside the three months originally displayed, the calendar
display scrolls automatically through time to make the selected
date visible.  Moving to a date lets you view its holidays or diary
entries, or convert it to other calendars; moving by long time periods
is also useful simply to scroll the calendar.

<h4 class="subsection">31.1.1 Motion by Standard Lengths of Time</h4>

<p>The commands for movement in the calendar buffer parallel the
commands for movement in text.  You can move forward and backward by
days, weeks, months, and years.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-f</kbd><dd>Move point one day forward (<code>calendar-forward-day</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-b</kbd><dd>Move point one day backward (<code>calendar-backward-day</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-n</kbd><dd>Move point one week forward (<code>calendar-forward-week</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-p</kbd><dd>Move point one week backward (<code>calendar-backward-week</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-}</kbd><dd>Move point one month forward (<code>calendar-forward-month</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-{</kbd><dd>Move point one month backward (<code>calendar-backward-month</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x ]</kbd><dd>Move point one year forward (<code>calendar-forward-year</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x [</kbd><dd>Move point one year backward (<code>calendar-backward-year</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002df-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3504"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dforward_002dday-3505"></a><a name="index-C_002db-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3506"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dbackward_002dday-3507"></a><a name="index-C_002dn-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3508"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dforward_002dweek-3509"></a><a name="index-C_002dp-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3510"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dbackward_002dweek-3511"></a>  The day and week commands are natural analogues of the usual Emacs
commands for moving by characters and by lines.  Just as <kbd>C-n</kbd>
usually moves to the same column in the following line, in Calendar
mode it moves to the same day in the following week.  And <kbd>C-p</kbd>
moves to the same day in the previous week.

   <p>The arrow keys are equivalent to <kbd>C-f</kbd>, <kbd>C-b</kbd>, <kbd>C-n</kbd> and
<kbd>C-p</kbd>, just as they normally are in other modes.

   <p><a name="index-M_002d_0040_007d-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3512"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dforward_002dmonth-3513"></a><a name="index-M_002d_0040_007b-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3514"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dbackward_002dmonth-3515"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-_005d-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3516"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dforward_002dyear-3517"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-_005b-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3518"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dforward_002dyear-3519"></a>  The commands for motion by months and years work like those for
weeks, but move a larger distance.  The month commands <kbd>M-}</kbd> and
<kbd>M-{</kbd> move forward or backward by an entire month.  The year
commands <kbd>C-x ]</kbd> and <kbd>C-x&nbsp;[</kbd><!-- /@w --> move forward or backward a
whole year.

   <p>The easiest way to remember these commands is to consider months and
years analogous to paragraphs and pages of text, respectively.  But
the commands themselves are not quite analogous.  The ordinary Emacs
paragraph commands move to the beginning or end of a paragraph,
whereas these month and year commands move by an entire month or an
entire year, keeping the same date within the month or year.

   <p>All these commands accept a numeric argument as a repeat count. 
For convenience, the digit keys and the minus sign specify numeric
arguments in Calendar mode even without the Meta modifier.  For example,
<kbd>100 C-f</kbd> moves point 100 days forward from its present location.

<h4 class="subsection">31.1.2 Beginning or End of Week, Month or Year</h4>

<p>A week (or month, or year) is not just a quantity of days; we think of
weeks (months, years) as starting on particular dates.  So Calendar mode
provides commands to move to the start or end of a week, month or year:

     
<a name="index-C_002da-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3520"></a>

</dl>

   <p>These commands also take numeric arguments as repeat counts, with the
repeat count indicating how many weeks, months, or years to move
backward or forward.

   <p><a name="index-calendar_002dweek_002dstart_002dday-3532"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dweekend_002ddays-3533"></a><a name="index-weeks_002c-which-day-they-start-on-3534"></a><a name="index-calendar_002c-first-day-of-week-3535"></a>  By default, weeks begin on Sunday.  To make them begin on Monday
instead, set the variable <code>calendar-week-start-day</code> to 1.  To
change which day headers are highlighted as weekend days, set the
variable <code>calendar-weekend-days</code>.

<h4 class="subsection">31.1.3 Specified Dates</h4>

<p>Calendar mode provides commands for moving to a particular date
specified in various ways.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>g d</kbd><dd>Move point to specified date (<code>calendar-goto-date</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>g D</kbd><dd>Move point to specified day of year (<code>calendar-goto-day-of-year</code>).

of the month, and then moves to that date.  Because the calendar includes all
dates from the beginning of the current era, you must type the year in its
entirety; that is, type `<samp><span class="samp">2010</span></samp>', not `<samp><span class="samp">10</span></samp>'.

day number, and moves to that date.  Negative day numbers count
backward from the end of the year.  <kbd>g w</kbd>
(<code>calendar-iso-goto-week</code>) prompts for a year and week number,
and moves to that week.

   <p><a name="index-o-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3542"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dother_002dmonth-3543"></a>  <kbd>o</kbd> (<code>calendar-other-month</code>) prompts for a month and year,

<h3 class="section">31.2 Scrolling in the Calendar</h3>

<p><a name="index-scrolling-in-the-calendar-3546"></a>  The calendar display scrolls automatically through time when you
move out of the visible portion.  You can also scroll it manually. 
Imagine that the calendar window contains a long strip of paper with
the months on it.  Scrolling the calendar means moving the strip
horizontally, so that new months become visible in the window.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>&gt;</kbd><dd>Scroll calendar one month forward (<code>calendar-scroll-left</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>&lt;</kbd><dd>Scroll calendar one month backward (<code>calendar-scroll-right</code>).

<br><dt><kbd>M-v</kbd><dt><kbd>&lt;prior&gt;</kbd><dd>Scroll backward by three months (<code>calendar-scroll-right-three-months</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-g_t_003e-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3547"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dscroll_002dleft-3548"></a><a name="index-g_t_003c-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3549"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dscroll_002dright-3550"></a>  The most basic calendar scroll commands scroll by one month at a
time.  This means that there are two months of overlap between the
display before the command and the display after.  <kbd>&gt;</kbd> scrolls the
calendar contents one month forward in time.  <kbd>&lt;</kbd> scrolls the
contents one month backwards in time.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dv-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3551"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dscroll_002dleft_002dthree_002dmonths-3552"></a><a name="index-M_002dv-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3553"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dscroll_002dright_002dthree_002dmonths-3554"></a>  The commands <kbd>C-v</kbd> and <kbd>M-v</kbd> scroll the calendar by an entire
screenful&mdash;three months&mdash;in analogy with the usual meaning of
these commands.  <kbd>C-v</kbd> makes later dates visible and <kbd>M-v</kbd> makes
earlier dates visible.  These commands take a numeric argument as a
repeat count; in particular, since <kbd>C-u</kbd> multiplies the next command
by four, typing <kbd>C-u C-v</kbd> scrolls the calendar forward by a year and
typing <kbd>C-u M-v</kbd> scrolls the calendar backward by a year.

   <p>The function keys &lt;next&gt; and &lt;prior&gt; are equivalent to
<kbd>C-v</kbd> and <kbd>M-v</kbd>, just as they are in other modes.

the number of days remaining in the year, type the <kbd>p d</kbd> command
(<code>calendar-print-day-of-year</code>).  This displays both of those
numbers in the echo area.  The count of days elapsed includes the
selected date.  The count of days remaining does not include that
date.

non-Calendar-mode editing commands.)

   <p><a name="index-SPC-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3562"></a>  In Calendar mode, you can use &lt;SPC&gt; (<code>scroll-other-window</code>)
and &lt;DEL&gt; (<code>scroll-other-window-down</code>) to scroll the other
window (if there is one) up or down, respectively.  This is handy when
you display a list of holidays or diary entries in another window.

<h3 class="section">31.5 Writing Calendar Files</h3>

<p>You can write calendars and diary entries to HTML and LaTeX files.

   <p><a name="index-calendar-and-HTML-3566"></a>  The Calendar HTML commands produce files of HTML code that contain
calendar, holiday, and diary entries.  Each file applies to one month,
and has a name of the format <samp><var>yyyy</var><span class="file">-</span><var>mm</var><span class="file">.html</span></samp>, where
<var>yyyy</var> and <var>mm</var> are the four-digit year and two-digit month,
respectively.  The variable <code>cal-html-directory</code> specifies the
default output directory for the HTML files.  To prevent holidays
from being shown, customize <code>cal-html-holidays</code>.

   <p><a name="index-cal_002dhtml_002dcss_002ddefault-3567"></a>  Diary entries enclosed by <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> are interpreted as
HTML tags (for example: this is a diary entry with &lt;font
color=&rdquo;red&rdquo;&gt;some red text&lt;/font&gt;).  You can change the overall
appearance of the displayed HTML pages (for example, the color of
various page elements, header styles) via a stylesheet <samp><span class="file">cal.css</span></samp> in
the directory containing the HTML files (see the value of the variable
<code>cal-html-css-default</code> for relevant style settings).

   <p><a name="index-t-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3568"></a>
     <dl>
<dt><kbd>H m</kbd><dd>Generate a one-month calendar (<code>cal-html-cursor-month</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>H y</kbd><dd>Generate a calendar file for each month of a year, as well as an index
page (<code>cal-html-cursor-year</code>).  By default, this command writes
files to a <var>yyyy</var> subdirectory&mdash;if this is altered some hyperlinks
between years will not work. 
</dl>

   <p>If the variable <code>cal-html-print-day-number-flag</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>, then the monthly calendars show the day-of-the-year
number.  The variable <code>cal-html-year-index-cols</code> specifies the
number of columns in the yearly index page.

   <p><a name="index-calendar-and-_0040LaTeX_007b_007d-3569"></a>  The Calendar LaTeX commands produce a buffer of LaTeX code that
prints as a calendar.  Depending on the command you use, the printed
calendar covers the day, week, month or year that point is in.

   <p>Some of these commands print the calendar sideways (in landscape
mode), so it can be wider than it is long.  Some of them use Filofax
paper size (3.75in x 6.75in).  All of these commands accept a prefix
argument, which specifies how many days, weeks, months or years to print
(starting always with the selected one).

   <p>If the variable <code>cal-tex-holidays</code> is non-<code>nil</code> (the default),
then the printed calendars show the holidays in <code>calendar-holidays</code>. 
If the variable <code>cal-tex-diary</code> is non-<code>nil</code> (the default is
<code>nil</code>), diary entries are included also (in monthly, filofax, and
iso-week calendars only).  If the variable <code>cal-tex-rules</code> is
non-<code>nil</code> (the default is <code>nil</code>), the calendar displays ruled
pages in styles that have sufficient room.  Consult the documentation of
the individual cal-tex functions to see which calendars support which
features.

   <p>You can use the variable <code>cal-tex-preamble-extra</code> to insert extra
LaTeX commands in the preamble of the generated document if you need
to.

   <p><a name="index-h-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3572"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dcursor_002dholidays-3573"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dview_002dholidays_002dinitially_002dflag-3574"></a>  To see if any holidays fall on a given date, position point on that
date in the calendar window and use the <kbd>h</kbd> command.  Alternatively,
click on that date with <kbd>mouse-3</kbd> and then choose <kbd>Holidays</kbd>
from the menu that appears.  Either way, this displays the holidays for
that date, in the echo area if they fit there, otherwise in a separate
window.

   <p><a name="index-x-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3575"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dmark_002dholidays-3576"></a><a name="index-u-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3577"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dunmark-3578"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dmark_002dholidays_002dflag-3579"></a>  To view the distribution of holidays for all the dates shown in the
calendar, use the <kbd>x</kbd> command.  This displays the dates that are
holidays in a different face. 
See <a href="#Calendar-Customizing">calendar-holiday-marker</a>. 
  The command applies both to the currently visible months and to
other months that subsequently become visible by scrolling.  To turn
marking off and erase the current marks, type <kbd>u</kbd>, which also
erases any diary marks (see <a href="#Diary">Diary</a>).  If the variable
<code>calendar-mark-holidays-flag</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, creating or
updating the calendar marks holidays automatically.

   <p><a name="index-a-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3580"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dlist_002dholidays-3581"></a>  To get even more detailed information, use the <kbd>a</kbd> command, which
displays a separate buffer containing a list of all holidays in the
current three-month range.  You can use &lt;SPC&gt; and &lt;DEL&gt; in the
calendar window to scroll that list up and down, respectively.

   <p><a name="index-holidays-3582"></a>  The command <kbd>M-x holidays</kbd> displays the list of holidays for the
current month and the preceding and succeeding months; this works even
if you don't have a calendar window.  If the variable
<code>calendar-view-holidays-initially-flag</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, creating
the calendar displays holidays in this way.  If you want the list of
holidays centered around a different month, use <kbd>C-u M-x
holidays</kbd>, which prompts for the month and year.

   <p>The holidays known to Emacs include United States holidays and the
major Bahá'í, Chinese, Christian, Islamic, and Jewish holidays; also the
solstices and equinoxes.

   <p><a name="index-list_002dholidays-3583"></a>   The command <kbd>M-x holiday-list</kbd> displays the list of holidays for
a range of years.  This function asks you for the starting and stopping
years, and allows you to choose all the holidays or one of several
categories of holidays.  You can use this command even if you don't have
a calendar window.

   <p>The dates used by Emacs for holidays are based on <em>current
practice</em>, not historical fact.  For example Veteran's Day began in
1919, but is shown in earlier years.

<h3 class="section">31.7 Times of Sunrise and Sunset</h3>

<p><a name="index-sunrise-and-sunset-3584"></a>
  Special calendar commands can tell you, to within a minute or two, the
times of sunrise and sunset for any date.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>mouse-3 Sunrise/sunset</kbd><dt><kbd>S</kbd><dd>Display times of sunrise and sunset for the selected date
(<code>calendar-sunrise-sunset</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x sunrise-sunset</kbd><dd>Display times of sunrise and sunset for today's date. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-u M-x sunrise-sunset</kbd><dd>Display times of sunrise and sunset for a specified date. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x calendar-sunrise-sunset-month</kbd><dd>Display times of sunrise and sunset for the selected month. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-S-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3585"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dsunrise_002dsunset-3586"></a><a name="index-sunrise_002dsunset-3587"></a>  Within the calendar, to display the <em>local times</em> of sunrise and
sunset in the echo area, move point to the date you want, and type
<kbd>S</kbd>.  Alternatively, click <kbd>mouse-3</kbd> on the date, then choose
`<samp><span class="samp">Sunrise/sunset</span></samp>' from the menu that appears.  The command <kbd>M-x
sunrise-sunset</kbd> is available outside the calendar to display this
information for today's date or a specified date.  To specify a date
other than today, use <kbd>C-u M-x sunrise-sunset</kbd>, which prompts for
the year, month, and day.

   <p>You can display the times of sunrise and sunset for any location and
any date with <kbd>C-u C-u M-x sunrise-sunset</kbd>.  This asks you for a
longitude, latitude, number of minutes difference from Coordinated
Universal Time, and date, and then tells you the times of sunrise and
sunset for that location on that date.

   <p>Because the times of sunrise and sunset depend on the location on
earth, you need to tell Emacs your latitude, longitude, and location
name before using these commands.  Here is an example of what to set:

   <p><a name="index-calendar_002dlocation_002dname-3588"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dlongitude-3589"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dlatitude-3590"></a>
<pre class="example">     (setq calendar-latitude 40.1)
     (setq calendar-longitude -88.2)
     (setq calendar-location-name "Urbana, IL")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Use one decimal place in the values of <code>calendar-latitude</code> and
<code>calendar-longitude</code>.

   <p>Your time zone also affects the local time of sunrise and sunset. 
Emacs usually gets time zone information from the operating system, but
if these values are not what you want (or if the operating system does
not supply them), you must set them yourself.  Here is an example:

   <p><a name="index-calendar_002dtime_002dzone-3591"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dstandard_002dtime_002dzone_002dname-3592"></a><a name="index-calendar_002ddaylight_002dtime_002dzone_002dname-3593"></a>
<pre class="example">     (setq calendar-time-zone -360)
     (setq calendar-standard-time-zone-name "CST")
     (setq calendar-daylight-time-zone-name "CDT")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The value of <code>calendar-time-zone</code> is the number of minutes
difference between your local standard time and Coordinated Universal
Time (Greenwich time).  The values of
<code>calendar-standard-time-zone-name</code> and
<code>calendar-daylight-time-zone-name</code> are the abbreviations used in
your time zone.  Emacs displays the times of sunrise and sunset
<em>corrected for daylight saving time</em>.  See <a href="#Daylight-Saving">Daylight Saving</a>,
for how daylight saving time is determined.

   <p>As a user, you might find it convenient to set the calendar location
variables for your usual physical location in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file. 
If you are a system administrator, you may want to set these variables
for all users in a <samp><span class="file">default.el</span></samp> file.  See <a href="#Init-File">Init File</a>.

buffer of the phases of the moon for the current three-month range.  The
dates and times listed are accurate to within a few minutes.

   <p><a name="index-lunar_002dphases-3598"></a>  Outside the calendar, use the command <kbd>M-x lunar-phases</kbd> to
display the list of the phases of the moon for the current month and the
preceding and succeeding months.  For information about a different
month, use <kbd>C-u M-x lunar-phases</kbd>, which prompts for the month and
year.

   <p>The dates and times given for the phases of the moon are given in
local time (corrected for daylight saving, when appropriate).

<h3 class="section">31.9 Conversion To and From Other Calendars</h3>

<p><a name="index-Gregorian-calendar-3599"></a>  The Emacs calendar displayed is <em>always</em> the Gregorian calendar,
sometimes called the New Style calendar, which is used in most of
the world today.  However, this calendar did not exist before the
sixteenth century and was not widely used before the eighteenth century;
it did not fully displace the Julian calendar and gain universal
acceptance until the early twentieth century.  The Emacs calendar can
display any month since January, year 1 of the current era, but the
calendar displayed is always the Gregorian, even for a date at which
the Gregorian calendar did not exist.

   <p>While Emacs cannot display other calendars, it can convert dates to
and from several other calendars.

<h4 class="subsection">31.9.1 Supported Calendar Systems</h4>

<p><a name="index-ISO-commercial-calendar-3600"></a>  The ISO commercial calendar is often used in business.

   <p><a name="index-Julian-calendar-3601"></a>  The Julian calendar, named after Julius Caesar, was the one used in Europe
throughout medieval times, and in many countries up until the nineteenth
century.

   <p><a name="index-Julian-day-numbers-3602"></a><a name="index-astronomical-day-numbers-3603"></a>  Astronomers use a simple counting of days elapsed since noon, Monday,
January 1, 4713 B.C. on the Julian calendar.  The number of days elapsed
is called the <dfn>Julian day number</dfn> or the <dfn>Astronomical day number</dfn>.

   <p><a name="index-Hebrew-calendar-3604"></a>  The Hebrew calendar is used by tradition in the Jewish religion.  The
Emacs calendar program uses the Hebrew calendar to determine the dates
of Jewish holidays.  Hebrew calendar dates begin and end at sunset.

   <p><a name="index-Islamic-calendar-3605"></a>  The Islamic calendar is used in many predominantly Islamic countries. 
Emacs uses it to determine the dates of Islamic holidays.  There is no
universal agreement in the Islamic world about the calendar; Emacs uses
a widely accepted version, but the precise dates of Islamic holidays
often depend on proclamation by religious authorities, not on
calculations.  As a consequence, the actual dates of observance can vary
slightly from the dates computed by Emacs.  Islamic calendar dates begin
and end at sunset.

   <p><a name="index-French-Revolutionary-calendar-3606"></a>  The French Revolutionary calendar was created by the Jacobins after the 1789
revolution, to represent a more secular and nature-based view of the annual
cycle, and to install a 10-day week in a rationalization measure similar to
the metric system.  The French government officially abandoned this
calendar at the end of 1805.

   <p><a name="index-Mayan-calendar-3607"></a>  The Maya of Central America used three separate, overlapping calendar
systems, the <em>long count</em>, the <em>tzolkin</em>, and the <em>haab</em>. 
Emacs knows about all three of these calendars.  Experts dispute the
exact correlation between the Mayan calendar and our calendar; Emacs uses the
Goodman-Martinez-Thompson correlation in its calculations.

   <p><a name="index-Coptic-calendar-3608"></a><a name="index-Ethiopic-calendar-3609"></a>  The Copts use a calendar based on the ancient Egyptian solar calendar. 
Their calendar consists of twelve 30-day months followed by an extra
five-day period.  Once every fourth year they add a leap day to this
extra period to make it six days.  The Ethiopic calendar is identical in
structure, but has different year numbers and month names.

   <p><a name="index-Persian-calendar-3610"></a>  The Persians use a solar calendar based on a design of Omar Khayyam. 
Their calendar consists of twelve months of which the first six have 31
days, the next five have 30 days, and the last has 29 in ordinary years
and 30 in leap years.  Leap years occur in a complicated pattern every
four or five years. 
The calendar implemented here is the arithmetical Persian calendar
championed by Birashk, based on a 2,820-year cycle.  It differs from
the astronomical Persian calendar, which is based on astronomical
events.  As of this writing the first future discrepancy is projected
to occur on March 20, 2025.  It is currently not clear what the
official calendar of Iran will be at that time. 
<!-- FIXME not so far in the future now. -->

   <p><a name="index-Chinese-calendar-3611"></a>  The Chinese calendar is a complicated system of lunar months arranged
into solar years.  The years go in cycles of sixty, each year containing
either twelve months in an ordinary year or thirteen months in a leap
year; each month has either 29 or 30 days.  Years, ordinary months, and
days are named by combining one of ten <dfn>celestial stems</dfn> with one of
twelve <dfn>terrestrial branches</dfn> for a total of sixty names that are
repeated in a cycle of sixty.

   <p><a name="index-Bah_00c3_00a1_0027_00c3_00ad-calendar-3612"></a>  The Bahá'í calendar system is based on a solar cycle of 19 months with
19 days each.  The four remaining intercalary days are placed
between the 18th and 19th months.

   <p>These commands ask you for a date on the other calendar, move point
to the Gregorian calendar date equivalent to that date, and display
the other calendar's date in the echo area.  Emacs uses strict
completion (see <a href="#Completion-Exit">Completion Exit</a>) whenever it asks you to type a
month name, so you don't have to worry about the spelling of Hebrew,
Islamic, or French names.

<p><a name="index-calendar_002dhebrew_002dlist_002dyahrzeits-3640"></a><a name="index-yahrzeits-3641"></a>  One common issue concerning the Hebrew calendar is the computation
of the anniversary of a date of death, called a <dfn>yahrzeit</dfn>.  The Emacs
calendar includes a facility for such calculations.  If you are in the
calendar, the command <kbd>M-x calendar-hebrew-list-yahrzeits</kbd> asks you for
a range of years and then displays a list of the yahrzeit dates for those
years for the date given by point.  If you are not in the calendar,
this command first asks you for the date of death and the range of
years, and then displays the list of yahrzeit dates.

<h3 class="section">31.10 The Diary</h3>

<p><a name="index-diary-3642"></a>
  The Emacs diary keeps track of appointments or other events on a daily
basis, in conjunction with the calendar.  To use the diary feature, you
must first create a diary file containing a list of events and
their dates.  Then Emacs can automatically pick out and display the
events for today, for the immediate future, or for any specified
date.

   <p>Although you probably will start by creating a diary manually, Emacs
provides a number of commands to let you view, add, and change diary
entries.

<ul class="menu">
<li><a accesskey="1" href="#Format-of-Diary-File">Format of Diary File</a>:    Entering events in your diary. 
<li><a accesskey="2" href="#Displaying-the-Diary">Displaying the Diary</a>:    Viewing diary entries and associated calendar dates.

<h4 class="subsection">31.10.1 The Diary File</h4>

<p><a name="index-diary-file-3643"></a>
<a name="index-diary_002dfile-3644"></a>  Your <dfn>diary file</dfn> is a file that records events associated with
particular dates.  The name of the diary file is specified by the
variable <code>diary-file</code>.  The default is <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs.d/diary</span></samp>,
though for compatibility with older versions Emacs will use
<samp><span class="file">~/diary</span></samp> if it exists.

   <p>Each entry in the diary file describes one event and consists of one
or more lines.  An entry always begins with a date specification at the
left margin.  The rest of the entry is simply text to describe the
event.  If the entry has more than one line, then the lines after the
first must begin with whitespace to indicate they continue a previous
entry.  Lines that do not begin with valid dates and do not continue a
preceding entry are ignored.  Here's an example:

<pre class="example">     12/22/2015  Twentieth wedding anniversary!
     10/22       Ruth's birthday.
     * 21, *:    Payday
     Tuesday--weekly meeting with grad students at 10am
              Supowit, Shen, Bitner, and Kapoor to attend.
     1/13/89     Friday the thirteenth!!
     thu 4pm     squash game with Lloyd.
     mar 16      Dad's birthday
     April 15, 2016 Income tax due.
     * 15        time cards due.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This example uses extra spaces to align the event descriptions of most
of the entries.  Such formatting is purely a matter of taste.

   <p>You can also use a format where the first line of a diary entry
consists only of the date or day name (with no following blanks or
punctuation).  For example:

<pre class="example">     02/11/2012
           Bill B. visits Princeton today
           2pm Cognitive Studies Committee meeting
           2:30-5:30 Liz at Lawrenceville
           4:00pm Dentist appt
           7:30pm Dinner at George's
           8:00-10:00pm concert
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This entry will have a different appearance if you use the simple diary
display
(see <a href="#Diary-Display">Diary Display</a>). 
The simple diary display omits the date line at the beginning; only the
continuation lines appear.  This style of entry looks neater when you
display just a single day's entries, but can cause confusion if you ask
for more than one day's entries.

<h4 class="subsection">31.10.2 Displaying the Diary</h4>

<p>Once you have created a diary file, you can use the calendar to view
it.  You can also view today's events outside of Calendar mode.  In the
following, key bindings refer to the Calendar buffer.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>mouse-3 Diary</kbd><dt><kbd>d</kbd><dd>Display all diary entries for the selected date
(<code>diary-view-entries</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>s</kbd><dd>Display the entire diary file (<code>diary-show-all-entries</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>m</kbd><dd>Mark all visible dates that have diary entries
(<code>diary-mark-entries</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>u</kbd><dd>Unmark the calendar window (<code>calendar-unmark</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x diary-print-entries</kbd><dd>Print hard copy of the diary display as it appears. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x diary</kbd><dd>Display all diary entries for today's date. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x diary-mail-entries</kbd><dd>Mail yourself email reminders about upcoming diary entries. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-d-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3645"></a><a name="index-diary_002dview_002dentries-3646"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dview_002ddiary_002dinitially_002dflag-3647"></a>  Displaying the diary entries with <kbd>d</kbd> shows in a separate buffer
the diary entries for the selected date in the calendar.  The mode line
of the new buffer shows the date of the diary entries.  Holidays are
shown either in the buffer or in the mode line, depending on the display
method you choose
(see <a href="#Diary-Display">Diary Display</a>). 
If you specify a numeric argument with <kbd>d</kbd>, it shows all the diary
entries for that many successive days.  Thus, <kbd>2 d</kbd> displays all the
entries for the selected date and for the following day.

   <p>Another way to display the diary entries for a date is to click
<kbd>mouse-3</kbd> on the date, and then choose <kbd>Diary entries</kbd> from
the menu that appears.  If the variable
<code>calendar-view-diary-initially-flag</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, creating the
calendar lists the diary entries for the current date (provided the
current date is visible).

   <p><a name="index-m-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3648"></a><a name="index-diary_002dmark_002dentries-3649"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dmark_002ddiary_002dentries_002dflag-3650"></a>  To get a broader view of which days are mentioned in the diary, use
the <kbd>m</kbd> command.  This marks the dates that have diary entries in
a different face. 
See <a href="#Calendar-Customizing">diary-entry-marker</a>.

   <p>This command applies both to the months that are currently visible
and to those that subsequently become visible after scrolling.  To turn
marking off and erase the current marks, type <kbd>u</kbd>, which also
turns off holiday marks (see <a href="#Holidays">Holidays</a>).  If the variable
<code>calendar-mark-diary-entries-flag</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, creating or
updating the calendar marks diary dates automatically.

   <p><a name="index-diary_002dnonmarking_002dsymbol-3651"></a>  To prevent an individual diary entry from being marked in the
calendar, insert the string that <code>diary-nonmarking-symbol</code>
specifies (the default is `<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>') at the beginning of the entry,
before the date.  This has no effect on display of the entry in the
diary buffer; it only affects marks on dates in the calendar. 
Nonmarking entries can be useful for generic entries that would
otherwise mark many different dates.

   <p><a name="index-s-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3652"></a><a name="index-diary_002dshow_002dall_002dentries-3653"></a>  To see the full diary file, rather than just some of the entries, use
the <kbd>s</kbd> command.

   <p><a name="index-diary-3654"></a>  The command <kbd>M-x diary</kbd> displays the diary entries for the current
date, independently of the calendar display, and optionally for the next
few days as well; the variable <code>diary-number-of-entries</code> specifies
how many days to include. 
See <a href="#Diary-Customizing">diary-number-of-entries</a>.

   <p>If you put <code>(diary)</code> in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file, this
automatically displays a window with the day's diary entries when you
start Emacs.

   <p><a name="index-diary_002dmail_002dentries-3655"></a><a name="index-diary_002dmail_002ddays-3656"></a>  Some people like to receive email notifications of events in their
diary.  To send such mail to yourself, use the command <kbd>M-x
diary-mail-entries</kbd>.  A prefix argument specifies how many days
(starting with today) to check; otherwise, the variable
<code>diary-mail-days</code> says how many days.

<h4 class="subsection">31.10.3 Date Formats</h4>

<p>Here are some sample diary entries, illustrating different ways of
formatting a date.  The examples all show dates in American order
(month, day, year), but Calendar mode supports European order (day,
month, year) and ISO order (year, month, day) as options.

<pre class="example">     4/20/12  Switch-over to new tabulation system
     apr. 25  Start tabulating annual results
     4/30  Results for April are due
     */25  Monthly cycle finishes
     Friday  Don't leave without backing up files
</pre>
   <p>The first entry appears only once, on April 20, 2012.  The second and
third appear every year on the specified dates, and the fourth uses a
wildcard (asterisk) for the month, so it appears on the 25th of every
month.  The final entry appears every week on Friday.

   <p>You can use just numbers to express a date, as in
`<samp><var>month</var><span class="samp">/</span><var>day</var></samp>' or `<samp><var>month</var><span class="samp">/</span><var>day</var><span class="samp">/</span><var>year</var></samp>'. 
This must be followed by a nondigit.  In the date itself, <var>month</var>
and <var>day</var> are numbers of one or two digits.  The optional <var>year</var>
is also a number, and may be abbreviated to the last two digits; that
is, you can use `<samp><span class="samp">11/12/2012</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">11/12/12</span></samp>'.

   <p>Dates can also have the form `<samp><var>monthname</var> <var>day</var></samp>' or
`<samp><var>monthname</var> <var>day</var><span class="samp">, </span><var>year</var></samp>', where the month's name can
be spelled in full or abbreviated (with or without a period).  The
preferred abbreviations for month and day names can be set using
the variables <code>calendar-abbrev-length</code>,
<code>calendar-month-abbrev-array</code>, and
<code>calendar-day-abbrev-array</code>.  The default is to use the first three
letters of a name as its abbreviation.  Case is not significant.

   <p>A date may be <dfn>generic</dfn>; that is, partially unspecified.  Then the
entry applies to all dates that match the specification.  If the date
does not contain a year, it is generic and applies to any year. 
Alternatively, <var>month</var>, <var>day</var>, or <var>year</var> can be `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>';
this matches any month, day, or year, respectively.  Thus, a diary entry
`<samp><span class="samp">3/*/*</span></samp>' matches any day in March of any year; so does `<samp><span class="samp">march
*</span></samp>'.

   <p><a name="index-calendar_002ddate_002dstyle-3657"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dset_002ddate_002dstyle-3658"></a>  If you prefer the European style of writing dates (in which the day
comes before the month), or the ISO style (in which the order is year,
month, day), type <kbd>M-x calendar-set-date-style</kbd> while in the
calendar, or customize the variable <code>calendar-date-style</code>.  This
affects how diary dates are interpreted, date display, and the order in
which some commands expect their arguments to be given.

   <p>You can use the name of a day of the week as a generic date which
applies to any date falling on that day of the week.  You can abbreviate
the day of the week as described above, or spell it in full; case is not
significant.

<h4 class="subsection">31.10.4 Commands to Add to the Diary</h4>

<p>While in the calendar, there are several commands to create diary
entries.  The basic commands are listed here; more sophisticated
commands are in the next section (see <a href="#Special-Diary-Entries">Special Diary Entries</a>). 
Entries can also be based on non-Gregorian calendars. 
See <a href="#Non_002dGregorian-Diary">Non-Gregorian Diary</a>.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>i d</kbd><dd>Add a diary entry for the selected date (<code>diary-insert-entry</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>i w</kbd><dd>Add a diary entry for the selected day of the week (<code>diary-insert-weekly-entry</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>i m</kbd><dd>Add a diary entry for the selected day of the month (<code>diary-insert-monthly-entry</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>i y</kbd><dd>Add a diary entry for the selected day of the year (<code>diary-insert-yearly-entry</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-i-d-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3659"></a><a name="index-diary_002dinsert_002dentry-3660"></a>  You can make a diary entry for a specific date by selecting that date
in the calendar window and typing the <kbd>i d</kbd> command.  This command
displays the end of your diary file in another window and inserts the
date; you can then type the rest of the diary entry.

   <p><a name="index-i-w-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3661"></a><a name="index-diary_002dinsert_002dweekly_002dentry-3662"></a><a name="index-i-m-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3663"></a><a name="index-diary_002dinsert_002dmonthly_002dentry-3664"></a><a name="index-i-y-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3665"></a><a name="index-diary_002dinsert_002dyearly_002dentry-3666"></a>  If you want to make a diary entry that applies to a specific day of
the week, select that day of the week (any occurrence will do) and type
<kbd>i w</kbd>.  This inserts the day-of-week as a generic date; you can then
type the rest of the diary entry.  You can make a monthly diary entry in
the same fashion: select the day of the month, use the <kbd>i m</kbd>
command, and type the rest of the entry.  Similarly, you can insert a
yearly diary entry with the <kbd>i y</kbd> command.

   <p>All of the above commands make marking diary entries by default.  To
make a nonmarking diary entry, give a prefix argument to the command. 
For example, <kbd>C-u i w</kbd> makes a nonmarking weekly diary entry.

   <p>When you modify the diary file, be sure to save the file before
exiting Emacs.  Saving the diary file after using any of the above
insertion commands will automatically update the diary marks in the
calendar window, if appropriate.  You can use the command
<code>calendar-redraw</code> to force an update at any time.

<h4 class="subsection">31.10.5 Special Diary Entries</h4>

<p>In addition to entries based on calendar dates, the diary file can
contain <dfn>sexp entries</dfn> for regular events such as anniversaries. 
These entries are based on Lisp expressions (sexps) that Emacs evaluates
as it scans the diary file.  Instead of a date, a sexp entry contains
`<samp><span class="samp">%%</span></samp>' followed by a Lisp expression which must begin and end with
parentheses.  The Lisp expression determines which dates the entry
applies to.

   <p>Calendar mode provides commands to insert certain commonly used
sexp entries:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>i a</kbd><dd>Add an anniversary diary entry for the selected date
(<code>diary-insert-anniversary-entry</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>i b</kbd><dd>Add a block diary entry for the current region
(<code>diary-insert-block-entry</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>i c</kbd><dd>Add a cyclic diary entry starting at the date
(<code>diary-insert-cyclic-entry</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-i-a-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3667"></a><a name="index-diary_002dinsert_002danniversary_002dentry-3668"></a>  If you want to make a diary entry that applies to the anniversary of a
specific date, move point to that date and use the <kbd>i a</kbd> command. 
This displays the end of your diary file in another window and inserts
the anniversary description; you can then type the rest of the diary
entry.  The entry looks like this:

   <p><a name="index-diary_002danniversary-3669"></a>
<pre class="example">     %%(diary-anniversary 10 31 1988) Arthur's birthday
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This entry applies to October 31 in any year after 1988; `<samp><span class="samp">10 31
1988</span></samp>' specifies the date.  (If you are using the European or ISO
calendar style, the input order of month, day and year is different.) 
The reason this expression requires a beginning year is that advanced
diary functions can use it to calculate the number of elapsed years.

   <p>A <dfn>block</dfn> diary entry applies to a specified range of consecutive
dates.  Here is a block diary entry that applies to all dates from June
24, 2012 through July 10, 2012:

   <p><a name="index-diary_002dblock-3670"></a>
<pre class="example">     %%(diary-block 6 24 2012 7 10 2012) Vacation
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The `<samp><span class="samp">6 24 2012</span></samp>' indicates the starting date and the `<samp><span class="samp">7 10 2012</span></samp>'
indicates the stopping date.  (Again, if you are using the European or ISO
calendar style, the input order of month, day and year is different.)

   <p><a name="index-i-b-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3671"></a><a name="index-diary_002dinsert_002dblock_002dentry-3672"></a>  To insert a block entry, place point and the mark on the two
dates that begin and end the range, and type <kbd>i b</kbd>.  This command
displays the end of your diary file in another window and inserts the
block description; you can then type the diary entry.

   <p><a name="index-i-c-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3673"></a><a name="index-diary_002dinsert_002dcyclic_002dentry-3674"></a>   <dfn>Cyclic</dfn> diary entries repeat after a fixed interval of days.  To
create one, select the starting date and use the <kbd>i c</kbd> command.  The
command prompts for the length of interval, then inserts the entry,
which looks like this:

   <p><a name="index-diary_002dcyclic-3675"></a>
<pre class="example">     %%(diary-cyclic 50 3 1 2012) Renew medication
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This entry applies to March 1, 2012 and every 50th day following;
`<samp><span class="samp">3 1 2012</span></samp>' specifies the starting date.  (If you are using the
European or ISO calendar style, the input order of month, day and year
is different.)

   <p>All three of these commands make marking diary entries.  To insert a
nonmarking entry, give a prefix argument to the command.  For example,
<kbd>C-u i a</kbd> makes a nonmarking anniversary diary entry.

   <p>Marking sexp diary entries in the calendar can be time-consuming,
since every date visible in the calendar window must be individually
checked.  So it's a good idea to make sexp diary entries nonmarking
(with `<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>') when possible.

   <p>Another sophisticated kind of sexp entry, a <dfn>floating</dfn> diary entry,
specifies a regularly occurring event by offsets specified in days,
weeks, and months.  It is comparable to a crontab entry interpreted by
the <code>cron</code> utility.  Here is a nonmarking, floating diary entry
that applies to the fourth Thursday in November:

   <p><a name="index-diary_002dfloat-3676"></a>
<pre class="example">     &amp;%%(diary-float 11 4 4) American Thanksgiving
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The 11 specifies November (the eleventh month), the 4 specifies Thursday
(the fourth day of the week, where Sunday is numbered zero), and the
second 4 specifies the fourth Thursday (1 would mean &ldquo;first&rdquo;, 2 would
mean &ldquo;second&rdquo;, &minus;2 would mean &ldquo;second-to-last&rdquo;, and so on). 
The month can be a single month or a list of months.  Thus you could change
the 11 above to `<samp><span class="samp">'(1 2 3)</span></samp>' and have the entry apply to the last
Thursday of January, February, and March.  If the month is <code>t</code>, the
entry applies to all months of the year.

   <p>Each of the standard sexp diary entries takes an optional parameter
specifying the name of a face or a single-character string to use when
marking the entry in the calendar.  Most generally, sexp diary entries
can perform arbitrary computations to determine when they apply.

<code>appt-audible</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, the warning includes an audible
reminder.  In addition, if <code>appt-display-mode-line</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>, Emacs displays the number of minutes to the
appointment on the mode line.

   <p><a name="index-appt_002ddisplay_002dduration-3681"></a><a name="index-appt_002ddisp_002dwindow_002dfunction-3682"></a><a name="index-appt_002ddelete_002dwindow_002dfunction-3683"></a>  If <code>appt-display-format</code> has the value <code>window</code>, then the
variable <code>appt-display-duration</code> controls how long the reminder
window is visible for; and the variables
<code>appt-disp-window-function</code> and <code>appt-delete-window-function</code>
give the names of functions used to create and destroy the window,
respectively.

   <p><a name="index-appt_002dactivate-3684"></a>  To enable appointment notification, type <kbd>M-x appt-activate</kbd>. 
With a positive argument, it enables notification; with a negative
argument, it disables notification; with no argument, it toggles. 
Enabling notification also sets up an appointment list for today from
the diary file, giving all diary entries found with recognizable times
of day, and reminds you just before each of them.

   <p>For example, suppose the diary file contains these lines:

<pre class="example">     Monday
       9:30am Coffee break
      12:00pm Lunch
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-appt_002dmessage_002dwarning_002dtime-3685"></a><a name="index-appt_002dwarning_002dtime_002dregexp-3686"></a>Then on Mondays, you will be reminded at around 9:20am about your
coffee break and at around 11:50am about lunch.  The variable
<code>appt-message-warning-time</code> specifies how many minutes (default 12)
in advance to warn you.  This is a default warning time.  Each
appointment can specify a different warning time by adding a piece
matching <code>appt-warning-time-regexp</code> (see that variable's
documentation for details).

   <p>You can write times in am/pm style (with `<samp><span class="samp">12:00am</span></samp>' standing
for midnight and `<samp><span class="samp">12:00pm</span></samp>' standing for noon), or 24-hour
European/military style.  You need not be consistent; your diary file
can have a mixture of the two styles.  Times must be at the beginning of
diary entries if they are to be recognized.

   <p><a name="index-appt_002ddisplay_002ddiary-3687"></a>  Emacs updates the appointments list from the diary file
automatically just after midnight.  You can force an update at any
time by re-enabling appointment notification.  Both these actions also
display the day's diary buffer, unless you set
<code>appt-display-diary</code> to <code>nil</code>.  The appointments list is
also updated whenever the diary file (or a file it includes; see
<a href="#Fancy-Diary-Display">Fancy Diary Display</a>)
is saved.

   <p><a name="index-appt_002dadd-3688"></a><a name="index-appt_002ddelete-3689"></a><a name="index-alarm-clock-3690"></a>  You can also use the appointment notification facility like an alarm
clock.  The command <kbd>M-x appt-add</kbd> adds entries to the appointment
list without affecting your diary file.  You delete entries from the
appointment list with <kbd>M-x appt-delete</kbd>.

<h3 class="section">31.12 Importing and Exporting Diary Entries</h3>

<p>You can transfer diary entries between Emacs diary files and a
variety of other formats.

   <p><a name="index-diary_002doutlook_002dformats-3691"></a>  You can import diary entries from Outlook-generated appointment
messages.  While viewing such a message in Rmail or Gnus, do <kbd>M-x
diary-from-outlook</kbd> to import the entry.  You can make this command
recognize additional appointment message formats by customizing the
variable <code>diary-outlook-formats</code>.  Other mail clients can set
<code>diary-from-outlook-function</code> to an appropriate value.

<!-- FIXME the name of the RFC is hardly very relevant. -->
<p><a name="index-iCalendar-support-3692"></a>  The icalendar package allows you to transfer data between your Emacs
diary file and iCalendar files, which are defined in <cite>RFC
2445&mdash;Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification
(iCalendar)</cite> (as well as the earlier vCalendar format).

<!-- Importing works for ordinary (i.e., non-recurring) events, but -->
<!-- (at present) may not work correctly (if at all) for recurring events. -->
<!-- Exporting of diary files into iCalendar files should work correctly -->
<!-- for most diary entries.  This feature is a work in progress, so the -->
<!-- commands may evolve in future. -->
<p><a name="index-icalendar_002dimport_002dbuffer-3693"></a>  The command <code>icalendar-import-buffer</code> extracts
iCalendar data from the current buffer and adds it to your
diary file.  This function is also suitable for automatic extraction of
iCalendar data; for example with the Rmail mail client one could use:

<pre class="example">     (add-hook 'rmail-show-message-hook 'icalendar-import-buffer)
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-icalendar_002dimport_002dfile-3694"></a>  The command <code>icalendar-import-file</code> imports an iCalendar file
and adds the results to an Emacs diary file.  For example:

<pre class="example">     (icalendar-import-file "/here/is/calendar.ics"
                            "/there/goes/ical-diary")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You can use an <code>#include</code> directive to add the import file contents
to the main diary file, if these are different files. 
See <a href="#Fancy-Diary-Display">Fancy Diary Display</a>.

   <p><a name="index-icalendar_002dexport_002dfile_002c-icalendar_002dexport_002dregion-3695"></a>  Use <code>icalendar-export-file</code> to interactively export an entire
Emacs diary file to iCalendar format.  To export only a part of a diary
file, mark the relevant area, and call <code>icalendar-export-region</code>. 
In both cases, Emacs appends the result to the target file.

<h3 class="section">31.13 Daylight Saving Time</h3>

<p><a name="index-daylight-saving-time-3696"></a>
  Emacs understands the difference between standard time and daylight
saving time&mdash;the times given for sunrise, sunset, solstices,
equinoxes, and the phases of the moon take that into account.  The rules
for daylight saving time vary from place to place and have also varied
historically from year to year.  To do the job properly, Emacs needs to
know which rules to use.

   <p><a name="index-calendar_002ddaylight_002dsavings_002dstarts-3697"></a><a name="index-calendar_002ddaylight_002dsavings_002dends-3698"></a>  Some operating systems keep track of the rules that apply to the place
where you are; on these systems, Emacs gets the information it needs
from the system automatically.  If some or all of this information is
missing, Emacs fills in the gaps with the rules currently used in
Cambridge, Massachusetts.  If the resulting rules are not what you want,
you can tell Emacs the rules to use by setting certain variables:
<code>calendar-daylight-savings-starts</code> and
<code>calendar-daylight-savings-ends</code>.

   <p>These values should be Lisp expressions that refer to the variable
<code>year</code>, and evaluate to the Gregorian date on which daylight
saving time starts or (respectively) ends, in the form of a list
<code>(</code><var>month</var> <var>day</var> <var>year</var><code>)</code>.  The values should be
<code>nil</code> if your area does not use daylight saving time.

   <p>Emacs uses these expressions to determine the starting date of
daylight saving time for the holiday list and for correcting times of
day in the solar and lunar calculations.

   <p>The values for Cambridge, Massachusetts are as follows:

<pre class="example">     (calendar-nth-named-day 2 0 3 year)
     (calendar-nth-named-day 1 0 11 year)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">That is, the second 0th day (Sunday) of the third month (March) in
the year specified by <code>year</code>, and the first Sunday of the eleventh month
(November) of that year.  If daylight saving time were
changed to start on October 1, you would set
<code>calendar-daylight-savings-starts</code> to this:

<pre class="example">     (list 10 1 year)
</pre>
   <p>If there is no daylight saving time at your location, or if you want
all times in standard time, set <code>calendar-daylight-savings-starts</code>
and <code>calendar-daylight-savings-ends</code> to <code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-calendar_002ddaylight_002dtime_002doffset-3699"></a>  The variable <code>calendar-daylight-time-offset</code> specifies the
difference between daylight saving time and standard time, measured in
minutes.  The value for Cambridge, Massachusetts is 60.

<!-- @vindex calendar-daylight-savings-starts-time  too long! -->
<p><a name="index-calendar_002ddaylight_002dsavings_002dends_002dtime-3700"></a>  Finally, the two variables
<code>calendar-daylight-savings-starts-time</code> and
<code>calendar-daylight-savings-ends-time</code> specify the number of
minutes after midnight local time when the transition to and from
daylight saving time should occur.  For Cambridge, Massachusetts both
variables' values are 120.

<h3 class="section">31.14 Summing Time Intervals</h3>

<p><a name="index-time-intervals_002c-summing-3701"></a><a name="index-summing-time-intervals-3702"></a><a name="index-timeclock-3703"></a>
  The timeclock package adds up time intervals, so you can (for
instance) keep track of how much time you spend working on particular
projects.

   <p><a name="index-timeclock_002din-3704"></a><a name="index-timeclock_002dout-3705"></a><a name="index-timeclock_002dchange-3706"></a><a name="index-timeclock_002dworkday_002dremaining-3707"></a><a name="index-timeclock_002dwhen_002dto_002dleave-3708"></a>  Use the <kbd>M-x timeclock-in</kbd> command when you start working on a
project, and <kbd>M-x timeclock-out</kbd> command when you're done.  Each
time you do this, it adds one time interval to the record of the
project.  You can change to working on a different project with <kbd>M-x
timeclock-change</kbd>.

   <p>Once you've collected data from a number of time intervals, you can use
<kbd>M-x timeclock-workday-remaining</kbd> to see how much time is left to
work today (assuming a typical average of 8 hours a day), and <kbd>M-x
timeclock-when-to-leave</kbd> which will calculate when you're done.

   <p><a name="index-timeclock_002dmodeline_002ddisplay-3709"></a><a name="index-timeclock_002dmodeline_002ddisplay-3710"></a>  If you want Emacs to display the amount of time left of your
workday in the mode line, either customize the
<code>timeclock-modeline-display</code> variable and set its value to
<code>t</code>, or invoke the <kbd>M-x timeclock-modeline-display</kbd> command.

   <p><a name="index-timeclock_002dask_002dbefore_002dexiting-3711"></a>  Terminating the current Emacs session might or might not mean that
you have stopped working on the project and, by default, Emacs asks
you.  You can, however, customize the value of the variable
<code>timeclock-ask-before-exiting</code> to <code>nil</code> to avoid the question;
then, only an explicit <kbd>M-x timeclock-out</kbd> or <kbd>M-x
timeclock-change</kbd> will tell Emacs that the current interval is over.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007btimelog_007d-file-3712"></a><a name="index-timeclock_002dfile-3713"></a><a name="index-timeclock_002dreread_002dlog-3714"></a>  The timeclock functions work by accumulating the data in a file
called <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs.d/timelog</span></samp>.  You can specify a
different name for this file by customizing the variable
<code>timeclock-file</code>.  If you edit the timeclock file manually, or if
you change the value of any of timeclock's customizable variables, you
should run the command <kbd>M-x timeclock-reread-log</kbd> to update the
data in Emacs from the file.

<h4 class="subsection">31.15.1 Customizing the Calendar</h4>

<p><a name="index-calendar_002dintermonth_002dtext-3715"></a><a name="index-calendar-layout-3716"></a><a name="index-calendar-week-numbers-3717"></a>  The calendar display unfortunately cannot be changed from three
months, but you can customize the whitespace used by setting the
variables: <code>calendar-left-margin</code>,
<code>calendar-day-header-width</code>, <code>calendar-day-digit-width</code>,
<code>calendar-column-width</code>, and <code>calendar-intermonth-spacing</code>. 
To display text <em>between</em> the months, for example week numbers,
customize the variables <code>calendar-intermonth-header</code> and
<code>calendar-intermonth-text</code> as described in their documentation.

   <p><a name="index-calendar_002dmonth_002dheader-3718"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dday_002dheader_002darray-3719"></a>  The variable <code>calendar-month-header</code> controls the text that
appears above each month in the calendar.  By default, it shows the
month and year.  The variable <code>calendar-day-header-array</code>
controls the text that appears above each day's column in every month. 
By default, it shows the first two letters of each day's name.

   <p><a name="index-calendar_002dholiday_002dmarker-3720"></a><a name="index-diary_002dentry_002dmarker-3721"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dtoday_002dmarker-3722"></a>  The variable <code>calendar-holiday-marker</code> specifies how to mark a
date that is a holiday.  Its value may be a single-character string to
insert next to the date, or a face name to use for displaying the date. 
Likewise, the variable <code>diary-entry-marker</code> specifies how to mark a
date that has diary entries.  The function <code>calendar-mark-today</code>
uses <code>calendar-today-marker</code> to mark today's date.  By default,
the calendar uses faces named <code>holiday</code>, <code>diary</code>, and
<code>calendar-today</code> for these purposes.

   <p><a name="index-calendar_002dload_002dhook-3723"></a>  The variable <code>calendar-load-hook</code> is a normal hook run when the
calendar package is first loaded (before actually starting to display
the calendar).

   <p><a name="index-calendar_002dinitial_002dwindow_002dhook-3724"></a>  Starting the calendar runs the normal hook
<code>calendar-initial-window-hook</code>.  Recomputation of the calendar
display does not run this hook.  But if you leave the calendar with the
<kbd>q</kbd> command and reenter it, the hook runs again.

   <p><a name="index-calendar_002dtoday_002dvisible_002dhook-3725"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dstar_002ddate-3726"></a>  The variable <code>calendar-today-visible-hook</code> is a normal hook run
after the calendar buffer has been prepared with the calendar, when the
current date is visible in the window.  One use of this hook is to
mark today's date; to do that use either of the functions
<code>calendar-mark-today</code> or <code>calendar-star-date</code>:

   <p><a name="index-calendar_002dmark_002dtoday-3727"></a>
<pre class="smallexample">     (add-hook 'calendar-today-visible-hook 'calendar-mark-today)
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-calendar_002dtoday_002dinvisible_002dhook-3728"></a>A similar normal hook, <code>calendar-today-invisible-hook</code> is run if
the current date is <em>not</em> visible in the window.

   <p><a name="index-calendar_002dmove_002dhook-3729"></a>  Each of the calendar cursor motion commands runs the hook
<code>calendar-move-hook</code> after it moves the cursor.

knows about.  These are: <code>holiday-general-holidays</code>,
<code>holiday-local-holidays</code>, <code>holiday-solar-holidays</code>,
<code>holiday-bahai-holidays</code>, <code>holiday-christian-holidays</code>,
<code>holiday-hebrew-holidays</code>, <code>holiday-islamic-holidays</code>,
<code>holiday-oriental-holidays</code>, and <code>holiday-other-holidays</code>. 
The names should be self-explanatory; e.g., <code>holiday-solar-holidays</code>
lists sun- and moon-related holidays.

   <p>You can customize these lists of holidays to your own needs, deleting or
adding holidays as described below.  Set any of them to <code>nil</code> to
not show the associated holidays.

   <p><a name="index-holiday_002dgeneral_002dholidays-3733"></a><a name="index-holiday_002dlocal_002dholidays-3734"></a><a name="index-holiday_002dother_002dholidays-3735"></a>  The general holidays are, by default, holidays common throughout the
United States.  In contrast, <code>holiday-local-holidays</code> and
<code>holiday-other-holidays</code> are both empty by default.  These are
intended for system-wide settings and your individual use,
respectively.

   <p><a name="index-holiday_002dbahai_002dholidays-3736"></a><a name="index-holiday_002dchristian_002dholidays-3737"></a><a name="index-holiday_002dhebrew_002dholidays-3738"></a><a name="index-holiday_002dislamic_002dholidays-3739"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dbahai_002dall_002dholidays_002dflag-3740"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dchristian_002dall_002dholidays_002dflag-3741"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dhebrew_002dall_002dholidays_002dflag-3742"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dislamic_002dall_002dholidays_002dflag-3743"></a>  By default, Emacs does not include all the holidays of the religions
that it knows, only those commonly found in secular calendars.  For a
more extensive collection of religious holidays, you can set any (or
all) of the variables <code>calendar-bahai-all-holidays-flag</code>,
<code>calendar-christian-all-holidays-flag</code>,
<code>calendar-hebrew-all-holidays-flag</code>, or
<code>calendar-islamic-all-holidays-flag</code> to <code>t</code>.

   <p><a name="index-holiday-forms-3744"></a>  Each of the holiday variables is a list of <dfn>holiday forms</dfn>, each
form describing a holiday (or sometimes a list of holidays).  Here is
a table of the possible kinds of holiday form.  Day numbers and month
numbers count starting from 1, but <dfn>dayname</dfn> numbers count Sunday as
0.  The argument <var>string</var> is always the description of the
holiday, as a string.

     <dl>
<dt><code>(holiday-fixed </code><var>month</var> <var>day</var> <var>string</var><code>)</code><dd>A fixed date on the Gregorian calendar.

     <br><dt><code>(holiday-float </code><var>month</var> <var>dayname</var> <var>k</var> <var>string</var><dd>      &amp;optional <var>day</var>)
The <var>k</var>th <var>dayname</var> (<var>dayname</var>=0 for Sunday, and so on)
after or before Gregorian date <var>month</var>, <var>day</var>.  Negative <var>k</var>
means count back from the end of the month.  Optional <var>day</var> defaults
to 1 if <var>k</var> is positive, and the last day of <var>month</var> otherwise.

     <br><dt><code>(holiday-chinese </code><var>month</var> <var>day</var> <var>string</var><code>)</code><dd>A fixed date on the Chinese calendar.

     <br><dt><code>(holiday-hebrew </code><var>month</var> <var>day</var> <var>string</var><code>)</code><dd>A fixed date on the Hebrew calendar.

     <br><dt><code>(holiday-islamic </code><var>month</var> <var>day</var> <var>string</var><code>)</code><dd>A fixed date on the Islamic calendar.

     <br><dt><code>(holiday-julian </code><var>month</var> <var>day</var> <var>string</var><code>)</code><dd>A fixed date on the Julian calendar.

     <br><dt><code>(holiday-sexp </code><var>sexp</var> <var>string</var><code>)</code><dd>A date calculated by the Lisp expression <var>sexp</var>.  The expression
should use the variable <code>year</code> to compute and return the date of a
holiday in the form of a list <code>(</code><var>month</var> <var>day</var> <var>year</var><code>)</code>,
or <code>nil</code> if the holiday doesn't happen this year.

     <br><dt><code>(if </code><var>condition</var> <var>holiday-form</var><code>)</code><dd>A holiday that happens only if <var>condition</var> is true.

</dl>

   <p>For example, suppose you want to add Bastille Day, celebrated in
France on July 14 (i.e., the fourteenth day of the seventh month).  You
can do this as follows:

<pre class="smallexample">     (setq holiday-other-holidays '((holiday-fixed 7 14 "Bastille Day")))
</pre>
   <p>Many holidays occur on a specific day of the week, at a specific time
of month.  Here is a holiday form describing Hurricane Supplication Day,
celebrated in the Virgin Islands on the fourth Monday in July:

<pre class="smallexample">     (holiday-float 7 1 4 "Hurricane Supplication Day")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here the 7 specifies July, the 1 specifies Monday (Sunday is 0,
Tuesday is 2, and so on), and the 4 specifies the fourth occurrence in
the month (1 specifies the first occurrence, 2 the second occurrence,
&minus;1 the last occurrence, &minus;2 the second-to-last occurrence, and
so on).

   <p>You can specify holidays that occur on fixed days of the Bahá'í,
Chinese, Hebrew, Islamic, and Julian calendars too.  For example,

<pre class="smallexample">     (setq holiday-other-holidays
           '((holiday-hebrew 10 2 "Last day of Hanukkah")
             (holiday-islamic 3 12 "Mohammed's Birthday")
             (holiday-julian 4 2 "Jefferson's Birthday")))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">adds the last day of Hanukkah (since the Hebrew months are numbered with
1 starting from Nisan), the Islamic feast celebrating Mohammed's
birthday (since the Islamic months are numbered from 1 starting with
Muharram), and Thomas Jefferson's birthday, which is 2 April 1743 on the
Julian calendar.

   <p>To include a holiday conditionally, use either Emacs Lisp's <code>if</code>
or the <code>holiday-sexp</code> form.  For example, American presidential
elections occur on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November
of years divisible by 4:

<pre class="smallexample">     (holiday-sexp '(if (zerop (% year 4))
                        (calendar-gregorian-from-absolute
                         (1+ (calendar-dayname-on-or-before
                               1 (+ 6 (calendar-absolute-from-gregorian
                                       (list 11 1 year)))))))
                   "US Presidential Election")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">or

<pre class="smallexample">     (if (zerop (% displayed-year 4))
         (holiday-fixed 11
                (calendar-extract-day
                  (calendar-gregorian-from-absolute
                    (1+ (calendar-dayname-on-or-before
                          1 (+ 6 (calendar-absolute-from-gregorian
                                   (list 11 1 displayed-year)))))))
                "US Presidential Election"))
</pre>
   <p>Some holidays just don't fit into any of these forms because special
calculations are involved in their determination.  In such cases you
must write a Lisp function to do the calculation.  To include eclipses,
for example, add <code>(eclipses)</code> to <code>holiday-other-holidays</code>
and write an Emacs Lisp function <code>eclipses</code> that returns a
(possibly empty) list of the relevant Gregorian dates among the range
visible in the calendar window, with descriptive strings, like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (((6 4 2012) "Lunar Eclipse") ((11 13 2012) "Solar Eclipse") ... )

<h4 class="subsection">31.15.3 Converting from the Mayan Calendar</h4>

<p><a name="index-Mayan-calendar-3745"></a>
  Here are the commands to select dates based on the Mayan calendar:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>g m l</kbd><dd>Move to a date specified by the long count calendar
(<code>calendar-mayan-goto-long-count-date</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>g m n t</kbd><dd>Move to the next occurrence of a place in the
tzolkin calendar (<code>calendar-mayan-next-tzolkin-date</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>g m p t</kbd><dd>Move to the previous occurrence of a place in the
tzolkin calendar (<code>calendar-mayan-previous-tzolkin-date</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>g m n h</kbd><dd>Move to the next occurrence of a place in the
haab calendar (<code>calendar-mayan-next-haab-date</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>g m p h</kbd><dd>Move to the previous occurrence of a place in the

<br><dt><kbd>g m n c</kbd><dd>Move to the next occurrence of a place in the

<br><dt><kbd>g m p c</kbd><dd>Move to the previous occurrence of a place in the
calendar round (<code>calendar-mayan-previous-calendar-round-date</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-Mayan-long-count-3746"></a>  To understand these commands, you need to understand the Mayan calendars. 
The <dfn>long count</dfn> is a counting of days with these units:

<pre class="display">     1 kin = 1 day   1 uinal = 20 kin   1 tun = 18 uinal
     1 katun = 20 tun   1 baktun = 20 katun
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-g-m-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3747"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dmayan_002dgoto_002dlong_002dcount_002ddate-3748"></a>Thus, the long count date 12.16.11.16.6 means 12 baktun, 16 katun, 11
tun, 16 uinal, and 6 kin.  The Emacs calendar can handle Mayan long
count dates as early as 7.17.18.13.3, but no earlier.  When you use the
<kbd>g m l</kbd> command, type the Mayan long count date with the baktun,
katun, tun, uinal, and kin separated by periods.

   <p><a name="index-calendar_002dmayan_002dprevious_002dtzolkin_002ddate-3749"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dmayan_002dnext_002dtzolkin_002ddate-3750"></a><a name="index-Mayan-tzolkin-calendar-3751"></a>  The Mayan tzolkin calendar is a cycle of 260 days formed by a pair of
independent cycles of 13 and 20 days.  Since this cycle repeats
endlessly, Emacs provides commands to move backward and forward to the
previous or next point in the cycle.  Type <kbd>g m p t</kbd> to go to the
previous tzolkin date; Emacs asks you for a tzolkin date and moves point
to the previous occurrence of that date.  Similarly, type <kbd>g m n t</kbd>
to go to the next occurrence of a tzolkin date.

   <p><a name="index-calendar_002dmayan_002dprevious_002dhaab_002ddate-3752"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dmayan_002dnext_002dhaab_002ddate-3753"></a><a name="index-Mayan-haab-calendar-3754"></a>  The Mayan haab calendar is a cycle of 365 days arranged as 18 months
of 20 days each, followed by a 5-day monthless period.  Like the tzolkin
cycle, this cycle repeats endlessly, and there are commands to move
backward and forward to the previous or next point in the cycle.  Type
<kbd>g m p h</kbd> to go to the previous haab date; Emacs asks you for a haab
date and moves point to the previous occurrence of that date. 
Similarly, type <kbd>g m n h</kbd> to go to the next occurrence of a haab
date.

<!-- This is omitted because it is too long for smallbook format. -->
<!-- @findex calendar-mayan-previous-calendar-round-date -->
<p><a name="index-calendar_002dmayan_002dnext_002dcalendar_002dround_002ddate-3755"></a><a name="index-Mayan-calendar-round-3756"></a>  The Maya also used the combination of the tzolkin date and the haab
date.  This combination is a cycle of about 52 years called a
<em>calendar round</em>.  If you type <kbd>g m p c</kbd>, Emacs asks you for
both a haab and a tzolkin date and then moves point to the previous
occurrence of that combination.  Use <kbd>g m n c</kbd> to move point to the
next occurrence of a combination.  These commands signal an error if the
haab/tzolkin date combination you have typed is impossible.

   <p>Emacs uses strict completion
(see <a href="#Completion-Exit">Completion Exit</a>)
whenever it asks you to type a Mayan name, so you don't have to worry
about spelling.

  You can customize the way dates are displayed in the diary, mode
lines, and messages by setting <code>calendar-date-display-form</code>. 
This variable holds a list of expressions that can involve the variables
<code>month</code>, <code>day</code>, and <code>year</code>, which are all numbers in
string form, and <code>monthname</code> and <code>dayname</code>, which are both
alphabetic strings.  In the American style, the default value of this
list is as follows:

<pre class="smallexample">     ((if dayname (concat dayname ", ")) monthname " " day ", " year)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">while in the European style this value is the default:

<pre class="smallexample">     ((if dayname (concat dayname ", ")) day " " monthname " " year)

   <p class="noindent">The default ISO date representation is:

<pre class="smallexample">     ((format "%s-%.2d-%.2d" year (string-to-number month)

<h4 class="subsection">31.15.6 Customizing the Diary</h4>

<p><a name="index-diary_002dshow_002dholidays_002dflag-3759"></a>  Ordinarily, the diary window indicates any holidays that fall on the
date of the diary entries, either in the mode line or the buffer itself. 
The process of checking for holidays can be slow, depending on the
defined holidays.  In that case, setting <code>diary-show-holidays-flag</code>
to <code>nil</code> will speed up the diary display.

   <p><a name="index-diary_002dnumber_002dof_002dentries-3760"></a>  The variable <code>diary-number-of-entries</code> controls the number of
days of diary entries to be displayed at one time.  It affects the
initial display when <code>calendar-view-diary-initially-flag</code> is
<code>t</code>, as well as the command <kbd>M-x diary</kbd>.  For example, a value
of 1 (the default) displays only the current day's diary entries,
whereas a value of 2 will also show the next day's entries.  The value
can also be a vector of seven integers: for example, if the value is
<code>[0 2 2 2 2 4 1]</code> then no diary entries appear on Sunday, the
current date's and the next day's diary entries appear Monday through
Thursday, Friday through Monday's entries appear on Friday, while on
Saturday only that day's entries appear.

   <p><a name="index-diary_002ddate_002dforms-3761"></a>  You can customize the form of dates in your diary file by setting the
variable <code>diary-date-forms</code>.  This variable is a list of patterns
for recognizing a date.  Each date pattern is a list whose elements may
be regular expressions (see <a href="elisp.html#Regular-Expressions">Regular Expressions</a>) or the symbols <code>month</code>, <code>day</code>,
<code>year</code>, <code>monthname</code>, and <code>dayname</code>.  All these elements
serve as patterns that match certain kinds of text in the diary file. 
In order for the date pattern as a whole to match, all of its elements
must match consecutively.

   <p>A regular expression in a date pattern matches in its usual fashion,
using the standard syntax table altered so that `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' is a word
constituent.

   <p>The symbols <code>month</code>, <code>day</code>, <code>year</code>, <code>monthname</code>,
and <code>dayname</code> match the month number, day number, year number,
month name, and day name of the date being considered.  The symbols that
match numbers allow leading zeros; those that match names allow
capitalization and abbreviation (as specified by
<code>calendar-month-abbrev-array</code> and
<code>calendar-day-abbrev-array</code>).  All the symbols can match `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>';
since `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' in a diary entry means &ldquo;any day&rdquo;, &ldquo;any month&rdquo;, and so
on, it should match regardless of the date being considered.

   <p>The default value of <code>diary-date-forms</code> in the American style is
provided by <code>diary-american-date-forms</code>:

<pre class="example">     ((month "/" day "[^/0-9]")
      (month "/" day "/" year "[^0-9]")
      (monthname " *" day "[^,0-9]")
      (monthname " *" day ", *" year "[^0-9]")
      (dayname "\\W"))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The variables <code>diary-european-date-forms</code> and
<code>diary-iso-date-forms</code> provide other default styles.

   <p>The date patterns in the list must be <em>mutually exclusive</em> and
must not match any portion of the diary entry itself, just the date and
one character of whitespace.  If, to be mutually exclusive, the pattern
must match a portion of the diary entry text&mdash;beyond the whitespace
that ends the date&mdash;then the first element of the date pattern
<em>must</em> be <code>backup</code>.  This causes the date recognizer to back
up to the beginning of the current word of the diary entry, after
finishing the match.  Even if you use <code>backup</code>, the date pattern
must absolutely not match more than a portion of the first word of the
diary entry.  For example, the default value of
<code>diary-european-date-forms</code> is:

<pre class="example">     ((day "/" month "[^/0-9]")
      (day "/" month "/" year "[^0-9]")
      (backup day " *" monthname "\\W+\\&lt;\\([^*0-9]\\|\\([0-9]+[:aApP]\\)\\)")
      (day " *" monthname " *" year "[^0-9]")
      (dayname "\\W"))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Notice the use of <code>backup</code> in the third pattern, because it needs
to match part of a word beyond the date itself to distinguish it from
the fourth pattern.

<h4 class="subsection">31.15.7 Diary Entries Using non-Gregorian Calendars</h4>

<p>As well as entries based on the standard Gregorian calendar, your
diary can have entries based on Bahá'í, Chinese, Hebrew, or Islamic dates. 
Recognition of such entries can be time-consuming, however, and since
most people don't use them, you must explicitly enable their use.  If
you want the diary to recognize Hebrew-date diary entries, for example,
you must do this:

   <p><a name="index-diary_002dnongregorian_002dlisting_002dhook-3762"></a><a name="index-diary_002dnongregorian_002dmarking_002dhook-3763"></a><a name="index-diary_002dhebrew_002dlist_002dentries-3764"></a><a name="index-diary_002dhebrew_002dmark_002dentries-3765"></a><a name="index-diary_002dislamic_002dlist_002dentries-3766"></a><a name="index-diary_002dislamic_002dmark_002dentries-3767"></a><a name="index-diary_002dbahai_002dlist_002dentries-3768"></a><a name="index-diary_002dbahai_002dmark_002dentries-3769"></a><a name="index-diary_002dchinese_002dlist_002dentries-3770"></a><a name="index-diary_002dchinese_002dmark_002dentries-3771"></a>
<pre class="smallexample">     (add-hook 'diary-nongregorian-listing-hook 'diary-hebrew-list-entries)
     (add-hook 'diary-nongregorian-marking-hook 'diary-hebrew-mark-entries)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Similarly, for Islamic, Bahá'í and Chinese entries, add
<code>diary-islamic-list-entries</code> and <code>diary-islamic-mark-entries</code>,
<code>diary-bahai-list-entries</code> and <code>diary-bahai-mark-entries</code>,
or <code>diary-chinese-list-entries</code> and <code>diary-chinese-mark-entries</code>.

   <p><a name="index-diary_002dbahai_002dentry_002dsymbol-3772"></a><a name="index-diary_002dchinese_002dentry_002dsymbol-3773"></a><a name="index-diary_002dhebrew_002dentry_002dsymbol-3774"></a><a name="index-diary_002dislamic_002dentry_002dsymbol-3775"></a>  These diary entries have the same formats as Gregorian-date diary
entries; except that <code>diary-bahai-entry-symbol</code> (default `<samp><span class="samp">B</span></samp>')
must precede a Bahá'í date, <code>diary-chinese-entry-symbol</code> (default
`<samp><span class="samp">C</span></samp>') a Chinese date, <code>diary-hebrew-entry-symbol</code> (default
`<samp><span class="samp">H</span></samp>') a Hebrew date, and <code>diary-islamic-entry-symbol</code> (default
`<samp><span class="samp">I</span></samp>') an Islamic date.  Moreover, non-Gregorian month names may not
be abbreviated (because the first three letters are often not unique). 
(Note also that you must use &ldquo;Adar I&rdquo; if you want Adar of a common
Hebrew year.)  For example, a diary entry for the Hebrew date Heshvan 25
could look like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     HHeshvan 25 Happy Hebrew birthday!
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and would appear in the diary for any date that corresponds to Heshvan 25
on the Hebrew calendar.  And here is an Islamic-date diary entry that matches
Dhu al-Qada 25:

<pre class="smallexample">     IDhu al-Qada 25 Happy Islamic birthday!
</pre>
   <p>As with Gregorian-date diary entries, non-Gregorian entries are
nonmarking if preceded by <code>diary-nonmarking-symbol</code> (default
`<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>').

   <p>Here is a table of commands used in the calendar to create diary
entries that match the selected date and other dates that are similar in
the Bahá'í, Chinese, Hebrew, or Islamic calendars:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>i h d</kbd><dd><code>diary-hebrew-insert-entry</code>

  These commands work much like the corresponding commands for ordinary
diary entries: they apply to the date that point is on in the calendar
window, and what they do is insert just the date portion of a diary
entry at the end of your diary file.  You must then insert the rest of
the diary entry.  The basic commands add an entry for the specific
non-Gregorian date, the `<samp><span class="samp">monthly</span></samp>' commands for the given
non-Gregorian day-within-month in every month, and the `<samp><span class="samp">yearly</span></samp>'
commands for the given non-Gregorian day and month in every year.

  Diary display works by preparing the list of diary entries and then
running the function specified by the variable
<code>diary-display-function</code>.  The default value
<code>diary-fancy-display</code> displays diary entries and holidays by
copying them into a special buffer that exists only for the sake of
display.  Copying diary entries to a separate buffer provides an
opportunity to change the displayed text to make it prettier&mdash;for
example, to sort the entries by the dates they apply to.

   <p><a name="index-diary_002dlist_002dinclude_002dblanks-3793"></a>  Ordinarily, the fancy diary buffer does not show days for which there
are no diary entries, even if that day is a holiday.  If you want such
days to be shown in the fancy diary buffer, set the variable
<code>diary-list-include-blanks</code> to <code>t</code>.

   <p>The fancy diary buffer enables View mode
(see <a href="#View-Mode">View Mode</a>).

   <p>The alternative display method <code>diary-simple-display</code> shows the
actual diary buffer, and uses invisible text to hide entries that don't
apply.  Holidays are shown in the mode line.  The advantage of this
method is that you can edit the buffer and save your changes directly to
the diary file.  This method is not as flexible as the fancy method,
however.  For example, it cannot sort entries.  Another disadvantage is
that invisible text can be confusing.  For example, if you copy a region
of text in order to paste it elsewhere, invisible text may be included. 
Similarly, since the diary buffer as you see it is an illusion, simply
printing the buffer may not print what you see on your screen.

   <p><a name="index-diary_002dprint_002dentries_002dhook-3794"></a><a name="index-diary_002dprint_002dentries-3795"></a>  For this reason, there is a special command to print hard copy of the
diary buffer <em>as it appears</em>; this command is <kbd>M-x
diary-print-entries</kbd>.  It works with either display method, although
with the fancy display you can also print the buffer like any other.  To
print a hard copy of a day-by-day diary for a week, position point on
the first day of the week, type <kbd>7 d</kbd>, and then do <kbd>M-x
diary-print-entries</kbd>.  As usual, the inclusion of the holidays slows
down the display slightly; you can speed things up by setting the
variable <code>diary-show-holidays-flag</code> to <code>nil</code>.

   <p>This command prepares a temporary buffer that contains only the diary
entries currently visible in the diary buffer.  Unlike with the simple
display, the other irrelevant entries are really absent, not just
hidden.  After preparing the buffer, it runs the hook
<code>diary-print-entries-hook</code>.  The default value of this hook sends
the data directly to the printer with the command <code>lpr-buffer</code>
(see <a href="#Printing">Printing</a>). 
If you want to use a different command to do the
printing, just change the value of this hook.  Other uses might include,
for example, rearranging the lines into order by day and time.

   <p>You can edit the diary entries as they appear in the simple diary
window, but it is important to remember that the buffer displayed
contains the <em>entire</em> diary file, with portions of it concealed
from view.  This means, for instance, that the <kbd>C-f</kbd>
(<code>forward-char</code>) command can put point at what appears to be the
end of the line, but what is in reality the middle of some concealed
line.

   <p><em>Be careful when editing the diary entries in the simple display!</em>
Inserting additional lines or adding/deleting characters in the middle
of a visible line cannot cause problems, but editing at the end of a
line may not do what you expect.  Deleting a line may delete other
invisible entries that follow it.  Before editing the simple diary
buffer, it is best to display the entire file with <kbd>s</kbd>
(<code>diary-show-all-entries</code>).

<h4 class="subsection">31.15.9 Fancy Diary Display</h4>

<p>The following features only work with the fancy diary display.

   <p><a name="index-sorting-diary-entries-3796"></a>  You can use the normal hook <code>diary-list-entries-hook</code> to sort
each day's diary entries by their time of day.  Here's how:

   <p><a name="index-diary_002dsort_002dentries-3797"></a>
<pre class="example">     (add-hook 'diary-list-entries-hook 'diary-sort-entries t)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">For each day, this sorts diary entries that begin with a recognizable
time of day according to their times.  Diary entries without times come
first within each day.  Note how the sort command is placed at the end
of the hook list, in case earlier members of the list change the order
of the diary entries, or add items.

   <p><a name="index-diary_002dcomment_002dstart-3798"></a>  You can write `<samp><span class="samp">comments</span></samp>' in diary entries, by setting the
variables <code>diary-comment-start</code> and <code>diary-comment-end</code> to
strings that delimit comments.  The fancy display does not print
comments.  You might want to put meta-data for the use of other packages
(e.g., the appointment package,
see <a href="#Appointments">Appointments</a>)
inside comments.

   <p><a name="index-diary_002dinclude_002dstring-3799"></a>  Your main diary file can include other files.  This permits a group of
people to share a diary file for events that apply to all of them. 
Lines in the diary file starting with <code>diary-include-string</code>:

<pre class="smallexample">     #include "<var>filename</var>"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">include the diary entries from the file <var>filename</var> in the fancy
diary buffer.  The include mechanism is recursive, so that included
files can include other files, and so on (you must be careful not to
have a cycle of inclusions, of course).  Here is how to enable the
include facility:

   <p><a name="index-diary_002dlist_002dentries_002dhook-3800"></a><a name="index-diary_002dmark_002dentries_002dhook-3801"></a><a name="index-diary_002dinclude_002dother_002ddiary_002dfiles-3802"></a><a name="index-diary_002dmark_002dincluded_002ddiary_002dfiles-3803"></a>
<pre class="smallexample">     (add-hook 'diary-list-entries-hook 'diary-include-other-diary-files)
     (add-hook 'diary-mark-entries-hook 'diary-mark-included-diary-files)
</pre>
   <p>The include mechanism works only with the fancy diary display, because
simple diary display shows the entries directly from your diary file.

<h4 class="subsection">31.15.10 Sexp Entries and the Fancy Diary Display</h4>

<p><a name="index-sexp-diary-entries-3804"></a>
<a name="index-diary_002dsexp_002dentry_002dsymbol-3805"></a>  Sexp diary entries allow you to do more than just have complicated
conditions under which a diary entry applies.  Sexp entries should be
preceded by <code>diary-sexp-entry-symbol</code> (default `<samp><span class="samp">%%</span></samp>') in the
diary file.  With the fancy diary display, sexp entries can generate the
text of the entry depending on the date itself.

   <p>For example, an anniversary diary entry can insert
the number of years since the anniversary date into the text of the
diary entry.  Thus the `<samp><span class="samp">%d</span></samp>' in this diary entry:

   <p><a name="index-diary_002danniversary-3806"></a>
<pre class="smallexample">     %%(diary-anniversary 10 31 1948) Arthur's birthday (%d years old)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">gets replaced by the age, so on October 31, 1990 the entry appears in
the fancy diary buffer like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     Arthur's birthday (42 years old)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If the diary file instead contains this entry:

<pre class="smallexample">     %%(diary-anniversary 10 31 1948) Arthur's %d%s birthday
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">the entry in the fancy diary buffer for October 31, 1990 appears like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     Arthur's 42nd birthday
</pre>
   <p>Similarly, cyclic diary entries can interpolate the number of repetitions
that have occurred:

   <p><a name="index-diary_002dcyclic-3807"></a>
<pre class="smallexample">     %%(diary-cyclic 50 1 1 2012) Renew medication (%d%s time)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     Renew medication (5th time)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">in the fancy diary display on September 7, 2012.

   <p>There is an early-reminder diary sexp that includes its entry in the
diary not only on the date of occurrence, but also on earlier dates. 
For example, if you want a reminder a week before your anniversary, you
can use

   <p><a name="index-diary_002dremind-3808"></a>
<pre class="smallexample">     %%(diary-remind '(diary-anniversary 12 22 1968) 7) Ed's anniversary
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and the fancy diary will show `<samp><span class="samp">Ed's anniversary</span></samp>' both on December
15 and on December 22.

   <p><a name="index-diary_002ddate-3809"></a>  The function <code>diary-date</code> applies to dates described by a month,
day, year combination, each of which can be an integer, a list of
integers, or <code>t</code> (meaning all values).  For example,

<pre class="smallexample">     %%(diary-date '(10 11 12) 22 t) Rake leaves
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">causes the fancy diary to show

<pre class="smallexample">     Rake leaves
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">on October 22, November 22, and December 22 of every year.

   <p><a name="index-diary_002dfloat-3810"></a>  The function <code>diary-float</code> allows you to describe diary entries
that apply to dates like the third Friday of November, or the last
Tuesday in April.  The parameters are the <var>month</var>, <var>dayname</var>,
and an index <var>n</var>.  The entry appears on the <var>n</var>th <var>dayname</var>
after the first day of <var>month</var>, where <var>dayname</var>=0 means Sunday,
1 means Monday, and so on.  If <var>n</var> is negative it counts backward
from the end of <var>month</var>.  The value of <var>month</var> can be a list of
months, a single month, or <code>t</code> to specify all months.  You can also
use an optional parameter <var>day</var> to specify the <var>n</var>th
<var>dayname</var> on or after/before <var>day</var> of <var>month</var>; the value of
<var>day</var> defaults to 1 if <var>n</var> is positive and to the last day of
<var>month</var> if <var>n</var> is negative.  For example,

<pre class="smallexample">     %%(diary-float t 1 -1) Pay rent
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">causes the fancy diary to show

<pre class="smallexample">     Pay rent
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">on the last Monday of every month.

   <p>The generality of sexp diary entries lets you specify any diary
entry that you can describe algorithmically.  A sexp diary entry
contains an expression that computes whether the entry applies to any
given date.  If its value is non-<code>nil</code>, the entry applies to that
date; otherwise, it does not.  The expression can use the variable
<code>date</code> to find the date being considered; its value is a list
(<var>month</var> <var>day</var> <var>year</var>) that refers to the Gregorian
calendar.

   <p>The sexp diary entry applies to a date when the expression's value
is non-<code>nil</code>, but some values have more specific meanings.  If
the value is a string, that string is a description of the event which
occurs on that date.  The value can also have the form
<code>(</code><var>mark</var><code> . </code><var>string</var><code>)</code>; then <var>mark</var> specifies how to
mark the date in the calendar, and <var>string</var> is the description of
the event.  If <var>mark</var> is a single-character string, that character
appears next to the date in the calendar.  If <var>mark</var> is a face
name, the date is displayed in that face.  If <var>mark</var> is
<code>nil</code>, that specifies no particular highlighting for the date.

   <p>Suppose you get paid on the 21st of the month if it is a weekday, and
on the Friday before if the 21st is on a weekend.  Here is how to write
a sexp diary entry that matches those dates:

<pre class="smallexample">     &amp;%%(let ((dayname (calendar-day-of-week date))
              (day (cadr date)))
           (or (and (= day 21) (memq dayname '(1 2 3 4 5)))
               (and (memq day '(19 20)) (= dayname 5)))
              ) Pay check deposited
</pre>
   <p>The following sexp diary entries take advantage of the ability (in the fancy
diary display) to concoct diary entries whose text varies based on the date:

   <p><a name="index-diary_002dsunrise_002dsunset-3811"></a><a name="index-diary_002dlunar_002dphases-3812"></a><a name="index-diary_002dday_002dof_002dyear-3813"></a><a name="index-diary_002diso_002ddate-3814"></a><a name="index-diary_002djulian_002ddate-3815"></a><a name="index-diary_002dastro_002dday_002dnumber-3816"></a><a name="index-diary_002dbahai_002ddate-3817"></a><a name="index-diary_002dchinese_002ddate-3818"></a><a name="index-diary_002dcoptic_002ddate-3819"></a><a name="index-diary_002dethiopic_002ddate-3820"></a><a name="index-diary_002dhebrew_002ddate-3821"></a><a name="index-diary_002dislamic_002ddate-3822"></a><a name="index-diary_002dfrench_002ddate-3823"></a><a name="index-diary_002dmayan_002ddate-3824"></a><a name="index-diary_002dpersian_002ddate-3825"></a>
     <dl>

<br><dt><code>%%(diary-persian-date)</code><dd>Make a diary entry with today's equivalent Persian calendar date. 
</dl>

<p class="noindent">For example, including the diary entry

<pre class="smallexample">     &amp;%%(diary-hebrew-date)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">causes every day's diary display to contain the equivalent date on the
Hebrew calendar, if you are using the fancy diary display.  (With simple
diary display, the literal line `<samp><span class="samp">&amp;%%(diary-hebrew-date)</span></samp>' appears in
the diary for any date.)

   <p>This function has been used to construct certain standard Hebrew sexp
diary entries:

   <p><a name="index-rosh-hodesh-3826"></a><a name="index-diary_002dhebrew_002drosh_002dhodesh-3827"></a><a name="index-parasha_002c-weekly-3828"></a><a name="index-diary_002dhebrew_002dparasha-3829"></a><a name="index-candle-lighting-times-3830"></a><a name="index-diary_002dhebrew_002dsabbath_002dcandles-3831"></a><a name="index-omer-count-3832"></a><a name="index-diary_002dhebrew_002domer-3833"></a><a name="index-yahrzeits-3834"></a><a name="index-diary_002dhebrew_002dyahrzeit-3835"></a><a name="index-diary_002dhebrew_002dbirthday-3836"></a>
     <dl>

new Hebrew month. 
<br><dt><code>%%(diary-hebrew-parasha)</code><dd>Make a Saturday diary entry that tells the weekly synagogue scripture reading. 
<br><dt><code>%%(diary-hebrew-sabbath-candles)</code><dd>Make a Friday diary entry that tells the <em>local time</em> of Sabbath
candle lighting. 
<br><dt><code>%%(diary-hebrew-omer)</code><dd>Make a diary entry that gives the omer count, when appropriate. 
<br><dt><code>%%(diary-hebrew-yahrzeit </code><var>month</var> <var>day</var> <var>year</var><code>) </code><var>name</var><dd>Make a diary entry marking the anniversary of a date of death.  The date
is the <em>Gregorian</em> (civil) date of death.  The diary entry appears
on the proper Hebrew calendar anniversary and on the day before.  (The
order of the parameters changes according to the calendar date style;
for example in the European style to <var>day</var>, <var>month</var>, <var>year</var>.) 
<br><dt><code>%%(diary-hebrew-birthday </code><var>month</var> <var>day</var> <var>year</var><code>)</code><dd>Make a diary entry for a birthday on the Hebrew calendar. 
</dl>

   <p>All the functions documented above take an optional argument
<var>mark</var> which specifies how to mark the date in the calendar display. 
If one of these functions decides that it applies to a certain date,
it returns a value that contains <var>mark</var>, as described above.

<a name="index-C_002dx-m-3841"></a><a name="index-compose_002dmail-3842"></a>  To send an email message from Emacs, type <kbd>C-x m</kbd>.  This
switches to a buffer named <samp><span class="file">*unsent mail*</span></samp>, where you can edit
the text and headers of the message.  When done, type <kbd>C-c C-s</kbd> or
<kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> to send it.

</dl>

   <p>The mail buffer is an ordinary Emacs buffer, so you can switch to
other buffers while composing the mail.  If you want to send another
mail before finishing the current one, type <kbd>C-x m</kbd> again to open
a new mail buffer whose name has a different numeric suffix
(see <a href="#Misc-Buffer">Misc Buffer</a>).  If you invoke the command with a prefix
argument, <kbd>C-u&nbsp;C-x&nbsp;m</kbd><!-- /@w -->, Emacs switches back to the last mail
buffer, and asks if you want to erase the message in that buffer; if
you answer no, this lets you pick up editing the message where you
left off.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-4-m-3843"></a><a name="index-compose_002dmail_002dother_002dwindow-3844"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-5-m-3845"></a><a name="index-compose_002dmail_002dother_002dframe-3846"></a>  The command <kbd>C-x 4 m</kbd> (<code>compose-mail-other-window</code>) does
the same as <kbd>C-x m</kbd>, except it displays the mail buffer in a
different window.  The command <kbd>C-x 5 m</kbd>
(<code>compose-mail-other-frame</code>) does it in a new frame.

   <p>When you type <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> or <kbd>C-c C-s</kbd> to send the mail, Emacs
may ask you how it should deliver the mail&mdash;either directly via SMTP,
or using some other method.  See <a href="#Mail-Sending">Mail Sending</a>, for details.

<h3 class="section">32.1 The Format of the Mail Buffer</h3>

<p>Here is an example of the contents of a mail buffer:

<pre class="example">     To: subotai@example.org
     CC: mongol.soldier@example.net, rms@gnu.org
     Subject: Re: What is best in life?
     From: conan@example.org
     --text follows this line--
     To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to
     hear the lamentation of their women.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">At the top of the mail buffer is a set of <dfn>header fields</dfn>, which
are used for specifying information about the email's recipient(s),
subject, and so on.  The above buffer contains header fields for
`<samp><span class="samp">To</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">Cc</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">Subject</span></samp>', and `<samp><span class="samp">From</span></samp>'.  Some header
fields are automatically pre-initialized in the mail buffer, when
appropriate.

   <p>The line that says `<samp><span class="samp">--text follows this line--</span></samp>' separates the
header fields from the <dfn>body</dfn> (or <dfn>text</dfn>) of the message. 
Everything above that line is treated as part of the headers;
everything below it is treated as the body.  The delimiter line itself
does not appear in the message actually sent.

   <p>You can insert and edit header fields using ordinary editing
commands.  See <a href="#Header-Editing">Header Editing</a>, for commands specific to editing
header fields.  Certain headers, such as `<samp><span class="samp">Date</span></samp>' and
`<samp><span class="samp">Message-Id</span></samp>', are normally omitted from the mail buffer and are
created automatically when the message is sent.

<h3 class="section">32.2 Mail Header Fields</h3>

<p><a name="index-headers-_0028of-mail-message_0029-3847"></a>
  A header field in the mail buffer starts with a field name at the
beginning of a line, terminated by a colon.  Upper and lower case are
equivalent in field names.  After the colon and optional whitespace
comes the contents of the field.

   <p>You can use any name you like for a header field, but normally
people use only standard field names with accepted meanings.

   <p><a name="index-user_002dfull_002dname-3848"></a><a name="index-user_002dmail_002daddress-3849"></a>  The `<samp><span class="samp">From</span></samp>' header field identifies the person sending the email
(i.e., you).  This should be a valid mailing address, as replies are
normally sent there.  The default contents of this header field are
computed from the variables <code>user-full-name</code> (which specifies
your full name) and <code>user-mail-address</code> (your email address).  On
some operating systems, Emacs initializes these two variables using
environment variables (see <a href="#General-Variables">General Variables</a>).  If this
information is unavailable or wrong, you should customize the
variables yourself (see <a href="#Easy-Customization">Easy Customization</a>).

   <p><a name="index-mail_002dfrom_002dstyle-3850"></a>  The value of the variable <code>mail-from-style</code> specifies how to
format the contents of the `<samp><span class="samp">From</span></samp>' field:

     <dl>
<dt><code>nil</code><dd>Use just the address, as in `<samp><span class="samp">king@grassland.com</span></samp>'. 
<br><dt><code>parens</code><dd>Use both address and full name, as in:<br>
`<samp><span class="samp">king@grassland.com (Elvis Parsley)</span></samp>'. 
<br><dt><code>angles</code><dd>Use both address and full name, as in:<br>
`<samp><span class="samp">Elvis Parsley &lt;king@grassland.com&gt;</span></samp>'. 
<br><dt>any other value<dd>Use <code>angles</code> normally.  But if the address must be quoted to
remain syntactically valid under the <code>angles</code> format but not
under the <code>parens</code> format, use <code>parens</code> instead.  This is
the default. 
</dl>

   <p>Apart from `<samp><span class="samp">From</span></samp>', here is a table of commonly-used fields:

     <dl>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">To</span></samp>'<dd>The mailing address(es) to which the message is addressed.  To list
more than one address, use commas to separate them.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">Subject</span></samp>'<dd>The subject of the message.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">CC</span></samp>'<dd>Additional mailing address(es) to send the message to.  This is like
`<samp><span class="samp">To</span></samp>', except that these readers should not regard the message as
directed at them.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">BCC</span></samp>'<dd>Additional mailing address(es) to send the message to, which should
not appear in the header of the message actually sent.  `<samp><span class="samp">BCC</span></samp>' stands
for <dfn>blind carbon copies</dfn>.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">FCC</span></samp>'<dd>The name of a file, to which a copy of the sent message should be
appended.  Emacs writes the message in mbox format, unless the file is
in Babyl format (used by Rmail before Emacs 23), in which case Emacs
writes in Babyl format.  If an Rmail buffer is visiting the file,
Emacs updates it accordingly.  To specify more than one file, use
several `<samp><span class="samp">FCC</span></samp>' fields, with one file name in each field.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">Reply-to</span></samp>'<dd>An address to which replies should be sent, instead of `<samp><span class="samp">From</span></samp>'. 
This is used if, for some reason, your `<samp><span class="samp">From</span></samp>' address cannot
receive replies.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">Mail-reply-to</span></samp>'<dd>This field takes precedence over `<samp><span class="samp">Reply-to</span></samp>'.  It is used because
some mailing lists set the `<samp><span class="samp">Reply-to</span></samp>' field for their own
purposes (a somewhat controversial practice).

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">Mail-followup-to</span></samp>'<dd>One of more address(es) to use as default recipient(s) for follow-up
messages.  This is typically used when you reply to a message from a
mailing list that you are subscribed to, and want replies to go to the
list without sending an extra copy to you.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">In-reply-to</span></samp>'<dd>An identifier for the message you are replying to.  Most mail readers
use this information to group related messages together.  Normally,
this header is filled in automatically when you reply to a message in
any mail program built into Emacs.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">References</span></samp>'<dd>Identifiers for previous related messages.  Like `<samp><span class="samp">In-reply-to</span></samp>',
this is normally filled in automatically for you. 
</dl>

<p class="noindent">The `<samp><span class="samp">To</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">CC</span></samp>', and `<samp><span class="samp">BCC</span></samp>' fields can appear any number
of times, and each such header field can contain multiple addresses,
separated by commas.  This way, you can specify any number of places
to send the message.  These fields can also have continuation lines:
one or more lines starting with whitespace, following the starting
line of the field, are considered part of the field.  Here's an
example of a `<samp><span class="samp">To</span></samp>' field with a continuation line:

<pre class="example">     To: foo@example.net, this@example.net,
       bob@example.com
</pre>
   <!-- There is also mail-specify-envelope-from and mail-envelope-from, but -->
<!-- these are probably not topics for the Emacs manual. -->
<p><a name="index-mail_002ddefault_002dheaders-3851"></a>  You can direct Emacs to insert certain default headers into the mail
buffer by setting the variable <code>mail-default-headers</code> to a
string.  Then <kbd>C-x m</kbd> inserts this string into the message
headers.  For example, here is how to add a `<samp><span class="samp">Reply-to</span></samp>' and
`<samp><span class="samp">FCC</span></samp>' header to each message:

<pre class="smallexample">     (setq mail-default-headers
           "Reply-to: foo@example.com\nFCC: ~/Mail/sent")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If the default header fields are not appropriate for a
particular message, edit them as necessary before sending the message.

<h3 class="section">32.3 Mail Aliases</h3>

<p><a name="index-mail-aliases-3852"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007b_002emailrc_007d-file-3853"></a><a name="index-mailrc-file-3854"></a><a name="index-mail_002dpersonal_002dalias_002dfile-3855"></a>
  You can define <dfn>mail aliases</dfn>, which are short mnemonic names
that stand for one or more mailing addresses.  By default, mail
aliases are defined in the file <samp><span class="file">~/.mailrc</span></samp>.  You can specify a
different file name to use, by setting the variable
<code>mail-personal-alias-file</code>.

   <p>To define an alias in <samp><span class="file">.mailrc</span></samp>, write a line like this:

<pre class="example">     alias <var>nick</var> <var>fulladdresses</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This means that <var>nick</var> should expand into <var>fulladdresses</var>,
where <var>fulladdresses</var> can be either a single address, or multiple
addresses separated with spaces.  For instance, to make <code>maingnu</code>
stand for <code>gnu@gnu.org</code> plus a local address of your own, put in
this line:

<pre class="example">     alias maingnu gnu@gnu.org local-gnu
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If an address contains a space, quote the whole address with a pair of
double quotes, like this:

<pre class="example">     alias jsmith "John Q. Smith &lt;none@example.com&gt;"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Note that you need not include double quotes around individual parts
of the address, such as the person's full name.  Emacs puts them in if
they are needed.  For instance, it inserts the above address as
`<samp><span class="samp">"John Q. Smith" &lt;none@example.com&gt;</span></samp>'.

   <p>Emacs also recognizes include commands in <samp><span class="file">.mailrc</span></samp>.  They
look like this:

<pre class="example">     source <var>filename</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The <samp><span class="file">.mailrc</span></samp> file is not unique to Emacs; many other
mail-reading programs use it for mail aliases, and it can contain
various other commands.  However, Emacs ignores everything except
alias definitions and include commands.

   <p><a name="index-mail_002dabbrev_002dinsert_002dalias-3856"></a>  Mail aliases expand as abbrevs&mdash;that is to say, as soon as you type
a word-separator character after an alias (see <a href="#Abbrevs">Abbrevs</a>).  This
expansion takes place only within the `<samp><span class="samp">To</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">From</span></samp>',
`<samp><span class="samp">CC</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">BCC</span></samp>', and `<samp><span class="samp">Reply-to</span></samp>' header fields (plus their
`<samp><span class="samp">Resent-</span></samp>' variants); it does not take place in other header
fields, such as `<samp><span class="samp">Subject</span></samp>'.

   <p>You can also insert an aliased address directly, using the command
<kbd>M-x mail-abbrev-insert-alias</kbd>.  This reads an alias name, with
completion, and inserts its definition at point.

  The default major mode for the <samp><span class="file">*mail*</span></samp> buffer is called
Message mode.  It behaves like Text mode in many ways, but provides
several additional commands on the <kbd>C-c</kbd> prefix, which make
editing a message more convenient.

   <p>In this section, we will describe some of the most commonly-used
commands available in Message mode. 
Message mode also has its own manual, where its features are described
in greater detail.  See <a href="message.html#Top">Message</a>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002ds-_0040r_007b_0028Message-mode_0029_007d-3859"></a><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dc-_0040r_007b_0028Message-mode_0029_007d-3860"></a><a name="index-message_002dsend-3861"></a><a name="index-message_002dkill_002dbuffer_002don_002dexit-3862"></a>  The usual command to send a message is <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>
(<code>mail-send-and-exit</code>).  This sends the message and then
buries the mail buffer, putting it at the lowest priority for
reselection.  If you want it to kill the mail buffer instead, change
the variable <code>message-kill-buffer-on-exit</code> to <code>t</code>.

   <p><a name="index-message_002dsend_002dand_002dexit-3863"></a>  The command <kbd>C-c C-s</kbd> (<code>message-send</code>) sends the message
and leaves the buffer selected.  Use this command if you want to
modify the message (perhaps with new recipients) and send it again.

   <p><a name="index-message_002dsend_002dhook-3864"></a>  Sending a message runs the hook <code>message-send-hook</code>.  It also
marks the mail buffer as unmodified, except if the mail buffer is also
a file-visiting buffer (in that case, only saving the file does that,
and you don't get a warning if you try to send the same message
twice).

   <p><a name="index-SMTP-3865"></a><a name="index-Feedmail-3866"></a><a name="index-Sendmail-3867"></a><a name="index-Mailclient-3868"></a><a name="index-send_002dmail_002dfunction-3869"></a>  The variable <code>send-mail-function</code> controls how the message is
delivered.  Its value should be one of the following functions:

     <dl>
<dt><code>sendmail-query-once</code><dd>Query for a delivery method (one of the other entries in this list),
and use that method for this message; then save the method to
<code>send-mail-function</code>, so that it is used for future deliveries. 
This is the default, unless you have already set the variables for
sending mail via <code>smtpmail-send-it</code> (see below).

     <br><dt><code>smtpmail-send-it</code><dd>Send mail through an external mail host, such as your
Internet service provider's outgoing SMTP mail server.  If you have
not told Emacs how to contact the SMTP server, it prompts for this
information, which is saved in the <code>smtpmail-smtp-server</code> variable
and the file <samp><span class="file">~/.authinfo</span></samp>. 
See <a href="smtpmail.html#Top">Emacs SMTP Library</a>.

     <br><dt><code>sendmail-send-it</code><dd>Send mail using the system's default <samp><span class="command">sendmail</span></samp> program, or
equivalent.  This requires the system to be set up for delivering mail
directly via SMTP.

     <br><dt><code>mailclient-send-it</code><dd>Pass the mail buffer on to the system's designated mail client.  See
the commentary section in the file <samp><span class="file">mailclient.el</span></samp> for details.

     <br><dt><code>feedmail-send-it</code><dd>This is similar to <code>sendmail-send-it</code>, but allows you to queue
messages for later sending.  See the commentary section in the file
<samp><span class="file">feedmail.el</span></samp> for details. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-sendmail_002dcoding_002dsystem-3870"></a>  When you send a message containing non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters,
they need to be encoded with a coding system (see <a href="#Coding-Systems">Coding Systems</a>). 
Usually the coding system is specified automatically by your chosen
language environment (see <a href="#Language-Environments">Language Environments</a>).  You can
explicitly specify the coding system for outgoing mail by setting the
variable <code>sendmail-coding-system</code> (see <a href="#Recognize-Coding">Recognize Coding</a>).  If
the coding system thus determined does not handle the characters in a
particular message, Emacs asks you to select the coding system to use,
showing a list of possible coding systems.

on the prefix <kbd>C-c C-f</kbd> (`<samp><span class="samp">C-f</span></samp>' is for &ldquo;field&rdquo;).  If the
field in question does not exist, the command creates one (the
exception is <code>mail-fcc</code>, which creates a new field each time).

   <p><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002db-_0040r_007b_0028Message-mode_0029_007d-3885"></a><a name="index-mail_002dtext-3886"></a>  The command <kbd>C-c C-b</kbd> (<code>message-goto-body</code>) moves point to
just after the header separator line&mdash;that is, to the beginning of
the body.

`<samp><span class="samp">To:</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">CC:</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">BCC:</span></samp>', you can complete an address by
typing &lt;TAB&gt; (<code>message-tab</code>).  This attempts to insert the
full name corresponding to the address based on a couple of methods,
including EUDC, a library that recognizes a number of directory server
protocols (see <a href="eudc.html#Top">EUDC</a>).  Failing that, it attempts to expand the address as a mail
alias (see <a href="#Mail-Aliases">Mail Aliases</a>).  If point is on a header field that does
not take addresses, or if it is in the message body, then &lt;TAB&gt;
just inserts a tab character.

to <dfn>cite</dfn> a message that you are replying to.  This inserts the
text of that message into the mail buffer.  This command works only if
the mail buffer is invoked from a mail reader running in Emacs, such
as Rmail.

   <p>By default, Emacs inserts the string `<samp><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>' in front of each line
of the cited text; this prefix string is specified by the variable
<code>message-yank-prefix</code>.  If you call <code>message-yank-original</code>
with a prefix argument, the citation prefix is not inserted.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dq-_0040r_007b_0028Message-mode_0029_007d-3893"></a><a name="index-mail_002dfill_002dyanked_002dmessage-3894"></a>  After using <kbd>C-c C-y</kbd>, you can type <kbd>C-c C-q</kbd>
(<code>message-fill-yanked-message</code>) to fill the paragraphs of the
cited message.  One use of <kbd>C-c C-q</kbd> fills all such paragraphs,
each one individually.  To fill a single paragraph of the quoted
message, use <kbd>M-q</kbd>.  If filling does not automatically handle the
type of citation prefix you use, try setting the fill prefix
explicitly.  See <a href="#Filling">Filling</a>.

   <p><a name="index-mail_002dcitation_002dhook-3895"></a>  You can customize mail citation through the hook
<code>mail-citation-hook</code>.  For example, you can use the Supercite
package, which provides more flexible citation
(see <a href="sc.html#Introduction">Introduction</a>).

<kbd>C-c C-a</kbd> (<code>mml-attach-file</code>) in the mail buffer.  Attaching
is done using the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
(<acronym>MIME</acronym>) standard.

   <p>The <code>mml-attach-file</code> command prompts for the name of the file,
and for the attachment's <dfn>content type</dfn>, <dfn>description</dfn>, and
<dfn>disposition</dfn>.  The content type is normally detected
automatically; just type &lt;RET&gt; to accept the default.  The
description is a single line of text that the recipient will see next
to the attachment; you may also choose to leave this empty.  The
disposition is either `<samp><span class="samp">inline</span></samp>' (the default), which means the
recipient will see a link to the attachment within the message body,
or `<samp><span class="samp">attachment</span></samp>', which means the link will be separate from the
body.

   <p><a name="index-mail_002dadd_002dattachment-3900"></a>  The <code>mml-attach-file</code> command is specific to Message mode; in
Mail mode use <kbd>mail-add-attachment</kbd> instead.  It will prompt only
for the name of the file, and will determine the content type and the
disposition automatically.  If you want to include some description of
the attached file, type that in the message body.

   <p>The actual contents of the attached file are not inserted into the
mail buffer.  Instead, some placeholder text is inserted into the mail
buffer, like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     &lt;#part type="text/plain" filename="~/foo.txt" disposition=inline&gt;
     &lt;#/part&gt;

an incoming message into the outgoing draft, this command skips what

   <p><a name="index-message_002dmode_002dhook-3902"></a><a name="index-message_002dsetup_002dhook-3903"></a>  Turning on Message mode (which <kbd>C-x m</kbd> does automatically) runs
the normal hooks <code>text-mode-hook</code> and <code>message-mode-hook</code>. 
Initializing a new outgoing message runs the normal hook
<code>message-setup-hook</code>; you can use this hook if you want to make
changes to the appearance of the mail buffer.  See <a href="#Hooks">Hooks</a>.

   <p>The main difference between these hooks is just when they are
invoked.  Whenever you type <kbd>C-x m</kbd>, <code>message-mode-hook</code> runs
as soon as the mail buffer is created.  Then the <code>message-setup</code>
function inserts the default contents of the buffer.  After these
default contents are inserted, <code>message-setup-hook</code> runs.

   <p>If you use <kbd>C-x m</kbd> to continue an existing composition,
<code>message-mode-hook</code> runs immediately after switching to the mail
buffer.  If the buffer is unmodified, or if you decide to erase it and
start again, <code>message-setup-hook</code> runs after the default contents
are inserted.

signature</dfn>&mdash;to the end of every message.  This signature may contain
information such as your telephone number or your physical location. 
The variable <code>message-signature</code> determines how Emacs handles the
mail signature.

   <p>The default value of <code>message-signature</code> is <code>t</code>; this
means to look for your mail signature in the file <samp><span class="file">~/.signature</span></samp>. 
If this file exists, its contents are automatically inserted into the
end of the mail buffer.  You can change the signature file via the
variable <code>message-signature-file</code>.

   <p>If you change <code>message-signature</code> to a string, that specifies
the text of the signature directly.

insert your mail signature automatically.  You can insert your mail
signature by typing <kbd>C-c C-w</kbd> (<code>message-insert-signature</code>) in

file.

sent are <code>mail-signature</code> and <code>mail-signature-file</code> instead.

   <p>By convention, a mail signature should be marked by a line whose
contents are `<samp><span class="samp">-- </span></samp>'.  If your signature lacks this prefix, it is
added for you.  The remainder of your signature should be no more than
four lines.

mail message.  The keywords are chosen from a list of words that suggest
you are discussing something subversive.

   <p>The idea behind this feature is the suspicion that the
NSA<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-14" name="fnd-14"><sup>14</sup></a> and other intelligence
agencies snoop on all electronic mail messages that contain keywords
suggesting they might find them interesting.  (The agencies say that
they don't, but that's what they <em>would</em> say.)  The idea is that if
lots of people add suspicious words to their messages, the agencies will
get so busy with spurious input that they will have to give up reading
it all.  Whether or not this is true, it at least amuses some people.

<a name="index-MH-mail-interface-3918"></a><a name="index-Message-mode-for-sending-mail-3919"></a>  In this chapter we have described the usual Emacs mode for editing
and sending mail&mdash;Message mode.  This is only one of several
available modes.  Prior to Emacs 23.2, the default mode was Mail mode,
which is similar to Message mode in many respects but lacks features
such as MIME support.  Another available mode is MH-E
(see <a href="mh-e.html#Top">MH-E</a>).

   <p><a name="index-mail_002duser_002dagent-3920"></a>  You can choose any of these <dfn>mail user agents</dfn> as your preferred
method for editing and sending mail.  The commands <code>C-x m</code>,
<code>C-x 4 m</code> and <code>C-x 5 m</code> use whichever agent you have
specified; so do various other parts of Emacs that send mail, such as
the bug reporter (see <a href="#Bugs">Bugs</a>).  To specify a mail user agent,
customize the variable <code>mail-user-agent</code>.  Currently, legitimate
values include <code>message-user-agent</code> (Message mode)
<code>sendmail-user-agent</code> (Mail mode), <code>gnus-user-agent</code>, and
<code>mh-e-user-agent</code>.

   <p>If you select a different mail-composition method, the information
in this chapter about the mail buffer and Message mode does not apply;
the other methods use a different format of text in a different
buffer, and their commands are different as well.

   <p><a name="index-read_002dmail_002dcommand-3921"></a>  Similarly, to specify your preferred method for reading mail,
customize the variable <code>read-mail-command</code>.  The default is
<code>rmail</code> (see <a href="#Rmail">Rmail</a>).

  Rmail is an Emacs subsystem for reading and disposing of mail that
you receive.  Rmail stores mail messages in files called Rmail files. 
Reading the messages in an Rmail file is done in a special major mode,
Rmail mode, which redefines most letters to run commands for managing mail.

<h3 class="section">33.1 Basic Concepts of Rmail</h3>

<p><a name="index-primary-Rmail-file-3927"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dfile_002dname-3928"></a>  Using Rmail in the simplest fashion, you have one Rmail file
<samp><span class="file">~/RMAIL</span></samp> in which all of your mail is saved.  It is called your
<dfn>primary Rmail file</dfn>.  The command <kbd>M-x rmail</kbd> reads your primary
Rmail file, merges new mail in from your inboxes, displays the first
message you haven't read yet, and lets you begin reading.  The variable
<code>rmail-file-name</code> specifies the name of the primary Rmail file.

   <p>Rmail displays only one message in the Rmail file at a time. 
The message that is shown is called the <dfn>current message</dfn>.  Rmail
mode's special commands can do such things as delete the current
message, copy it into another file, send a reply, or move to another
message.  You can also create multiple Rmail files and use Rmail to move
messages between them.

   <p><a name="index-message-number-3929"></a>  Within the Rmail file, messages are normally arranged sequentially in
order of receipt; you can specify other ways to sort them (see <a href="#Rmail-Sorting">Rmail Sorting</a>).  Messages are identified by consecutive integers which are
their <dfn>message numbers</dfn>.  The number of the current message is
displayed in Rmail's mode line, followed by the total number of messages
in the file.  You can move to a message by specifying its message number
with the <kbd>j</kbd> key (see <a href="#Rmail-Motion">Rmail Motion</a>).

   <p><a name="index-s-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-3930"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dexpunge_002dand_002dsave-3931"></a>  Following the usual conventions of Emacs, changes in an Rmail file
become permanent only when you save the file.  You can save it with
<kbd>s</kbd> (<code>rmail-expunge-and-save</code>), which also expunges deleted
messages from the file first (see <a href="#Rmail-Deletion">Rmail Deletion</a>).  To save the
file without expunging, use <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd>.  Rmail also saves the Rmail
file after merging new mail from an inbox file (see <a href="#Rmail-Inbox">Rmail Inbox</a>).

   <p><a name="index-q-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-3932"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dquit-3933"></a><a name="index-b-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-3934"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dbury-3935"></a>  You can exit Rmail with <kbd>q</kbd> (<code>rmail-quit</code>); this expunges
and saves the Rmail file, then buries the Rmail buffer as well as its
summary buffer, if present (see <a href="#Rmail-Summary">Rmail Summary</a>).  But there is no
need to exit formally.  If you switch from Rmail to editing in
other buffers, and never switch back, you have exited.  Just make sure
to save the Rmail file eventually (like any other file you have
changed).  <kbd>C-x s</kbd> is a suitable way to do this (see <a href="#Save-Commands">Save Commands</a>).  The Rmail command <kbd>b</kbd>, <code>rmail-bury</code>, buries the
Rmail buffer and its summary without expunging and saving the Rmail file.

<h3 class="section">33.2 Scrolling Within a Message</h3>

<p>When Rmail displays a message that does not fit on the screen, you
must scroll through it to read the rest.  You could do this with
<kbd>C-v</kbd>, <kbd>M-v</kbd> and <kbd>M-&lt;</kbd>, but in Rmail scrolling is so
frequent that it deserves to be easier.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd><dd>Scroll forward (<code>scroll-up-command</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd><dt><kbd>S-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd><dd>Scroll backward (<code>scroll-down-command</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>.</kbd><dd>Scroll to start of message (<code>rmail-beginning-of-message</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>/</kbd><dd>Scroll to end of message (<code>rmail-end-of-message</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-SPC-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-3936"></a><a name="index-DEL-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-3937"></a><a name="index-S_002dSPC-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-3938"></a>  Since the most common thing to do while reading a message is to
scroll through it by screenfuls, Rmail makes &lt;SPC&gt; and &lt;DEL&gt;
(or <kbd>S-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>) do the same as <kbd>C-v</kbd> (<code>scroll-up-command</code>)
and <kbd>M-v</kbd> (<code>scroll-down-command</code>) respectively.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_002e-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-3939"></a><a name="index-g_t_002f-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-3940"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dbeginning_002dof_002dmessage-3941"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dend_002dof_002dmessage-3942"></a>  The command <kbd>.</kbd> (<code>rmail-beginning-of-message</code>) scrolls back to the
beginning of the selected message.  This is not quite the same as <kbd>M-&lt;</kbd>:
for one thing, it does not set the mark; for another, it resets the buffer
boundaries of the current message if you have changed them.  Similarly,
the command <kbd>/</kbd> (<code>rmail-end-of-message</code>) scrolls forward to the end
of the selected message. 
<!-- The comment about buffer boundaries is still true in mbox Rmail, if -->
<!-- less likely to be relevant. -->

<h3 class="section">33.3 Moving Among Messages</h3>

<p>The most basic thing to do with a message is to read it.  The way to
do this in Rmail is to make the message current.  The usual practice is
to move sequentially through the file, since this is the order of
receipt of messages.  When you enter Rmail, you are positioned at the
first message that you have not yet made current (that is, the first one
that has the `<samp><span class="samp">unseen</span></samp>' attribute; see <a href="#Rmail-Attributes">Rmail Attributes</a>).  Move
forward to see the other new messages; move backward to re-examine old
messages.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>n</kbd><dd>Move to the next nondeleted message, skipping any intervening deleted
messages (<code>rmail-next-undeleted-message</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>p</kbd><dd>Move to the previous nondeleted message
(<code>rmail-previous-undeleted-message</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-n</kbd><dd>Move to the next message, including deleted messages
(<code>rmail-next-message</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-p</kbd><dd>Move to the previous message, including deleted messages
(<code>rmail-previous-message</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-c C-n</kbd><dd>Move to the next message with the same subject as the current one
(<code>rmail-next-same-subject</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-c C-p</kbd><dd>Move to the previous message with the same subject as the current one
(<code>rmail-previous-same-subject</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>j</kbd><dd>Move to the first message.  With argument <var>n</var>, move to
message number <var>n</var> (<code>rmail-show-message</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>&gt;</kbd><dd>Move to the last message (<code>rmail-last-message</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>&lt;</kbd><dd>Move to the first message (<code>rmail-first-message</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>M-s </kbd><var>regexp</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Move to the next message containing a match for <var>regexp</var>
(<code>rmail-search</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>- M-s </kbd><var>regexp</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Move to the previous message containing a match for <var>regexp</var>. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-n-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-3943"></a><a name="index-p-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-3944"></a><a name="index-M_002dn-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-3945"></a><a name="index-M_002dp-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-3946"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dnext_002dundeleted_002dmessage-3947"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dprevious_002dundeleted_002dmessage-3948"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dnext_002dmessage-3949"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dprevious_002dmessage-3950"></a>  <kbd>n</kbd> and <kbd>p</kbd> are the usual way of moving among messages in
Rmail.  They move through the messages sequentially, but skip over
deleted messages, which is usually what you want to do.  Their command
definitions are named <code>rmail-next-undeleted-message</code> and
<code>rmail-previous-undeleted-message</code>.  If you do not want to skip
deleted messages&mdash;for example, if you want to move to a message to
undelete it&mdash;use the variants <kbd>M-n</kbd> and <kbd>M-p</kbd>
(<code>rmail-next-message</code> and <code>rmail-previous-message</code>).  A
numeric argument to any of these commands serves as a repeat
count.

   <p>In Rmail, you can specify a numeric argument by typing just the
digits.  You don't need to type <kbd>C-u</kbd> first.

   <p><a name="index-M_002ds-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-3951"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dsearch-3952"></a><a name="index-searching-in-Rmail-3953"></a>  The <kbd>M-s</kbd> (<code>rmail-search</code>) command is Rmail's version of
search.  The usual incremental search command <kbd>C-s</kbd> works in Rmail,
but it searches only within the current message.  The purpose of
<kbd>M-s</kbd> is to search for another message.  It reads a regular
expression (see <a href="#Regexps">Regexps</a>) nonincrementally, then searches starting at
the beginning of the following message for a match.  It then selects
that message.  If <var>regexp</var> is empty, <kbd>M-s</kbd> reuses the regexp
used the previous time.

   <p>To search backward in the file for another message, give <kbd>M-s</kbd> a
negative argument.  In Rmail you can do this with <kbd>- M-s</kbd>.  This
begins searching from the end of the previous message.

   <p>It is also possible to search for a message based on labels. 
See <a href="#Rmail-Labels">Rmail Labels</a>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dn-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-3954"></a><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dp-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-3955"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dnext_002dsame_002dsubject-3956"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dprevious_002dsame_002dsubject-3957"></a>  The <kbd>C-c C-n</kbd> (<code>rmail-next-same-subject</code>) command moves to
the next message with the same subject as the current one.  A prefix
argument serves as a repeat count.  With a negative argument, this
command moves backward, acting like <kbd>C-c C-p</kbd>
(<code>rmail-previous-same-subject</code>).  When comparing subjects, these
commands ignore the prefixes typically added to the subjects of replies.

   <p><a name="index-j-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-3958"></a><a name="index-g_t_003e-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-3959"></a><a name="index-g_t_003c-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-3960"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dshow_002dmessage-3961"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dlast_002dmessage-3962"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dfirst_002dmessage-3963"></a>  To move to a message specified by absolute message number, use <kbd>j</kbd>
(<code>rmail-show-message</code>) with the message number as argument.  With
no argument, <kbd>j</kbd> selects the first message.  <kbd>&lt;</kbd>
(<code>rmail-first-message</code>) also selects the first message.  <kbd>&gt;</kbd>
(<code>rmail-last-message</code>) selects the last message.

flags it as ignorable, and some Rmail commands pretend it is no longer
present; but it still has its place in the Rmail file, and still has its
message number.

   <p><a name="index-expunging-_0028Rmail_0029-3965"></a>  <dfn>Expunging</dfn> the Rmail file actually removes the deleted messages. 
The remaining messages are renumbered consecutively. 
<!-- The following is neither true (there is also unforward, sorting, -->
<!-- etc), nor especially interesting. -->
<!-- Expunging is the only action that changes the message number of any -->
<!-- message, except for undigestifying (@pxref{Rmail Digest}). -->

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>d</kbd><dd>Delete the current message, and move to the next nondeleted message
(<code>rmail-delete-forward</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-d</kbd><dd>Delete the current message, and move to the previous nondeleted
message (<code>rmail-delete-backward</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>u</kbd><dd>Undelete the current message, or move back to the previous deleted
message and undelete it (<code>rmail-undelete-previous-message</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>x</kbd><dd>Expunge the Rmail file (<code>rmail-expunge</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-d-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-3966"></a><a name="index-C_002dd-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-3967"></a><a name="index-rmail_002ddelete_002dforward-3968"></a><a name="index-rmail_002ddelete_002dbackward-3969"></a>  There are two Rmail commands for deleting messages.  Both delete the
current message and select another.  <kbd>d</kbd>
(<code>rmail-delete-forward</code>) moves to the following message, skipping
messages already deleted, while <kbd>C-d</kbd> (<code>rmail-delete-backward</code>)
moves to the previous nondeleted message.  If there is no nondeleted
message to move to in the specified direction, the message that was just
deleted remains current.  A numeric prefix argument serves as a repeat
count, to allow deletion of several messages in a single command.  A
negative argument reverses the meaning of <kbd>d</kbd> and <kbd>C-d</kbd>.

<!-- mention other hooks, e.g., show message hook? -->
<p><a name="index-rmail_002ddelete_002dmessage_002dhook-3970"></a>  Whenever Rmail deletes a message, it runs the hook
<code>rmail-delete-message-hook</code>.  When the hook functions are invoked,
the message has been marked deleted, but it is still the current message
in the Rmail buffer.

   <p><a name="index-undeletion-_0028Rmail_0029-3971"></a><a name="index-x-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-3972"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dexpunge-3973"></a><a name="index-u-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-3974"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dundelete_002dprevious_002dmessage-3975"></a>  To make all the deleted messages finally vanish from the Rmail file,
type <kbd>x</kbd> (<code>rmail-expunge</code>).  Until you do this, you can still
<dfn>undelete</dfn> the deleted messages.  The undeletion command, <kbd>u</kbd>
(<code>rmail-undelete-previous-message</code>), is designed to cancel the
effect of a <kbd>d</kbd> command in most cases.  It undeletes the current
message if the current message is deleted.  Otherwise it moves backward
to previous messages until a deleted message is found, and undeletes
that message.  A numeric prefix argument serves as a repeat count, to
allow deletion of several messages in a single command.

   <p>You can usually undo a <kbd>d</kbd> with a <kbd>u</kbd> because the <kbd>u</kbd>
moves back to and undeletes the message that the <kbd>d</kbd> deleted.  But
this does not work when the <kbd>d</kbd> skips a few already-deleted messages
that follow the message being deleted; then the <kbd>u</kbd> command
undeletes the last of the messages that were skipped.  There is no clean
way to avoid this problem.  However, by repeating the <kbd>u</kbd> command,
you can eventually get back to the message that you intend to
undelete.  You can also select a particular deleted message with
the <kbd>M-p</kbd> command, then type <kbd>u</kbd> to undelete it.

   <p>A deleted message has the `<samp><span class="samp">deleted</span></samp>' attribute, and as a result
`<samp><span class="samp">deleted</span></samp>' appears in the mode line when the current message is
deleted.  In fact, deleting or undeleting a message is nothing more than
adding or removing this attribute.  See <a href="#Rmail-Attributes">Rmail Attributes</a>.

<h3 class="section">33.5 Rmail Files and Inboxes</h3>

<p><a name="index-inbox-file-3976"></a>
  When you receive mail locally, the operating system places incoming
mail for you in a file that we call your <dfn>inbox</dfn>.  When you start
up Rmail, it runs a C program called <code>movemail</code> to copy the new
messages from your local inbox into your primary Rmail file, which
also contains other messages saved from previous Rmail sessions.  It
is in this file that you actually read the mail with Rmail.  This
operation is called <dfn>getting new mail</dfn>.  You can get new mail at
any time in Rmail by typing <kbd>g</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-rmail_002dprimary_002dinbox_002dlist-3977"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040env_007bMAIL_007d-environment-variable-3978"></a>  The variable <code>rmail-primary-inbox-list</code> contains a list of the
files that are inboxes for your primary Rmail file.  If you don't set
this variable explicitly, Rmail uses the <samp><span class="env">MAIL</span></samp> environment
variable, or, as a last resort, a default inbox based on
<code>rmail-spool-directory</code>.  The default inbox file depends on your
operating system; often it is <samp><span class="file">/var/mail/</span><var>username</var></samp>,
<samp><span class="file">/var/spool/mail/</span><var>username</var></samp>, or
<samp><span class="file">/usr/spool/mail/</span><var>username</var></samp>.

   <p>You can specify the inbox file(s) for any Rmail file for the current
session with the command <code>set-rmail-inbox-list</code>; see <a href="#Rmail-Files">Rmail Files</a>.

   <p>There are two reasons for having separate Rmail files and inboxes.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>The inbox file format varies between operating systems and according to
the other mail software in use.  Only one part of Rmail needs to know
about the alternatives, and it need only understand how to convert all
of them to Rmail's own format.

     <li>It is very cumbersome to access an inbox file without danger of losing
mail, because it is necessary to interlock with mail delivery. 
Moreover, different operating systems use different interlocking
techniques.  The strategy of moving mail out of the inbox once and for
all into a separate Rmail file avoids the need for interlocking in all
the rest of Rmail, since only Rmail operates on the Rmail file.
        </ol>

<!-- FIXME remove this in Emacs 25; won't be relevant any more. -->
<p><a name="index-Babyl-files-3979"></a><a name="index-mbox-files-3980"></a>  Rmail was originally written to use the Babyl format as its internal
format.  Since then, we have recognized that the usual inbox format
(`<samp><span class="samp">mbox</span></samp>') on Unix and GNU systems is adequate for the job, and so
since Emacs 23 Rmail uses that as its internal format.  The Rmail file
is still separate from the inbox file, even though their format is the
same. 
<!-- But this bit should stay in some form. -->
<a name="index-rmail_002dmbox_002dformat-3981"></a>(In fact, there are a few slightly different mbox formats. 
The differences are not very important, but you can set the variable
<code>rmail-mbox-format</code> to tell Rmail which form your system uses. 
See that variable's documentation for more details.)

   <p><a name="index-rmail_002dpreserve_002dinbox-3982"></a>  When getting new mail, Rmail first copies the new mail from the
inbox file to the Rmail file; then it saves the Rmail file; then it
clears out the inbox file.  This way, a system crash may cause
duplication of mail between the inbox and the Rmail file, but cannot
lose mail.  If <code>rmail-preserve-inbox</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, then
Rmail does not clear out the inbox file when it gets new mail.  You
may wish to set this, for example, on a portable computer you use to
check your mail via POP while traveling, so that your mail will remain
on the server and you can save it later on your workstation.

   <p>In some cases, Rmail copies the new mail from the inbox file
indirectly.  First it runs the <code>movemail</code> program to move the mail
from the inbox to an intermediate file called
<samp><span class="file">.newmail-</span><var>inboxname</var></samp>, in the same directory as the Rmail
file.  Then Rmail merges the new mail from that file, saves the Rmail
file, and only then deletes the intermediate file.  If there is a crash
at the wrong time, this file continues to exist, and Rmail will use it
again the next time it gets new mail from that inbox.

   <p>If Rmail is unable to convert the data in
<samp><span class="file">.newmail-</span><var>inboxname</var></samp> into mbox format, it renames the file to
<samp><span class="file">RMAILOSE.</span><var>n</var></samp> (<var>n</var> is an integer chosen to make the name
unique) so that Rmail will not have trouble with the data again.  You
should look at the file, find whatever message confuses Rmail (probably
one that includes the control-underscore character, octal code 037), and
delete it.  Then you can use <kbd>1 g</kbd> to get new mail from the
corrected file.

<h3 class="section">33.6 Multiple Rmail Files</h3>

<p>Rmail operates by default on your <dfn>primary Rmail file</dfn>, which is named
<samp><span class="file">~/RMAIL</span></samp> and receives your incoming mail from your system inbox file. 
But you can also have other Rmail files and edit them with Rmail.  These
files can receive mail through their own inboxes, or you can move messages
into them with explicit Rmail commands (see <a href="#Rmail-Output">Rmail Output</a>).

     <dl>

   <p><a name="index-i-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-3983"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dinput-3984"></a>  To run Rmail on a file other than your primary Rmail file, you can use
the <kbd>i</kbd> (<code>rmail-input</code>) command in Rmail.  This visits the file
in Rmail mode.  You can use <kbd>M-x rmail-input</kbd> even when not in
Rmail, but it is easier to type <kbd>C-u M-x rmail</kbd>, which does the
same thing.

   <p>The file you read with <kbd>i</kbd> should normally be a valid mbox file. 
If it is not, Rmail tries to convert its text to mbox format, and
visits the converted text in the buffer.  If you save the buffer, that
converts the file.

   <p>If you specify a file name that doesn't exist, <kbd>i</kbd> initializes a
new buffer for creating a new Rmail file.

   <p><a name="index-rmail_002dsecondary_002dfile_002ddirectory-3985"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dsecondary_002dfile_002dregexp-3986"></a>  You can also select an Rmail file from a menu.  In the Classify menu,
choose the Input Rmail File item; then choose the Rmail file you want. 
The variables <code>rmail-secondary-file-directory</code> and
<code>rmail-secondary-file-regexp</code> specify which files to offer in the
menu: the first variable says which directory to find them in; the
second says which files in that directory to offer (all those that match
the regular expression).  If no files match, you cannot select this menu
item.  These variables also apply to choosing a file for output
(see <a href="#Rmail-Output">Rmail Output</a>). 
<!-- FIXME matches only checked when Rmail file first visited? -->

   <p><a name="index-rmail_002dinbox_002dlist-3987"></a>  The inbox files to use are specified by the variable
<code>rmail-inbox-list</code>, which is buffer-local in Rmail mode.  As a
special exception, if you have specified no inbox files for your primary
Rmail file, it uses the <samp><span class="env">MAIL</span></samp> environment variable, or your
standard system inbox.

   <p><a name="index-g-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-3988"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dget_002dnew_002dmail-3989"></a>  The <kbd>g</kbd> command (<code>rmail-get-new-mail</code>) merges mail into the
current Rmail file from its inboxes.  If the Rmail file has no
inboxes, <kbd>g</kbd> does nothing.  The command <kbd>M-x rmail</kbd> also
merges new mail into your primary Rmail file.

   <p>To merge mail from a file that is not the usual inbox, give the
<kbd>g</kbd> key a numeric argument, as in <kbd>C-u g</kbd>.  Then it reads a file
name and merges mail from that file.  The inbox file is not deleted or
changed in any way when <kbd>g</kbd> with an argument is used.  This is,
therefore, a general way of merging one file of messages into another.

<h3 class="section">33.7 Copying Messages Out to Files</h3>

<p>These commands copy messages from an Rmail file into another file.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>o </kbd><var>file</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Append a full copy of the current message to the file <var>file</var>
(<code>rmail-output</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>w </kbd><var>file</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Output just the message body to the file <var>file</var>, taking the default
file name from the message `<samp><span class="samp">Subject</span></samp>' header. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-o-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-3990"></a><a name="index-rmail_002doutput_002das_002dseen-3991"></a><a name="index-C_002do-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-3992"></a><a name="index-rmail_002doutput-3993"></a>  The commands <kbd>o</kbd> and <kbd>C-o</kbd> copy the current message into a
specified file, adding it at the end.  The two commands differ mainly
in how much to copy: <kbd>o</kbd> copies the full message headers, even if
they are not all visible, while <kbd>C-o</kbd> copies exactly the headers
currently displayed and no more.  See <a href="#Rmail-Display">Rmail Display</a>.  In addition,
<kbd>o</kbd> converts the message to Babyl format (used by Rmail in Emacs
version 22 and before) if the file is in Babyl format; <kbd>C-o</kbd>
cannot output to Babyl files at all. 
<!-- FIXME remove BABYL mention in Emacs 25? -->

   <p>If the output file is currently visited in an Emacs buffer, the
output commands append the message to that buffer.  It is up to you to
save the buffer eventually in its file.

   <p><a name="index-w-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-3994"></a><a name="index-rmail_002doutput_002dbody_002dto_002dfile-3995"></a>  Sometimes you may receive a message whose body holds the contents of a
file.  You can save the body to a file (excluding the message header)
with the <kbd>w</kbd> command (<code>rmail-output-body-to-file</code>).  Often
these messages contain the intended file name in the `<samp><span class="samp">Subject</span></samp>'
field, so the <kbd>w</kbd> command uses the `<samp><span class="samp">Subject</span></samp>' field as the
default for the output file name.  However, the file name is read using
the minibuffer, so you can specify a different name if you wish.

   <p>You can also output a message to an Rmail file chosen with a menu. 
In the Classify menu, choose the Output Rmail File menu item; then
choose the Rmail file you want.  This outputs the current message to
that file, like the <kbd>o</kbd> command.  The variables
<code>rmail-secondary-file-directory</code> and
<code>rmail-secondary-file-regexp</code> specify which files to offer in the
menu: the first variable says which directory to find them in; the
second says which files in that directory to offer (all those that
match the regular expression).  If no files match, you cannot select
this menu item.

   <p><a name="index-rmail_002ddelete_002dafter_002doutput-3996"></a>  Copying a message with <kbd>o</kbd> or <kbd>C-o</kbd> gives the original copy
of the message the `<samp><span class="samp">filed</span></samp>' attribute, so that `<samp><span class="samp">filed</span></samp>'
appears in the mode line when such a message is current.

   <p>If you like to keep just a single copy of every mail message, set
the variable <code>rmail-delete-after-output</code> to <code>t</code>; then the
<kbd>o</kbd>, <kbd>C-o</kbd> and <kbd>w</kbd> commands delete the original message
after copying it.  (You can undelete it afterward if you wish.)

   <p><a name="index-rmail_002doutput_002dfile_002dalist-3997"></a>  The variable <code>rmail-output-file-alist</code> lets you specify
intelligent defaults for the output file, based on the contents of the
current message.  The value should be a list whose elements have this
form:

<pre class="example">     (<var>regexp</var> . <var>name-exp</var>)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If there's a match for <var>regexp</var> in the current message, then the
default file name for output is <var>name-exp</var>.  If multiple elements
match the message, the first matching element decides the default file
name.  The subexpression <var>name-exp</var> may be a string constant giving
the file name to use, or more generally it may be any Lisp expression
that returns a file name as a string.  <code>rmail-output-file-alist</code>
applies to both <kbd>o</kbd> and <kbd>C-o</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-rmail_002dautomatic_002dfolder_002ddirectives-3998"></a>Rmail can automatically save messages from your primary Rmail file
(the one that <code>rmail-file-name</code> specifies) to other files, based
on the value of the variable <code>rmail-automatic-folder-directives</code>. 
This variable is a list of elements (`<samp><span class="samp">directives</span></samp>') that say which
messages to save where.  Each directive is a list consisting of an
output file, followed by one or more pairs of a header name and a regular
expression.  If a message has a header matching the specified regular
expression, that message is saved to the given file.  If the directive
has more than one header entry, all must match.  Rmail checks directives
when it shows a message from the file <code>rmail-file-name</code>, and
applies the first that matches (if any).  If the output file is
<code>nil</code>, the message is deleted, not saved.  For example, you can use
this feature to save messages from a particular address, or with a
particular subject, to a dedicated file.

<p><a name="index-label-_0028Rmail_0029-3999"></a><a name="index-attribute-_0028Rmail_0029-4000"></a>
  Each message can have various <dfn>labels</dfn> assigned to it as a means
of classification.  Each label has a name; different names are different
labels.  Any given label is either present or absent on a particular
message.  A few label names have standard meanings and are given to
messages automatically by Rmail when appropriate; these special labels
are called <dfn>attributes</dfn>. 
(See <a href="#Rmail-Attributes">Rmail Attributes</a>.) 
All other labels are assigned only by users.

     <dl>

(<code>rmail-kill-label</code>) commands allow you to assign or remove any
label on the current message.  If the <var>label</var> argument is empty, it
means to assign or remove the same label most recently assigned or
removed.

   <p>Once you have given messages labels to classify them as you wish, there
are three ways to use the labels: in moving, in summaries, and in sorting.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dM_002dn-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-4005"></a><a name="index-C_002dM_002dp-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-4006"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dnext_002dlabeled_002dmessage-4007"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dprevious_002dlabeled_002dmessage-4008"></a>  <kbd>C-M-n </kbd><var>labels</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
(<code>rmail-next-labeled-message</code>) moves to the next message that has
one of the labels <var>labels</var>.  The argument <var>labels</var> specifies
one or more label names, separated by commas.  <kbd>C-M-p</kbd>
(<code>rmail-previous-labeled-message</code>) is similar, but moves
backwards to previous messages.  A numeric argument to either command
serves as a repeat count.

   <p>The command <kbd>C-M-l </kbd><var>labels</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
(<code>rmail-summary-by-labels</code>) displays a summary containing only the
messages that have at least one of a specified set of labels.  The
argument <var>labels</var> is one or more label names, separated by commas. 
See <a href="#Rmail-Summary">Rmail Summary</a>, for information on summaries.

   <p>If the <var>labels</var> argument to <kbd>C-M-n</kbd>, <kbd>C-M-p</kbd> or
<kbd>C-M-l</kbd> is empty, it means to use the last set of labels specified
for any of these commands.

<p>Some labels such as `<samp><span class="samp">deleted</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">filed</span></samp>' have built-in
meanings, and Rmail assigns them to messages automatically at
appropriate times; these labels are called <dfn>attributes</dfn>.  Here is
a list of Rmail attributes:

     <dl>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">unseen</span></samp>'<dd>Means the message has never been current.  Assigned to messages when
they come from an inbox file, and removed when a message is made
current.  When you start Rmail, it initially shows the first message
that has this attribute. 
<br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">deleted</span></samp>'<dd>Means the message is deleted.  Assigned by deletion commands and
removed by undeletion commands (see <a href="#Rmail-Deletion">Rmail Deletion</a>). 
<br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">filed</span></samp>'<dd>Means the message has been copied to some other file.  Assigned by the
<kbd>o</kbd> and <kbd>C-o</kbd> file output commands (see <a href="#Rmail-Output">Rmail Output</a>). 
<br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">answered</span></samp>'<dd>Means you have mailed an answer to the message.  Assigned by the <kbd>r</kbd>
command (<code>rmail-reply</code>).  See <a href="#Rmail-Reply">Rmail Reply</a>. 
<br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">forwarded</span></samp>'<dd>Means you have forwarded the message.  Assigned by the <kbd>f</kbd> command
(<code>rmail-forward</code>).  See <a href="#Rmail-Reply">Rmail Reply</a>. 
<br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">edited</span></samp>'<dd>Means you have edited the text of the message within Rmail. 
See <a href="#Rmail-Editing">Rmail Editing</a>. 
<br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">resent</span></samp>'<dd>Means you have resent the message.  Assigned by the command <kbd>M-x
rmail-resend</kbd>.  See <a href="#Rmail-Reply">Rmail Reply</a>. 
<br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">retried</span></samp>'<dd>Means you have retried a failed outgoing message.  Assigned by the
command <kbd>M-x rmail-retry-failure</kbd>.  See <a href="#Rmail-Reply">Rmail Reply</a>. 
</dl>

   <p>All other labels are assigned or removed only by users, and have no
standard meaning.

<h3 class="section">33.10 Sending Replies</h3>

<p>Rmail has several commands to send outgoing mail.  See <a href="#Sending-Mail">Sending Mail</a>, for information on using Message mode, including certain
features meant to work with Rmail.  What this section documents are
the special commands of Rmail for entering the mail buffer.  Note that
the usual keys for sending mail&mdash;<kbd>C-x m</kbd>, <kbd>C-x 4 m</kbd>, and
<kbd>C-x 5 m</kbd>&mdash;also work normally in Rmail mode.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>m</kbd><dd>Send a message (<code>rmail-mail</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>c</kbd><dd>Continue editing the already started outgoing message (<code>rmail-continue</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>r</kbd><dd>Send a reply to the current Rmail message (<code>rmail-reply</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>f</kbd><dd>Forward the current message to other users (<code>rmail-forward</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-u f</kbd><dd>Resend the current message to other users (<code>rmail-resend</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-m</kbd><dd>Try sending a bounced message a second time (<code>rmail-retry-failure</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-r-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-4009"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dreply-4010"></a><a name="index-reply-to-a-message-4011"></a>  The most common reason to send a message while in Rmail is to reply
to the message you are reading.  To do this, type <kbd>r</kbd>
(<code>rmail-reply</code>).  This displays a mail composition buffer in
another window, much like <kbd>C-x 4 m</kbd>, but preinitializes the
`<samp><span class="samp">Subject</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">To</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">CC</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">In-reply-to</span></samp>' and
`<samp><span class="samp">References</span></samp>' header fields based on the message you are replying
to.  The `<samp><span class="samp">To</span></samp>' field starts out as the address of the person who
sent the message you received, and the `<samp><span class="samp">CC</span></samp>' field starts out with
all the other recipients of that message.

   <p><a name="index-mail_002ddont_002dreply_002dto_002dnames-4012"></a>  You can exclude certain recipients from being included automatically
in replies, using the variable <code>mail-dont-reply-to-names</code>.  Its
value should be a regular expression; any recipients that match are
excluded from the `<samp><span class="samp">CC</span></samp>' field.  They are also excluded from the
`<samp><span class="samp">To</span></samp>' field, unless this would leave the field empty.  If this
variable is <code>nil</code>, then the first time you compose a reply it is
initialized to a default value that matches your own address.

   <p>To omit the `<samp><span class="samp">CC</span></samp>' field completely for a particular reply, enter
the reply command with a numeric argument: <kbd>C-u r</kbd> or <kbd>1 r</kbd>. 
This means to reply only to the sender of the original message.

   <p>Once the mail composition buffer has been initialized, editing and
sending the mail goes as usual (see <a href="#Sending-Mail">Sending Mail</a>).  You can edit
the presupplied header fields if they are not what you want.  You can
also use commands such as <kbd>C-c C-y</kbd>, which yanks in the message
that you are replying to (see <a href="#Mail-Commands">Mail Commands</a>).  You can also switch
to the Rmail buffer, select a different message there, switch back,
and yank the new current message.

   <p><a name="index-M_002dm-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-4013"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dretry_002dfailure-4014"></a><a name="index-retrying-a-failed-message-4015"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dretry_002dignored_002dheaders-4016"></a>  Sometimes a message does not reach its destination.  Mailers usually
send the failed message back to you, enclosed in a <dfn>failure
message</dfn>.  The Rmail command <kbd>M-m</kbd> (<code>rmail-retry-failure</code>)
prepares to send the same message a second time: it sets up a
mail composition buffer with the same text and header fields as before.  If
you type <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> right away, you send the message again exactly
the same as the first time.  Alternatively, you can edit the text or
headers and then send it.  The variable
<code>rmail-retry-ignored-headers</code>, in the same format as
<code>rmail-ignored-headers</code> (see <a href="#Rmail-Display">Rmail Display</a>), controls which
headers are stripped from the failed message when retrying it.

   <p><a name="index-f-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-4017"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dforward-4018"></a><a name="index-forwarding-a-message-4019"></a>  Another frequent reason to send mail in Rmail is to <dfn>forward</dfn> the
current message to other users.  <kbd>f</kbd> (<code>rmail-forward</code>) makes
this easy by preinitializing the mail composition buffer with the current
message as the text, and a subject of the form <code>[</code><var>from</var><code>:
</code><var>subject</var><code>]</code>, where <var>from</var> and <var>subject</var> are the sender and
subject of the original message.  All you have to do is fill in the
recipients and send.  When you forward a message, recipients get a
message which is from you, and which has the original message in
its contents.

   <p><a name="index-rmail_002denable_002dmime_002dcomposing-4020"></a><a name="index-unforward_002drmail_002dmessage-4021"></a>  Rmail offers two formats for forwarded messages.  The default is to
use MIME (see <a href="#Rmail-Display">Rmail Display</a>) format.  This includes the original
message as a separate part.  You can use a simpler format if you
prefer, by setting the variable <code>rmail-enable-mime-composing</code> to
<code>nil</code>.  In this case, Rmail just includes the original message
enclosed between two delimiter lines.  It also modifies every line
that starts with a dash, by inserting `<samp><span class="samp">-&nbsp;</span></samp>'<!-- /@w --> at the start of
the line.  When you receive a forwarded message in this format, if it
contains something besides ordinary text&mdash;for example, program source
code&mdash;you might find it useful to undo that transformation.  You can
do this by selecting the forwarded message and typing <kbd>M-x
unforward-rmail-message</kbd>.  This command extracts the original
forwarded message, deleting the inserted `<samp><span class="samp">-&nbsp;</span></samp>'<!-- /@w --> strings, and
inserts it into the Rmail file as a separate message immediately
following the current one.

   <p><a name="index-rmail_002dresend-4022"></a>  <dfn>Resending</dfn> is an alternative similar to forwarding; the
difference is that resending sends a message that is from the
original sender, just as it reached you&mdash;with a few added header fields
(`<samp><span class="samp">Resent-From</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">Resent-To</span></samp>') to indicate that it came via
you.  To resend a message in Rmail, use <kbd>C-u f</kbd>.  (<kbd>f</kbd> runs
<code>rmail-forward</code>, which invokes <code>rmail-resend</code> if you provide a
numeric argument.)

   <p><a name="index-m-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-4023"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dmail-4024"></a>  Use the <kbd>m</kbd> (<code>rmail-mail</code>) command to start editing an
outgoing message that is not a reply.  It leaves the header fields empty. 
Its only difference from <kbd>C-x 4 m</kbd> is that it makes the Rmail buffer
accessible for <kbd>C-c C-y</kbd>, just as <kbd>r</kbd> does.

   <p><a name="index-c-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-4025"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dcontinue-4026"></a>  The <kbd>c</kbd> (<code>rmail-continue</code>) command resumes editing the
mail composition buffer, to finish editing an outgoing message you were
already composing, or to alter a message you have sent.

   <p><a name="index-rmail_002dmail_002dnew_002dframe-4027"></a>  If you set the variable <code>rmail-mail-new-frame</code> to a
non-<code>nil</code> value, then all the Rmail commands to start sending a
message create a new frame to edit it in.  This frame is deleted when
you send the message.

   <p>All the Rmail commands to send a message use the mail-composition
method that you have chosen (see <a href="#Mail-Methods">Mail Methods</a>).

<h3 class="section">33.11 Summaries</h3>

<p><a name="index-summary-_0028Rmail_0029-4028"></a>
  A <dfn>summary</dfn> is a buffer containing one line per message to give
you an overview of the mail in an Rmail file.  Each line shows the
message number and date, the sender, the line count, the labels, and
the subject.  Moving point in the summary buffer selects messages as
you move to their summary lines.  Almost all Rmail commands are valid
in the summary buffer also; when used there, they apply to the message
described by the current line of the summary.

   <p>A summary buffer applies to a single Rmail file only; if you are
editing multiple Rmail files, each one can have its own summary buffer. 
The summary buffer name is made by appending `<samp><span class="samp">-summary</span></samp>' to the
Rmail buffer's name.  Normally only one summary buffer is displayed at a
time.

<h4 class="subsection">33.11.2 Editing in Summaries</h4>

<p>You can use the Rmail summary buffer to do almost anything you can do
in the Rmail buffer itself.  In fact, once you have a summary buffer,
there's no need to switch back to the Rmail buffer.

   <p>You can select and display various messages in the Rmail buffer, from
the summary buffer, just by moving point in the summary buffer to
different lines.  It doesn't matter what Emacs command you use to move
point; whichever line point is on at the end of the command, that
message is selected in the Rmail buffer.

   <p>Almost all Rmail commands work in the summary buffer as well as in
the Rmail buffer.  Thus, <kbd>d</kbd> in the summary buffer deletes the
current message, <kbd>u</kbd> undeletes, and <kbd>x</kbd> expunges.  (However,
in the summary buffer, if there are no more undeleted messages in the
relevant direction, the delete commands go to the first or last
message, rather than staying on the current message.)  <kbd>o</kbd> and
<kbd>C-o</kbd> output the current message to a FILE; <kbd>r</kbd> starts a reply
to it; etc.  You can scroll the current message while remaining in the
summary buffer using &lt;SPC&gt; and &lt;DEL&gt;. 
<!-- rmail-summary-scroll-between-messages not mentioned. -->

   <p><a name="index-rmail_002dsummary_002dundelete_002dmany-4044"></a><kbd>M-u</kbd> (<code>rmail-summary-undelete-many</code>) undeletes all deleted
messages in the summary.  A prefix argument means to undelete that many
of the previous deleted messages.

   <p>The Rmail commands to move between messages also work in the summary
buffer, but with a twist: they move through the set of messages included
in the summary.  They also ensure the Rmail buffer appears on the screen
(unlike cursor motion commands, which update the contents of the Rmail
buffer but don't display it in a window unless it already appears). 
Here is a list of these commands:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>n</kbd><dd>Move to next line, skipping lines saying &ldquo;deleted&rdquo;, and select its
message (<code>rmail-summary-next-msg</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>p</kbd><dd>Move to previous line, skipping lines saying &ldquo;deleted&rdquo;, and select
its message (<code>rmail-summary-previous-msg</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-n</kbd><dd>Move to next line and select its message (<code>rmail-summary-next-all</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-p</kbd><dd>Move to previous line and select its message
(<code>rmail-summary-previous-all</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>&gt;</kbd><dd>Move to the last line, and select its message
(<code>rmail-summary-last-message</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>&lt;</kbd><dd>Move to the first line, and select its message
(<code>rmail-summary-first-message</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>j</kbd><dt><kbd>&lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Select the message on the current line (ensuring that the Rmail buffer
appears on the screen; <code>rmail-summary-goto-msg</code>).  With argument
<var>n</var>, select message number <var>n</var> and move to its line in the
summary buffer; this signals an error if the message is not listed in
the summary buffer. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-s </kbd><var>pattern</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Search through messages for <var>pattern</var> starting with the current
message; select the message found, and move point in the summary buffer
to that message's line (<code>rmail-summary-search</code>).  A prefix argument
acts as a repeat count; a negative argument means search backward
(equivalent to <code>rmail-summary-search-backward</code>.) 
<br><dt><kbd>C-M-n </kbd><var>labels</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Move to the next message with at least one of the specified labels
(<code>rmail-summary-next-labeled-message</code>).  <var>labels</var> is a
comma-separated list of labels.  A prefix argument acts as a repeat
count. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-M-p </kbd><var>labels</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Move to the previous message with at least one of the specified labels
(<code>rmail-summary-previous-labeled-message</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-c C-n &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Move to the next message with the same subject as the current message
(<code>rmail-summary-next-same-subject</code>).  A prefix argument acts as a
repeat count. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-c C-p &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Move to the previous message with the same subject as the current message
(<code>rmail-summary-previous-same-subject</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-rmail_002dredisplay_002dsummary-4045"></a>  Deletion, undeletion, and getting new mail, and even selection of a
different message all update the summary buffer when you do them in the
Rmail buffer.  If the variable <code>rmail-redisplay-summary</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>, these actions also bring the summary buffer back onto
the screen.

   <p><a name="index-Q-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail-summary_0029_007d-4046"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dsummary_002dwipe-4047"></a><a name="index-q-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail-summary_0029_007d-4048"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dsummary_002dquit-4049"></a><a name="index-b-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail-summary_0029_007d-4050"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dsummary_002dbury-4051"></a>  When you are finished using the summary, type <kbd>Q</kbd>
(<code>rmail-summary-wipe</code>) to delete the summary buffer's window.  You
can also exit Rmail while in the summary: <kbd>q</kbd>
(<code>rmail-summary-quit</code>) deletes the summary window, then exits from
Rmail by saving the Rmail file and switching to another buffer. 
Alternatively, <kbd>b</kbd> (<code>rmail-summary-bury</code>) simply buries the
Rmail summary and buffer.

</dl>

   <p>The Rmail sort commands perform a <em>stable sort</em>: if there is no
reason to prefer either one of two messages, their order remains
unchanged.  You can use this to sort by more than one criterion.  For
example, if you use <code>rmail-sort-by-date</code> and then
<code>rmail-sort-by-author</code>, messages from the same author appear in
order by date.

   <p>With a prefix argument, all these commands reverse the order of
comparison.  This means they sort messages from newest to oldest, from
biggest to smallest, or in reverse alphabetical order.

   <p>The same keys in the summary buffer run similar functions; for
example, <kbd>C-c C-s C-l</kbd> runs <code>rmail-summary-sort-by-lines</code>. 
Note that these commands always sort the whole Rmail buffer, even if the
summary is only showing a subset of messages.

   <p>Note that you cannot undo a sort, so you may wish to save the Rmail
buffer before sorting it.

<h3 class="section">33.13 Display of Messages</h3>

<p>This section describes how Rmail displays mail headers,
<acronym>MIME</acronym> sections and attachments, URLs, and encrypted messages.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>t</kbd><dd>Toggle display of complete header (<code>rmail-toggle-header</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-t-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-4061"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dtoggle_002dheader-4062"></a>  Before displaying each message for the first time, Rmail reformats
its header, hiding uninteresting header fields to reduce clutter.  The
<kbd>t</kbd> (<code>rmail-toggle-header</code>) command toggles this, switching
between showing the reformatted header fields and showing the
complete, original header.  With a positive prefix argument, the
command shows the reformatted header; with a zero or negative prefix
argument, it shows the full header.  Selecting the message again also
reformats it if necessary.

   <p><a name="index-rmail_002dignored_002dheaders-4063"></a><a name="index-rmail_002ddisplayed_002dheaders-4064"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dnonignored_002dheaders-4065"></a>  The variable <code>rmail-ignored-headers</code> holds a regular expression
specifying the header fields to hide; any matching header line will be
hidden.  The variable <code>rmail-nonignored-headers</code> overrides this:
any header field matching that regular expression is shown even if it
matches <code>rmail-ignored-headers</code> too.  The variable
<code>rmail-displayed-headers</code> is an alternative to these two
variables; if non-<code>nil</code>, this should be a regular expression
specifying which headers to display (the default is <code>nil</code>).

   <p><a name="index-rmail_002dhighlighted_002dheaders-4066"></a>  Rmail highlights certain header fields that are especially
interesting&mdash;by default, the `<samp><span class="samp">From</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">Subject</span></samp>' fields. 
This highlighting uses the <code>rmail-highlight</code> face.  The variable
<code>rmail-highlighted-headers</code> holds a regular expression specifying
the header fields to highlight; if it matches the beginning of a
header field, that whole field is highlighted.  To disable this
feature, set <code>rmail-highlighted-headers</code> to <code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-MIME-messages-_0028Rmail_0029-4067"></a><a name="index-rmail_002denable_002dmime-4068"></a>  If a message is in <acronym>MIME</acronym> (Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions) format and contains multiple parts (<acronym>MIME</acronym>
entities), Rmail displays each part with a <dfn>tagline</dfn>.  The tagline
summarizes the part's index, size, and content type.  Depending on the
content type, it may also contain one or more buttons; these perform
actions such as saving the part into a file.

     
<a name="index-rmail_002dmime_002dtoggle_002dhidden-4069"></a>

(<code>rmail-mime</code>). 
</dl>

   <p>Each plain-text <acronym>MIME</acronym> part is initially displayed
immediately after its tagline, as part of the Rmail buffer, while
<acronym>MIME</acronym> parts of other types are represented only by their
taglines, with their actual contents hidden.  In either case, you can
toggle a <acronym>MIME</acronym> part between its displayed and hidden
states by typing &lt;RET&gt; anywhere in the part&mdash;or anywhere in its
tagline (except for buttons for other actions, if there are any).  Type
&lt;RET&gt; (or click with the mouse) to activate a tagline button, and
&lt;TAB&gt; to cycle point between tagline buttons.

   <p>The <kbd>v</kbd> (<code>rmail-mime</code>) command toggles between the default
<acronym>MIME</acronym> display described above, and a raw display showing
the undecoded <acronym>MIME</acronym> data.  With a prefix argument, this
command toggles the display of only an entity at point.

   <p><a name="index-rmail_002dmime_002dprefer_002dhtml-4074"></a>  If the message has an <acronym>HTML</acronym> <acronym>MIME</acronym> part, Rmail
displays it in preference to the plain-text part, if Emacs can render
<acronym>HTML</acronym><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-15" name="fnd-15"><sup>15</sup></a>.  To prevent
that, and have the plain-text part displayed instead, customize the
variable <code>rmail-mime-prefer-html</code> to a <code>nil</code> value.

   <p>To prevent Rmail from handling MIME decoded messages, change the
variable <code>rmail-enable-mime</code> to <code>nil</code>.  When this is the
case, the <kbd>v</kbd> (<code>rmail-mime</code>) command instead creates a
temporary buffer to display the current <acronym>MIME</acronym> message.

   <p><a name="index-rmail_002depa_002ddecrypt-4075"></a><a name="index-encrypted-mails-_0028reading-in-Rmail_0029-4076"></a>  If the current message is an encrypted one, use the command <kbd>M-x
rmail-epa-decrypt</kbd> to decrypt it, using the EasyPG library
(see <a href="epa.html#Top">EasyPG</a>).

   <p>You can highlight and activate URLs in the Rmail buffer using Goto
Address mode:

<!-- FIXME goto-addr.el commentary says to use goto-address instead. -->
<pre class="example">     (add-hook 'rmail-show-message-hook 'goto-address-mode)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Then you can browse these URLs by clicking on them with <kbd>mouse-2</kbd>
(or <kbd>mouse-1</kbd> quickly) or by moving to one and typing <kbd>C-c
&lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.  See <a href="#Goto-Address-mode">Activating URLs</a>.

<h3 class="section">33.14 Rmail and Coding Systems</h3>

<p><a name="index-decoding-mail-messages-_0028Rmail_0029-4077"></a>  Rmail automatically decodes messages which contain non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym>
characters, just as Emacs does with files you visit and with subprocess
output.  Rmail uses the standard `<samp><span class="samp">charset=</span><var>charset</var></samp>' header in
the message, if any, to determine how the message was encoded by the
sender.  It maps <var>charset</var> into the corresponding Emacs coding
system (see <a href="#Coding-Systems">Coding Systems</a>), and uses that coding system to decode
message text.  If the message header doesn't have the `<samp><span class="samp">charset</span></samp>'
specification, or if <var>charset</var> is not recognized,
Rmail chooses the coding system with the usual Emacs heuristics and
defaults (see <a href="#Recognize-Coding">Recognize Coding</a>).

   <p><a name="index-fixing-incorrectly-decoded-mail-messages-4078"></a>  Occasionally, a message is decoded incorrectly, either because Emacs
guessed the wrong coding system in the absence of the `<samp><span class="samp">charset</span></samp>'
specification, or because the specification was inaccurate.  For
example, a misconfigured mailer could send a message with a
`<samp><span class="samp">charset=iso-8859-1</span></samp>' header when the message is actually encoded
in <code>koi8-r</code>.  When you see the message text garbled, or some of
its characters displayed as hex codes or empty boxes, this may have
happened.

   <p><a name="index-rmail_002dredecode_002dbody-4079"></a>  You can correct the problem by decoding the message again using the
right coding system, if you can figure out or guess which one is
right.  To do this, invoke the <kbd>M-x rmail-redecode-body</kbd> command. 
It reads the name of a coding system, and then redecodes the message
using the coding system you specified.  If you specified the right
coding system, the result should be readable.

   <p><a name="index-rmail_002dfile_002dcoding_002dsystem-4080"></a>  When you get new mail in Rmail, each message is translated
automatically from the coding system it is written in, as if it were a
separate file.  This uses the priority list of coding systems that you
have specified.  If a MIME message specifies a character set, Rmail
obeys that specification.  For reading and saving Rmail files
themselves, Emacs uses the coding system specified by the variable
<code>rmail-file-coding-system</code>.  The default value is <code>nil</code>,
which means that Rmail files are not translated (they are read and
written in the Emacs internal character code).

<h3 class="section">33.15 Editing Within a Message</h3>

<p>Most of the usual Emacs key bindings are available in Rmail mode,
though a few, such as <kbd>C-M-n</kbd> and <kbd>C-M-h</kbd>, are redefined by
Rmail for other purposes.  However, the Rmail buffer is normally read
only, and most of the letters are redefined as Rmail commands.  If you
want to edit the text of a message, you must use the Rmail command
<kbd>e</kbd>.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>e</kbd><dd>Edit the current message as ordinary text. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-e-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-4081"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dedit_002dcurrent_002dmessage-4082"></a>  The <kbd>e</kbd> command (<code>rmail-edit-current-message</code>) switches from
Rmail mode into Rmail Edit mode, another major mode which is nearly the
same as Text mode.  The mode line indicates this change.

   <p>In Rmail Edit mode, letters insert themselves as usual and the Rmail
commands are not available.  You can edit the message body and header
fields.  When you are finished editing the message, type <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>
to switch back to Rmail mode.  Alternatively, you can return to Rmail
mode but cancel any editing that you have done, by typing <kbd>C-c C-]</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-rmail_002dedit_002dmode_002dhook-4083"></a>  Entering Rmail Edit mode runs the hook <code>text-mode-hook</code>; then
it runs the hook <code>rmail-edit-mode-hook</code> (see <a href="#Hooks">Hooks</a>). 
Returning to ordinary Rmail mode adds the attribute `<samp><span class="samp">edited</span></samp>' to
the message, if you have made any changes in it.

<h3 class="section">33.16 Digest Messages</h3>

<p><a name="index-digest-message-4084"></a><a name="index-undigestify-4085"></a>
  A <dfn>digest message</dfn> is a message which exists to contain and carry
several other messages.  Digests are used on some mailing
lists; all the messages that arrive for the list during a period of time
such as one day are put inside a single digest which is then sent to the
subscribers.  Transmitting the single digest uses less computer
time than transmitting the individual messages even though the total
size is the same, because of the per-message overhead in network mail
transmission.

   <p><a name="index-undigestify_002drmail_002dmessage-4086"></a>  When you receive a digest message, the most convenient way to read it is
to <dfn>undigestify</dfn> it: to turn it back into many individual messages. 
Then you can read and delete the individual messages as it suits you. 
To do this, select the digest message and type the command <kbd>M-x
undigestify-rmail-message</kbd>.  This extracts the submessages as separate
Rmail messages, and inserts them following the digest.  The digest
message itself is flagged as deleted.

<h3 class="section">33.17 Reading Rot13 Messages</h3>

<p><a name="index-rot13-code-4087"></a>
  Mailing list messages that might offend or annoy some readers are sometimes
encoded in a simple code called <dfn>rot13</dfn>&mdash;so named because it
rotates the alphabet by 13 letters.  This code is not for secrecy, as it
provides none; rather, it enables those who wish to to avoid
seeing the real text of the message.  For example, a review of a film
might use rot13 to hide important plot points.

   <p><a name="index-rot13_002dother_002dwindow-4088"></a>  To view a buffer that uses the rot13 code, use the command <kbd>M-x
rot13-other-window</kbd>.  This displays the current buffer in another window
which applies the code when displaying the text.

<h3 class="section">33.18 <code>movemail</code> program</h3>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bmovemail_007d-program-4089"></a>
  Rmail uses the <code>movemail</code> program to move mail from your inbox to
your Rmail file (see <a href="#Rmail-Inbox">Rmail Inbox</a>).  When loaded for the first time,
Rmail attempts to locate the <code>movemail</code> program and determine its
version.  There are two versions of the <code>movemail</code> program: the
native one, shipped with GNU Emacs (the Emacs version) and the one
included in GNU mailutils (the mailutils version,
see <a href="mailutils.html#movemail">movemail</a>).  They support the same
command line syntax and the same basic subset of options.  However, the
Mailutils version offers additional features.

   <p>The Emacs version of <code>movemail</code> is able to retrieve mail from
the usual Unix mailbox formats and from remote mailboxes using the
POP3 protocol.

   <p>The Mailutils version is able to handle a wide set of mailbox
formats, such as plain Unix mailboxes, <code>maildir</code> and <code>MH</code>
mailboxes, etc.  It is able to access remote mailboxes using the POP3
or IMAP4 protocol, and can retrieve mail from them using a TLS
encrypted channel.  It also accepts mailbox arguments in <acronym>URL</acronym>
form.  The detailed description of mailbox <acronym>URL</acronym>s can be found
<!-- Note this node seems to be missing in some versions of mailutils.info? -->
in <a href="mailutils.html#URL">URL</a>.  In short, a
<acronym>URL</acronym> is:

<pre class="smallexample">     <var>proto</var>://[<var>user</var>[:<var>password</var>]@]<var>host-or-file-name</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where square brackets denote optional elements.

     <dl>
<dt><var>proto</var><dd>Specifies the <dfn>mailbox protocol</dfn>, or <dfn>format</dfn> to
use.  The exact semantics of the rest of <acronym>URL</acronym> elements depends
on the actual value of <var>proto</var> (see below).

     <br><dt><var>user</var><dd>User name to access the remote mailbox.

     <br><dt><var>password</var><dd>User password to access the remote mailbox.

     <br><dt><var>host-or-file-name</var><dd>Hostname of the remote server for remote mailboxes or file name of a
local mailbox. 
</dl>

<p class="noindent"><var>Proto</var> can be one of:

     <dl>
<dt><code>mbox</code><dd>Usual Unix mailbox format.  In this case, neither <var>user</var> nor
<var>pass</var> are used, and <var>host-or-file-name</var> denotes the file name
of the mailbox file, e.g., <code>mbox://var/spool/mail/smith</code>.

     <br><dt><code>mh</code><dd>A local mailbox in the <acronym>MH</acronym> format.  <var>User</var> and
<var>pass</var> are not used.  <var>Host-or-file-name</var> denotes the name of
<acronym>MH</acronym> folder, e.g., <code>mh://Mail/inbox</code>.

     <br><dt><code>maildir</code><dd>A local mailbox in the <acronym>maildir</acronym> format.  <var>User</var> and
<var>pass</var> are not used, and <var>host-or-file-name</var> denotes the name of
<code>maildir</code> mailbox, e.g., <code>maildir://mail/inbox</code>.

     <br><dt><code>file</code><dd>Any local mailbox format.  Its actual format is detected automatically
by <code>movemail</code>.

     <br><dt><code>pop</code><dd>A remote mailbox to be accessed via POP3 protocol.  <var>User</var>
specifies the remote user name to use, <var>pass</var> may be used to
specify the user password, <var>host-or-file-name</var> is the name or IP
address of the remote mail server to connect to; e.g.,
<code>pop://smith:guessme@remote.server.net</code>.

     <br><dt><code>imap</code><dd>A remote mailbox to be accessed via IMAP4 protocol.  <var>User</var>
specifies the remote user name to use, <var>pass</var> may be used to
specify the user password, <var>host-or-file-name</var> is the name or IP
address of the remote mail server to connect to;
e.g., <code>imap://smith:guessme@remote.server.net</code>. 
</dl>

   <p>Alternatively, you can specify the file name of the mailbox to use. 
This is equivalent to specifying the `<samp><span class="samp">file</span></samp>' protocol:

<pre class="smallexample">     /var/spool/mail/<var>user</var> == file://var/spool/mail/<var>user</var>
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-rmail_002dmovemail_002dprogram-4090"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dmovemail_002dsearch_002dpath-4091"></a>  The variable <code>rmail-movemail-program</code> controls which version of
<code>movemail</code> to use.  If that is a string, it specifies the
absolute file name of the <code>movemail</code> executable.  If it is
<code>nil</code>, Rmail searches for <code>movemail</code> in the directories
listed in <code>rmail-movemail-search-path</code>, then in <code>exec-path</code>
(see <a href="#Shell">Shell</a>), then in <code>exec-directory</code>.

<h3 class="section">33.19 Retrieving Mail from Remote Mailboxes</h3>

<p><a name="index-movemail-4092"></a>
  Some sites use a method called POP for accessing users' inbox data
instead of storing the data in inbox files.  By default, the <code>Emacs
movemail</code> can work with POP (unless the Emacs <code>configure</code> script
was run with the option `<samp><span class="samp">--without-pop</span></samp>').

   <p>Similarly, the Mailutils <code>movemail</code> by default supports POP, unless
it was configured with the `<samp><span class="samp">--disable-pop</span></samp>' option.

   <p>Both versions of <code>movemail</code> only work with POP3, not with older
versions of POP.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040env_007bMAILHOST_007d-environment-variable-4093"></a><a name="index-POP-mailboxes-4094"></a>  No matter which flavor of <code>movemail</code> you use, you can specify
a POP inbox by using a POP <dfn>URL</dfn> (see <a href="#Movemail">Movemail</a>).  A POP
<acronym>URL</acronym> is of the form
`<samp><span class="samp">pop://</span><var>username</var><span class="samp">@</span><var>hostname</var></samp>', where
<var>hostname</var> is the host name or IP address of the remote mail
server and <var>username</var> is the user name on that server. 
Additionally, you may specify the password in the mailbox <acronym>URL</acronym>:
`<samp><span class="samp">pop://</span><var>username</var><span class="samp">:</span><var>password</var><span class="samp">@</span><var>hostname</var></samp>'.  In this
case, <var>password</var> takes preference over the one set by
<code>rmail-remote-password</code> (see below).  This is especially useful
if you have several remote mailboxes with different passwords.

   <p>For backward compatibility, Rmail also supports an alternative way of
specifying remote POP mailboxes.  Specifying an inbox name in the form
`<samp><span class="samp">po:</span><var>username</var><span class="samp">:</span><var>hostname</var></samp>' is equivalent to
`<samp><span class="samp">pop://</span><var>username</var><span class="samp">@</span><var>hostname</var></samp>'.  If you omit the
<var>:hostname</var> part, the <samp><span class="env">MAILHOST</span></samp> environment variable specifies
the machine on which to look for the POP server.

<!-- FIXME mention -with-hesiod "support Hesiod to get the POP server host"? -->
<p><a name="index-IMAP-mailboxes-4095"></a>  Another method for accessing remote mailboxes is IMAP.  This method is
supported only by the Mailutils <code>movemail</code>.  To specify an IMAP
mailbox in the inbox list, use the following mailbox <acronym>URL</acronym>:
`<samp><span class="samp">imap://</span><var>username</var><span class="samp">[:</span><var>password</var><span class="samp">]@</span><var>hostname</var></samp>'.  The
<var>password</var> part is optional, as described above.

   <p><a name="index-rmail_002dremote_002dpassword-4096"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dremote_002dpassword_002drequired-4097"></a>  Accessing a remote mailbox may require a password.  Rmail uses the
following algorithm to retrieve it:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>If a <var>password</var> is present in the mailbox URL (see above), it is
used. 
<li>If the variable <code>rmail-remote-password-required</code> is <code>nil</code>,
Rmail assumes no password is required. 
<li>If the variable <code>rmail-remote-password</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, its
value is used. 
<li>Otherwise, Rmail will ask you for the password to use.
        </ol>

   <p><a name="index-rmail_002dmovemail_002dflags-4098"></a>  If you need to pass additional command-line flags to <code>movemail</code>,
set the variable <code>rmail-movemail-flags</code> a list of the flags you
wish to use.  Do not use this variable to pass the `<samp><span class="samp">-p</span></samp>' flag to
preserve your inbox contents; use <code>rmail-preserve-inbox</code> instead.

   <p><a name="index-Kerberos-POP-authentication-4099"></a>  The <code>movemail</code> program installed at your site may support
Kerberos authentication (the Emacs <code>movemail</code> does so if Emacs was
configured with the option <code>--with-kerberos</code> or
<code>--with-kerberos5</code>).  If it is supported, it is used by default
whenever you attempt to retrieve POP mail when
<code>rmail-remote-password</code> and <code>rmail-remote-password-required</code>
are unset.

   <p><a name="index-reverse-order-in-POP-inboxes-4100"></a>  Some POP servers store messages in reverse order.  If your server does
this, and you would rather read your mail in the order in which it was
received, you can tell <code>movemail</code> to reverse the order of
downloaded messages by adding the `<samp><span class="samp">-r</span></samp>' flag to
<code>rmail-movemail-flags</code>.

   <p><a name="index-TLS-encryption-_0028Rmail_0029-4101"></a>  Mailutils <code>movemail</code> supports TLS encryption.  If you wish to
use it, add the `<samp><span class="samp">--tls</span></samp>' flag to <code>rmail-movemail-flags</code>.

  Gnus is an Emacs package primarily designed for reading and posting
Usenet news.  It can also be used to read and respond to messages from
a number of other sources&mdash;email, remote directories, digests, and so
on.  Here we introduce Gnus and describe several basic features.

<h3 class="section">34.1 Gnus Buffers</h3>

<p>Gnus uses several buffers to display information and to receive
commands.  The three most commonly-used Gnus buffers are the
<dfn>group buffer</dfn>, the <dfn>summary buffer</dfn> and the <dfn>article
buffer</dfn>.

   <p>The <dfn>group buffer</dfn> contains a list of article sources (e.g.,
newsgroups and email inboxes), which are collectively referred to as
<dfn>groups</dfn>.  This is the first buffer Gnus displays when it starts
up.  It normally displays only the groups to which you subscribe and
that contain unread articles.  From this buffer, you can select a
group to read.

   <p>The <dfn>summary buffer</dfn> lists the articles in a single group,
showing one article per line.  By default, it displays each article's
author, subject, and line
number, but this is customizable; See <a href="gnus.html#Summary-Buffer-Format">Summary Buffer Format</a>. 
The summary buffer is created when you select a group in the group
buffer, and is killed when you exit the group.

   <p>From the summary buffer, you can choose an article to view.  The
article is displayed in the <dfn>article buffer</dfn>.  In normal Gnus
usage, you view this buffer but do not select it&mdash;all useful Gnus
commands can be invoked from the summary buffer.  But you can select
the article buffer, and execute Gnus commands from it, if you wish.

<h3 class="section">34.2 When Gnus Starts Up</h3>

<p><a name="index-gnus-4105"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007b_002enewsrc_007d-file-4106"></a>  If your system has been set up for reading Usenet news, getting
started with Gnus is easy&mdash;just type <kbd>M-x gnus</kbd>.

   <p>On starting up, Gnus reads your <dfn>news initialization file</dfn>: a
file named <samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp> in your home directory which lists your
Usenet newsgroups and subscriptions (this file is not unique to Gnus;
it is used by many other newsreader programs).  It then tries to
contact the system's default news server, which is typically specified
by the <samp><span class="env">NNTPSERVER</span></samp> environment variable.

   <p>If your system does not have a default news server, or if you wish
to use Gnus for reading email, then before invoking <kbd>M-x gnus</kbd> you
need to tell Gnus where to get news and/or mail.  To do this,
customize the variables <code>gnus-select-method</code> and/or
<code>gnus-secondary-select-methods</code>. 
See <a href="gnus.html#Finding-the-News">Finding the News</a>.

   <p>Once Gnus has started up, it displays the group buffer.  By default,
the group buffer shows only a small number of <dfn>subscribed groups</dfn>. 
Groups with other statuses&mdash;<dfn>unsubscribed</dfn>, <dfn>killed</dfn>, or
<dfn>zombie</dfn>&mdash;are hidden.  The first time you start Gnus, any group
to which you are not subscribed is made into a killed group; any group
that subsequently appears on the news server becomes a zombie group.

   <p>To proceed, you must select a group in the group buffer to open the
summary buffer for that group; then, select an article in the summary
buffer to view its article buffer in a separate window.  The following
sections explain how to use the group and summary buffers to do this.

   <p>To quit Gnus, type <kbd>q</kbd> in the group buffer.  This automatically
records your group statuses in the files <samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">.newsrc.eld</span></samp>, so that they take effect in subsequent Gnus
sessions.

<h2 class="chapter">35 Host Security</h2>

<p><a name="index-security-4149"></a>
Emacs runs inside an operating system such as GNU/Linux, and relies on
the operating system to check security constraints such as accesses to
files.  The default settings for Emacs are designed for typical use;
they may require some tailoring in environments where security is more
of a concern, or less of a concern, than usual.  For example,
file-local variables can be risky, and you can set the variable
<code>enable-local-variables</code> to <code>:safe</code> or (even more
conservatively) to <code>nil</code>; conversely, if your files can all be
trusted and the default checking for these variables is irritating,
you can set <code>enable-local-variables</code> to <code>:all</code>.  See <a href="#Safe-File-Variables">Safe File Variables</a>.

   <p>See <a href="elisp.html#Security-Considerations">Security Considerations</a>, for more information about security considerations when using
Emacs as part of a larger application.

<p><a name="index-network-security-manager-4150"></a><a name="index-NSM-4151"></a><a name="index-encryption-4152"></a><a name="index-SSL-4153"></a><a name="index-TLS-4154"></a><a name="index-STARTTLS-4155"></a>
Whenever Emacs establishes any network connection, it passes the
established connection to the <dfn>Network Security Manager</dfn>
(<acronym>NSM</acronym>).  <acronym>NSM</acronym> is responsible for enforcing the
network security under your control.

   <p><a name="index-network_002dsecurity_002dlevel-4156"></a>The <code>network-security-level</code> variable determines the security
level that <acronym>NSM</acronym> enforces.  If its value is <code>low</code>, no
security checks are performed.

   <p>If this variable is <code>medium</code> (which is the default), a number of
checks will be performed.  If as result <acronym>NSM</acronym> determines that
the network connection might not be trustworthy, it will make you
aware of that, and will ask you what to do about the network
connection.

   <p>You can decide to register a permanent security exception for an
unverified connection, a temporary exception, or refuse the connection
entirely.

   <p>Below is a list of the checks done on the <code>medium</code> level.

     <dl>
<dt>unable to verify a <acronym>TLS</acronym> certificate<dd>If the connection is a <acronym>TLS</acronym>, <acronym>SSL</acronym> or
<acronym>STARTTLS</acronym> connection, <acronym>NSM</acronym> will check whether
the certificate used to establish the identity of the server we're
connecting to can be verified.

     <p>While an invalid certificate is often the cause for concern (there
could be a Man-in-the-Middle hijacking your network connection and
stealing your password), there may be valid reasons for going ahead
with the connection anyway.  For instance, the server may be using a
self-signed certificate, or the certificate may have expired.  It's up
to you to determine whether it's acceptable to continue with the
connection.

     <br><dt>a self-signed certificate has changed<dd>If you've previously accepted a self-signed certificate, but it has
now changed, that could mean that the server has just changed the
certificate, but it might also mean that the network connection has
been hijacked.

     <br><dt>previously encrypted connection now unencrypted<dd>If the connection is unencrypted, but it was encrypted in previous
sessions, this might mean that there is a proxy between you and the
server that strips away <acronym>STARTTLS</acronym> announcements, leaving the
connection unencrypted.  This is usually very suspicious.

     <br><dt>talking to an unencrypted service when sending a password<dd>When connecting to an <acronym>IMAP</acronym> or <acronym>POP3</acronym> server, these
should usually be encrypted, because it's common to send passwords
over these connections.  Similarly, if you're sending email via
<acronym>SMTP</acronym> that requires a password, you usually want that
connection to be encrypted.  If the connection isn't encrypted,
<acronym>NSM</acronym> will warn you.

   </dl>

   <p>If <code>network-security-level</code> is <code>high</code>, the following checks
will be made, in addition to the above:

     <dl>
<dt>a validated certificate changes the public key<dd>Servers change their keys occasionally, and that is normally nothing
to be concerned about.  However, if you are worried that your network
connections are being hijacked by agencies who have access to pliable
Certificate Authorities which issue new certificates for third-party
services, you may want to keep track of these changes.

     <br><dt>Diffie-Hellman low prime bits<dd>When doing the public key exchange, the number of prime bits
should be high to ensure that the channel can't be eavesdropped on by
third parties.  If this number is too low, you will be warned.

     <br><dt><acronym>RC4</acronym> stream cipher<dd>The <acronym>RC4</acronym> stream cipher is believed to be of low quality and
may allow eavesdropping by third parties.

     <br><dt><acronym>SSL1</acronym>, <acronym>SSL2</acronym> and <acronym>SSL3</acronym><dd>The protocols older than <acronym>TLS1.0</acronym> are believed to be
vulnerable to a variety of attacks, and you may want to avoid using
these if what you're doing requires higher security. 
</dl>

   <p>Finally, if <code>network-security-level</code> is <code>paranoid</code>, you will
also be notified the first time <acronym>NSM</acronym> sees any new
certificate.  This will allow you to inspect all the certificates from
all the connections that Emacs makes.

   <p>The following additional variables can be used to control details of
<acronym>NSM</acronym> operation:

     <dl>
<dt><code>nsm-settings-file</code><dd><a name="index-nsm_002dsettings_002dfile-4157"></a>This is the file where <acronym>NSM</acronym> stores details about connections. 
It defaults to <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs.d/network-security.data</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>nsm-save-host-names</code><dd><a name="index-nsm_002dsave_002dhost_002dnames-4158"></a>By default, host names will not be saved for non-<code>STARTTLS</code>
connections.  Instead a host/port hash is used to identify connections. 
This means that one can't casually read the settings file to see what
servers the user has connected to.  If this variable is <code>t</code>,
<acronym>NSM</acronym> will also save host names in the nsm-settings-file.

mode, Emacs automatically uses DocView mode <a rel="footnote" href="#fn-17" name="fnd-17"><sup>17</sup></a>.  As an exception, when you visit a PostScript file, Emacs
switches to PS mode, a major mode for editing PostScript files as
text; however, it also enables DocView minor mode, so you can type
<kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> to view the document with DocView.  In either DocView
mode or DocView minor mode, repeating <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>
(<code>doc-view-toggle-display</code>) toggles between DocView and the
underlying file contents.

   <p><a name="index-doc_002dview_002dopen_002dtext-4172"></a>  When you visit a file which would normally be handled by DocView
mode but some requirement is not met (e.g., you operate in a terminal
frame or emacs has no PNG support), you are queried if you want to
view the document's contents as plain text.  If you confirm, the
buffer is put in text mode and DocView minor mode is activated.  Thus,
by typing <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> you switch to the fallback mode.  With another
<kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> you return to DocView mode.  The plain text contents can
also be displayed from within DocView mode by typing <kbd>C-c C-t</kbd>
(<code>doc-view-open-text</code>).

   <p>You can explicitly enable DocView mode with the command <code>M-x
doc-view-mode</code>.  You can toggle DocView minor mode with <code>M-x
doc-view-minor-mode</code>.

   <p>When DocView mode starts, it displays a welcome screen and begins
formatting the file, page by page.  It displays the first page once
that has been formatted.

   <p>To kill the DocView buffer, type <kbd>k</kbd>
(<code>doc-view-kill-proc-and-buffer</code>).  To bury it, type <kbd>q</kbd>
(<code>quit-window</code>).

<h3 class="section">37.2 DocView Searching</h3>

<p>In DocView mode, you can search the file's text for a regular
expression (see <a href="#Regexps">Regexps</a>).  The interface for searching is inspired
by <code>isearch</code> (see <a href="#Incremental-Search">Incremental Search</a>).

   <p><a name="index-doc_002dview_002dsearch-4194"></a><a name="index-doc_002dview_002dsearch_002dbackward-4195"></a><a name="index-doc_002dview_002dshow_002dtooltip-4196"></a>  To begin a search, type <kbd>C-s</kbd> (<code>doc-view-search</code>) or
<kbd>C-r</kbd> (<code>doc-view-search-backward</code>).  This reads a regular
expression using a minibuffer, then echoes the number of matches found
within the document.  You can move forward and back among the matches
by typing <kbd>C-s</kbd> and <kbd>C-r</kbd>.  DocView mode has no way to show
the match inside the page image; instead, it displays a tooltip (at
the mouse position) listing all matching lines in the current page. 
To force display of this tooltip, type <kbd>C-t</kbd>
(<code>doc-view-show-tooltip</code>).

   <p>To start a new search, use the search command with a prefix
argument; i.e., <kbd>C-u C-s</kbd> for a forward search or <kbd>C-u C-r</kbd>
for a backward search.

<h3 class="section">37.3 DocView Slicing</h3>

<p>Documents often have wide margins for printing.  They are annoying
when reading the document on the screen, because they use up screen
space and can cause inconvenient scrolling.

   <p><a name="index-doc_002dview_002dset_002dslice-4197"></a><a name="index-doc_002dview_002dset_002dslice_002dusing_002dmouse-4198"></a>  With DocView you can hide these margins by selecting a <dfn>slice</dfn>
of pages to display.  A slice is a rectangle within the page area;
once you specify a slice in DocView, it applies to whichever page you
look at.

   <p>To specify the slice numerically, type <kbd>s s</kbd>
(<code>doc-view-set-slice</code>); then enter the top left pixel position
and the slice's width and height. 
<!-- ??? how does this work? -->

   <p>A more convenient graphical way to specify the slice is with <kbd>s
m</kbd> (<code>doc-view-set-slice-using-mouse</code>), where you use the mouse to
select the slice.  Simply press and hold the left mouse button at the
upper-left corner of the region you want to have in the slice, then
move the mouse pointer to the lower-right corner and release the
button.

   <p>The most convenient way is to set the optimal slice by using
BoundingBox information automatically determined from the document by
typing <kbd>s b</kbd> (<code>doc-view-set-slice-from-bounding-box</code>).

   <p><a name="index-doc_002dview_002dreset_002dslice-4199"></a>  To cancel the selected slice, type <kbd>s r</kbd>
(<code>doc-view-reset-slice</code>).  Then DocView shows the entire page
including its entire margins.

if there is an active region (see <a href="#Mark">Mark</a>), the default URL comes
from the region instead, after removing any whitespace from it.  The
command then creates a new buffer with the embedded browser showing
the specified URL.  The buffer is put in the Xwidget-WebKit mode
(similar to Image mode, see <a href="#File-Conveniences">File Conveniences</a>), which provides
one-key commands for scrolling the widget, changing its size, and

(either in the <var>cmd</var> argument to one of the above commands, or in
other contexts), Emacs searches for the program in the directories
specified by the variable <code>exec-path</code>.  The value of this

<h3 class="section">40.1 Single Shell Commands</h3>

<p><a name="index-M_002d_0021-4215"></a><a name="index-shell_002dcommand-4216"></a>  <kbd>M-!</kbd> (<code>shell-command</code>) reads a line of text using the
minibuffer and executes it as a shell command, in a subshell made just
for that command.  Standard input for the command comes from the null
device.  If the shell command produces any output, the output appears
either in the echo area (if it is short), or in an Emacs buffer named
<samp><span class="file">*Shell Command Output*</span></samp>, displayed in another window (if the
output is long).

   <p>For instance, one way to decompress a file named <samp><span class="file">foo.gz</span></samp> is to
type <kbd>M-! gunzip foo.gz &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.  That shell command normally
creates the file <samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp> and produces no terminal output.

   <p>A numeric argument to <code>shell-command</code>, e.g., <kbd>M-1 M-!</kbd>,
causes it to insert terminal output into the current buffer instead of
a separate buffer.  It puts point before the output, and sets the mark
after the output.  For instance, <kbd>M-1 M-! gunzip &lt; foo.gz
&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> would insert the uncompressed form of the file
<samp><span class="file">foo.gz</span></samp> into the current buffer.

   <p>Provided the specified shell command does not end with `<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>', it
runs <dfn>synchronously</dfn>, and you must wait for it to exit before
continuing to use Emacs.  To stop waiting, type <kbd>C-g</kbd> to quit;
this sends a <code>SIGINT</code> signal to terminate the shell command (this
is the same signal that <kbd>C-c</kbd> normally generates in the shell). 
Emacs then waits until the command actually terminates.  If the shell
command doesn't stop (because it ignores the <code>SIGINT</code> signal),
type <kbd>C-g</kbd> again; this sends the command a <code>SIGKILL</code> signal,
which is impossible to ignore.

   <p><a name="index-M_002d_0026-4217"></a><a name="index-async_002dshell_002dcommand-4218"></a>  A shell command that ends in `<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>' is executed
<dfn>asynchronously</dfn>, and you can continue to use Emacs as it runs. 
You can also type <kbd>M-&amp;</kbd> (<code>async-shell-command</code>) to execute a
shell command asynchronously; this is exactly like calling <kbd>M-!</kbd>
with a trailing `<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>', except that you do not need the `<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>'. 
The default output buffer for asynchronous shell commands is named
`<samp><span class="samp">*Async Shell Command*</span></samp>'.  Emacs inserts the output into this
buffer as it comes in, whether or not the buffer is visible in a
window.

   <p><a name="index-async_002dshell_002dcommand_002dbuffer-4219"></a>  If you want to run more than one asynchronous shell command at the
same time, they could end up competing for the output buffer.  The
option <code>async-shell-command-buffer</code> specifies what to do about
this; e.g., whether to rename the pre-existing output buffer, or to
use a different buffer for the new command.  Consult the variable's
documentation for more possibilities.

   <p><a name="index-M_002d_007c-4220"></a><a name="index-shell_002dcommand_002don_002dregion-4221"></a>  <kbd>M-|</kbd> (<code>shell-command-on-region</code>) is like <kbd>M-!</kbd>, but
passes the contents of the region as the standard input to the shell
command, instead of no input.  With a numeric argument, it deletes the
old region and replaces it with the output from the shell command.

   <p>For example, you can use <kbd>M-|</kbd> with the <samp><span class="command">gpg</span></samp> program to
see what keys are in the buffer.  If the buffer contains a GnuPG key,
type <kbd>C-x h M-| gpg &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> to feed the entire buffer contents
to <samp><span class="command">gpg</span></samp>.  This will output the list of keys to the
<samp><span class="file">*Shell Command Output*</span></samp> buffer.

   <p><a name="index-shell_002dfile_002dname-4222"></a>  The above commands use the shell specified by the variable
<code>shell-file-name</code>.  Its default value is determined by the
<samp><span class="env">SHELL</span></samp> environment variable when Emacs is started.  If the file
name is relative, Emacs searches the directories listed in
<code>exec-path</code> (see <a href="#Shell">Shell</a>).

   <p>To specify a coding system for <kbd>M-!</kbd> or <kbd>M-|</kbd>, use the command
<kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt; c</kbd> immediately beforehand.  See <a href="#Communication-Coding">Communication Coding</a>.

   <p><a name="index-shell_002dcommand_002ddefault_002derror_002dbuffer-4223"></a>  By default, error output is intermixed with the regular output in
the output buffer.  But if you change the value of the variable
<code>shell-command-default-error-buffer</code> to a string, error output is
inserted into a buffer of that name.

<h3 class="section">40.2 Interactive Subshell</h3>

<p><a name="index-shell-4224"></a>  To run a subshell interactively, type <kbd>M-x shell</kbd>.  This creates
(or reuses) a buffer named <samp><span class="file">*shell*</span></samp>, and runs a shell subprocess
with input coming from and output going to that buffer.  That is to
say, any terminal output from the subshell goes into the buffer,
advancing point, and any terminal input for the subshell comes from
text in the buffer.  To give input to the subshell, go to the end of
the buffer and type the input, terminated by &lt;RET&gt;.

   <p>By default, when the subshell is invoked interactively, the
<samp><span class="file">*shell*</span></samp> buffer is displayed in a new window.  This behavior can
be customized via <code>display-buffer-alist</code> (see <a href="#Window-Choice">Window Choice</a>).

   <p>While the subshell is waiting or running a command, you can switch
windows or buffers and perform other editing in Emacs.  Emacs inserts
the output from the subshell into the Shell buffer whenever it has
time to process it (e.g., while waiting for keyboard input).

<code>comint-highlight-prompt</code>, and submitted input lines are
displayed with the face <code>comint-highlight-input</code>.  This makes it
easier to distinguish input lines from the shell output. 
See <a href="#Faces">Faces</a>.

   <p>To make multiple subshells, invoke <kbd>M-x shell</kbd> with a prefix
argument (e.g., <kbd>C-u M-x shell</kbd>).  Then the command will read a
buffer name, and create (or reuse) a subshell in that buffer.  You can
also rename the <samp><span class="file">*shell*</span></samp> buffer using <kbd>M-x rename-uniquely</kbd>,
then create a new <samp><span class="file">*shell*</span></samp> buffer using plain <kbd>M-x shell</kbd>. 
Subshells in different buffers run independently and in parallel.

the variable <code>explicit-shell-file-name</code>.  If this is <code>nil</code>
(the default), Emacs uses the environment variable <samp><span class="env">ESHELL</span></samp> if it
exists.  Otherwise, it usually uses the variable
<code>shell-file-name</code> (see <a href="#Single-Shell">Single Shell</a>); but if the default
directory is remote (see <a href="#Remote-Files">Remote Files</a>), it prompts you for the
shell file name.

   <p>Emacs sends the new shell the contents of the file
<samp><span class="file">~/.emacs_</span><var>shellname</var></samp> as input, if it exists, where
<var>shellname</var> is the name of the file that the shell was loaded
from.  For example, if you use bash, the file sent to it is
<samp><span class="file">~/.emacs_bash</span></samp>.  If this file is not found, Emacs tries with
<samp><span class="file">~/.emacs.d/init_</span><var>shellname</var><span class="file">.sh</span></samp>.

   <p>To specify a coding system for the shell, you can use the command
<kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt; c</kbd> immediately before <kbd>M-x shell</kbd>.  You can
also change the coding system for a running subshell by typing
<kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt; p</kbd> in the shell buffer.  See <a href="#Communication-Coding">Communication Coding</a>.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040env_007bINSIDE_005fEMACS_007d-environment-variable-4231"></a>  Emacs sets the environment variable <samp><span class="env">INSIDE_EMACS</span></samp> in the
subshell to `<samp><var>version</var><span class="samp">,comint</span></samp>', where <var>version</var> is the
Emacs version (e.g., `<samp><span class="samp">24.1</span></samp>').  Programs can check this variable
to determine whether they are running inside an Emacs subshell.

<h3 class="section">40.3 Shell Mode</h3>

<p><a name="index-Shell-mode-4232"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Shell-4233"></a>
  The major mode for Shell buffers is Shell mode.  Many of its special
commands are bound to the <kbd>C-c</kbd> prefix, and resemble the usual
editing and job control characters present in ordinary shells, except
that you must type <kbd>C-c</kbd> first.  Here is a list of Shell mode
commands:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>&lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-RET-_0040r_007b_0028Shell-mode_0029_007d-4234"></a><a name="index-comint_002dsend_002dinput-4235"></a>Send the current line as input to the subshell
(<code>comint-send-input</code>).  Any shell prompt at the beginning of the
line is omitted (see <a href="#Shell-Prompts">Shell Prompts</a>).  If point is at the end of
buffer, this is like submitting the command line in an ordinary
interactive shell.  However, you can also invoke &lt;RET&gt; elsewhere
in the shell buffer to submit the current line as input.

     <br><dt><kbd>&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-TAB-_0040r_007b_0028Shell-mode_0029_007d-4236"></a><a name="index-completion_002dat_002dpoint-4237"></a><a name="index-shell-completion-4238"></a>Complete the command name or file name before point in the shell
buffer (<code>completion-at-point</code>).  This uses the usual Emacs
completion rules (see <a href="#Completion">Completion</a>), with the completion
alternatives being file names, environment variable names, the shell
command history, and history references (see <a href="#History-References">History References</a>). 
For options controlling the completion, see <a href="#Shell-Options">Shell Options</a>.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-?</kbd><dd><a name="index-M_002d_003f-_0040r_007b_0028Shell-mode_0029_007d-4239"></a><a name="index-comint_002ddynamic_002dlist_002dfilename_0040dots_007b_007d-4240"></a>Display temporarily a list of the possible completions of the file
name before point (<code>comint-dynamic-list-filename-completions</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-d</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dd-_0040r_007b_0028Shell-mode_0029_007d-4241"></a><a name="index-comint_002ddelchar_002dor_002dmaybe_002deof-4242"></a>Either delete a character or send <acronym>EOF</acronym>
(<code>comint-delchar-or-maybe-eof</code>).  Typed at the end of the shell
buffer, this sends <acronym>EOF</acronym> to the subshell.  Typed at any other
position in the buffer, this deletes a character as usual.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-a</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002da-_0040r_007b_0028Shell-mode_0029_007d-4243"></a><a name="index-comint_002dbol_002dor_002dprocess_002dmark-4244"></a>Move to the beginning of the line, but after the prompt if any
(<code>comint-bol-or-process-mark</code>).  If you repeat this command twice
in a row, the second time it moves back to the process mark, which is
the beginning of the input that you have not yet sent to the subshell. 
(Normally that is the same place&mdash;the end of the prompt on this
line&mdash;but after <kbd>C-c &lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> the process mark may be in a
previous line.)

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c &lt;SPC&gt;</kbd><dd>Accumulate multiple lines of input, then send them together.  This
command inserts a newline before point, but does not send the preceding
text as input to the subshell&mdash;at least, not yet.  Both lines, the one
before this newline and the one after, will be sent together (along with
the newline that separates them), when you type &lt;RET&gt;.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-u</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002du-_0040r_007b_0028Shell-mode_0029_007d-4245"></a><a name="index-comint_002dkill_002dinput-4246"></a>Kill all text pending at end of buffer to be sent as input
(<code>comint-kill-input</code>).  If point is not at end of buffer,
this only kills the part of this text that precedes point.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-w</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dw-_0040r_007b_0028Shell-mode_0029_007d-4247"></a>Kill a word before point (<code>backward-kill-word</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-c</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dc-_0040r_007b_0028Shell-mode_0029_007d-4248"></a><a name="index-comint_002dinterrupt_002dsubjob-4249"></a>Interrupt the shell or its current subjob if any
(<code>comint-interrupt-subjob</code>).  This command also kills
any shell input pending in the shell buffer and not yet sent.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-z</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dz-_0040r_007b_0028Shell-mode_0029_007d-4250"></a><a name="index-comint_002dstop_002dsubjob-4251"></a>Stop the shell or its current subjob if any (<code>comint-stop-subjob</code>). 
This command also kills any shell input pending in the shell buffer and
not yet sent.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-\</kbd><dd><a name="index-comint_002dquit_002dsubjob-4252"></a><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002d_005c-_0040r_007b_0028Shell-mode_0029_007d-4253"></a>Send quit signal to the shell or its current subjob if any
(<code>comint-quit-subjob</code>).  This command also kills any shell input
pending in the shell buffer and not yet sent.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-o</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002do-_0040r_007b_0028Shell-mode_0029_007d-4254"></a><a name="index-comint_002ddelete_002doutput-4255"></a>Delete the last batch of output from a shell command
(<code>comint-delete-output</code>).  This is useful if a shell command spews
out lots of output that just gets in the way.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-s</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002ds-_0040r_007b_0028Shell-mode_0029_007d-4256"></a><a name="index-comint_002dwrite_002doutput-4257"></a>Write the last batch of output from a shell command to a file
(<code>comint-write-output</code>).  With a prefix argument, the file is
appended to instead.  Any prompt at the end of the output is not
written.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-r</kbd><dt><kbd>C-M-l</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dr-_0040r_007b_0028Shell-mode_0029_007d-4258"></a><a name="index-C_002dM_002dl-_0040r_007b_0028Shell-mode_0029_007d-4259"></a><a name="index-comint_002dshow_002doutput-4260"></a>Scroll to display the beginning of the last batch of output at the top

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-e</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002de-_0040r_007b_0028Shell-mode_0029_007d-4261"></a><a name="index-comint_002dshow_002dmaximum_002doutput-4262"></a>Scroll to put the end of the buffer at the bottom of the window
(<code>comint-show-maximum-output</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-f</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002df-_0040r_007b_0028Shell-mode_0029_007d-4263"></a><a name="index-shell_002dforward_002dcommand-4264"></a><a name="index-shell_002dcommand_002dregexp-4265"></a>Move forward across one shell command, but not beyond the current line
(<code>shell-forward-command</code>).  The variable <code>shell-command-regexp</code>
specifies how to recognize the end of a command.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-b</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002db-_0040r_007b_0028Shell-mode_0029_007d-4266"></a><a name="index-shell_002dbackward_002dcommand-4267"></a>Move backward across one shell command, but not beyond the current line
(<code>shell-backward-command</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x dirs</kbd><dd>Ask the shell for its working directory, and update the Shell buffer's
default directory.  See <a href="#Directory-Tracking">Directory Tracking</a>.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x send-invisible &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>text</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-send_002dinvisible-4268"></a>Send <var>text</var> as input to the shell, after reading it without
echoing.  This is useful when a shell command runs a program that asks
for a password.

     <p>Please note that Emacs will not echo passwords by default.  If you
really want them to be echoed, evaluate (see <a href="#Lisp-Eval">Lisp Eval</a>) the
following Lisp expression:

     <pre class="example">          (remove-hook 'comint-output-filter-functions
                       'comint-watch-for-password-prompt)
     </pre>
     <br><dt><kbd>M-x comint-continue-subjob</kbd><dd><a name="index-comint_002dcontinue_002dsubjob-4269"></a>Continue the shell process.  This is useful if you accidentally suspend
the shell process.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-18" name="fnd-18"><sup>18</sup></a>

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x comint-strip-ctrl-m</kbd><dd><a name="index-comint_002dstrip_002dctrl_002dm-4270"></a>Discard all control-M characters from the current group of shell output. 
The most convenient way to use this command is to make it run
automatically when you get output from the subshell.  To do that,
evaluate this Lisp expression:

     <pre class="example">          (add-hook 'comint-output-filter-functions
                    'comint-strip-ctrl-m)
     </pre>
     <br><dt><kbd>M-x comint-truncate-buffer</kbd><dd><a name="index-comint_002dtruncate_002dbuffer-4271"></a>This command truncates the shell buffer to a certain maximum number of
lines, specified by the variable <code>comint-buffer-maximum-size</code>. 
Here's how to do this automatically each time you get output from the
subshell:

     <pre class="example">          (add-hook 'comint-output-filter-functions
                    'comint-truncate-buffer)
     </pre>
     </dl>

   <p><a name="index-Comint-mode-4272"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Comint-4273"></a>  Shell mode is a derivative of Comint mode, a general-purpose mode for
communicating with interactive subprocesses.  Most of the features of
Shell mode actually come from Comint mode, as you can see from the
command names listed above.  The special features of Shell mode include
the directory tracking feature, and a few user commands.

   <p>Other Emacs features that use variants of Comint mode include GUD
(see <a href="#Debuggers">Debuggers</a>) and <kbd>M-x run-lisp</kbd> (see <a href="#External-Lisp">External Lisp</a>).

   <p><a name="index-comint_002drun-4274"></a>  You can use <kbd>M-x comint-run</kbd> to execute any program of your choice
in a subprocess using unmodified Comint mode&mdash;without the
specializations of Shell mode.

<h3 class="section">40.4 Shell Prompts</h3>

<p><a name="index-prompt_002c-shell-4275"></a>  A prompt is text output by a program to show that it is ready to
accept new user input.  Normally, Comint mode (and thus Shell mode)
automatically figures out part of the buffer is a prompt, based on the
output of the subprocess.  (Specifically, it assumes that any received
output line which doesn't end with a newline is a prompt.)

   <p>Comint mode divides the buffer into two types of <dfn>fields</dfn>: input
fields (where user input is typed) and output fields (everywhere
else).  Prompts are part of the output fields.  Most Emacs motion
commands do not cross field boundaries, unless they move over multiple
lines.  For instance, when point is in the input field on a shell
command line, <kbd>C-a</kbd> puts point at the beginning of the input
field, after the prompt.  Internally, the fields are implemented using
the <code>field</code> text property (see <a href="elisp.html#Text-Properties">Text Properties</a>).

   <p><a name="index-comint_002duse_002dprompt_002dregexp-4276"></a><a name="index-shell_002dprompt_002dpattern-4277"></a>  If you change the variable <code>comint-use-prompt-regexp</code> to a
non-<code>nil</code> value, then Comint mode recognize prompts using a
regular expression (see <a href="#Regexps">Regexps</a>).  In Shell mode, the regular
expression is specified by the variable <code>shell-prompt-pattern</code>. 
The default value of <code>comint-use-prompt-regexp</code> is <code>nil</code>,
because this method for recognizing prompts is unreliable, but you may
want to set it to a non-<code>nil</code> value in unusual circumstances.  In
that case, Emacs does not divide the Comint buffer into fields, so the
general motion commands behave as they normally do in buffers without
special text properties.  However, you can use the paragraph motion
commands to conveniently navigate the buffer (see <a href="#Paragraphs">Paragraphs</a>); in
Shell mode, Emacs uses <code>shell-prompt-pattern</code> as paragraph
boundaries.

<h3 class="section">40.5 Shell Command History</h3>

<p>Shell buffers support three ways of repeating earlier commands.  You
can use keys like those used for the minibuffer history; these work
much as they do in the minibuffer, inserting text from prior commands
while point remains always at the end of the buffer.  You can move
through the buffer to previous inputs in their original place, then
resubmit them or copy them to the end.  Or you can use a
`<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>'-style history reference.

(<code>comint-dynamic-list-input-ring</code>). 
</dl>

   <p>Shell buffers provide a history of previously entered shell
commands.  To reuse shell commands from the history, use the editing
commands <kbd>M-p</kbd>, <kbd>M-n</kbd>, <kbd>M-r</kbd> and <kbd>M-s</kbd>.  These work
just like the minibuffer history commands (see <a href="#Minibuffer-History">Minibuffer History</a>), except that they operate within the Shell buffer rather
than the minibuffer.

   <p><kbd>M-p</kbd> fetches an earlier shell command to the end of the shell
buffer.  Successive use of <kbd>M-p</kbd> fetches successively earlier
shell commands, each replacing any text that was already present as
potential shell input.  <kbd>M-n</kbd> does likewise except that it finds
successively more recent shell commands from the buffer. 
<kbd>C-&lt;UP&gt;</kbd> works like <kbd>M-p</kbd>, and <kbd>C-&lt;DOWN&gt;</kbd> like
<kbd>M-n</kbd>.

   <p>The history search command <kbd>M-r</kbd> begins an incremental regular
expression search of previous shell commands.  After typing <kbd>M-r</kbd>,
start typing the desired string or regular expression; the last
matching shell command will be displayed in the current line. 
Incremental search commands have their usual effects&mdash;for instance,
<kbd>C-s</kbd> and <kbd>C-r</kbd> search forward and backward for the next match
(see <a href="#Incremental-Search">Incremental Search</a>).  When you find the desired input, type
&lt;RET&gt; to terminate the search.  This puts the input in the command
line.  Any partial input you were composing before navigating the
history list is restored when you go to the beginning or end of the
history ring.

   <p>Often it is useful to reexecute several successive shell commands that
were previously executed in sequence.  To do this, first find and
reexecute the first command of the sequence.  Then type <kbd>C-c C-x</kbd>;
that will fetch the following command&mdash;the one that follows the command
you just repeated.  Then type &lt;RET&gt; to reexecute this command.  You
can reexecute several successive commands by typing <kbd>C-c C-x
&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> over and over.

   <p>The command <kbd>C-c .</kbd> (<code>comint-input-previous-argument</code>)
copies an individual argument from a previous command, like
<kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; .</kbd> in Bash.  The simplest use copies the last argument from the
previous shell command.  With a prefix argument <var>n</var>, it copies the
<var>n</var>th argument instead.  Repeating <kbd>C-c .</kbd> copies from an
earlier shell command instead, always using the same value of <var>n</var>
(don't give a prefix argument when you repeat the <kbd>C-c .</kbd>
command).

   <p>These commands get the text of previous shell commands from a special
history list, not from the shell buffer itself.  Thus, editing the shell
buffer, or even killing large parts of it, does not affect the history
that these commands access.

   <p><a name="index-shell_002dinput_002dring_002dfile_002dname-4290"></a>  Some shells store their command histories in files so that you can
refer to commands from previous shell sessions.  Emacs reads
the command history file for your chosen shell, to initialize its own
command history.  The file name is <samp><span class="file">~/.bash_history</span></samp> for bash,
<samp><span class="file">~/.sh_history</span></samp> for ksh, and <samp><span class="file">~/.history</span></samp> for other shells.

<h4 class="subsection">40.5.3 Shell History References</h4>

<p><a name="index-history-reference-4297"></a>
  Various shells including csh and bash support <dfn>history
references</dfn> that begin with `<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>'.  Shell mode
recognizes these constructs, and can perform the history substitution
for you.

   <p>If you insert a history reference and type &lt;TAB&gt;, this searches
the input history for a matching command, performs substitution if
necessary, and places the result in the buffer in place of the history
reference.  For example, you can fetch the most recent command
beginning with `<samp><span class="samp">mv</span></samp>' with <kbd>! m v &lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>.  You can edit the
command if you wish, and then resubmit the command to the shell by
typing &lt;RET&gt;.

   <p><a name="index-comint_002dinput_002dautoexpand-4298"></a><a name="index-comint_002dmagic_002dspace-4299"></a>  Shell mode can optionally expand history references in the buffer
when you send them to the shell.  To request this, set the variable
<code>comint-input-autoexpand</code> to <code>input</code>.  You can make
&lt;SPC&gt; perform history expansion by binding &lt;SPC&gt; to the
command <code>comint-magic-space</code>.

   <p>Shell mode recognizes history references when they follow a prompt. 
See <a href="#Shell-Prompts">Shell Prompts</a>, for how Shell mode recognizes prompts.

commands given to the subshell, in order to keep the Shell buffer's
default directory (see <a href="#File-Names">File Names</a>) the same as the shell's working
directory.  It recognizes these commands by examining lines of input
that you send.

   <p>If you use aliases for these commands, you can tell Emacs to
recognize them also, by setting the variables
<code>shell-pushd-regexp</code>, <code>shell-popd-regexp</code>, and
<code>shell-cd-regexp</code> to the appropriate regular expressions
(see <a href="#Regexps">Regexps</a>).  For example, if <code>shell-pushd-regexp</code> matches
the beginning of a shell command line, that line is regarded as a
<code>pushd</code> command.  These commands are recognized only at the
beginning of a shell command line.

   <p><a name="index-dirs-4304"></a>  If Emacs gets confused about changes in the working directory of the
subshell, type <kbd>M-x dirs</kbd>.  This command asks the shell for its
working directory and updates the default directory accordingly.  It
works for shells that support the most common command syntax, but may
not work for unusual shells.

   <p><a name="index-dirtrack_002dmode-4305"></a><a name="index-Dirtrack-mode-4306"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Dirtrack-4307"></a><a name="index-dirtrack_002dlist-4308"></a>  You can also use Dirtrack mode, a buffer-local minor mode that
implements an alternative method of tracking the shell's working
directory.  To use this method, your shell prompt must contain the
working directory at all times, and you must supply a regular
expression for recognizing which part of the prompt contains the
working directory; see the documentation of the variable
<code>dirtrack-list</code> for details.  To use Dirtrack mode, type <kbd>M-x
dirtrack-mode</kbd> in the Shell buffer, or add <code>dirtrack-mode</code> to
<code>shell-mode-hook</code> (see <a href="#Hooks">Hooks</a>).

<p><a name="index-comint_002dscroll_002dto_002dbottom_002don_002dinput-4309"></a>  If the variable <code>comint-scroll-to-bottom-on-input</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>, insertion and yank commands scroll the selected window
to the bottom before inserting.  The default is <code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-comint_002dscroll_002dshow_002dmaximum_002doutput-4310"></a>  If <code>comint-scroll-show-maximum-output</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, then
arrival of output when point is at the end tries to scroll the last
line of text to the bottom line of the window, showing as much useful
text as possible.  (This mimics the scrolling behavior of most
terminals.)  The default is <code>t</code>.

   <p><a name="index-comint_002dmove_002dpoint_002dfor_002doutput-4311"></a>  By setting <code>comint-move-point-for-output</code>, you can opt for
having point jump to the end of the buffer whenever output arrives&mdash;no
matter where in the buffer point was before.  If the value is
<code>this</code>, point jumps in the selected window.  If the value is
<code>all</code>, point jumps in each window that shows the Comint buffer.  If
the value is <code>other</code>, point jumps in all nonselected windows that
show the current buffer.  The default value is <code>nil</code>, which means
point does not jump to the end.

   <p><a name="index-comint_002dprompt_002dread_002donly-4312"></a>  If you set <code>comint-prompt-read-only</code>, the prompts in the Comint
buffer are read-only.

   <p><a name="index-comint_002dinput_002dignoredups-4313"></a>  The variable <code>comint-input-ignoredups</code> controls whether successive
identical inputs are stored in the input history.  A non-<code>nil</code>
value means to omit an input that is the same as the previous input. 
The default is <code>nil</code>, which means to store each input even if it is
equal to the previous input.

   <p><a name="index-comint_002dcompletion_002daddsuffix-4314"></a><a name="index-comint_002dcompletion_002drecexact-4315"></a><a name="index-comint_002dcompletion_002dautolist-4316"></a>  Three variables customize file name completion.  The variable
<code>comint-completion-addsuffix</code> controls whether completion inserts a
space or a slash to indicate a fully completed file or directory name
(non-<code>nil</code> means do insert a space or slash). 
<code>comint-completion-recexact</code>, if non-<code>nil</code>, directs &lt;TAB&gt;
to choose the shortest possible completion if the usual Emacs completion
algorithm cannot add even a single character. 
<code>comint-completion-autolist</code>, if non-<code>nil</code>, says to list all
the possible completions whenever completion is not exact.

   <p><a name="index-shell_002dcompletion_002dexeconly-4317"></a>  Command completion normally considers only executable files. 
If you set <code>shell-completion-execonly</code> to <code>nil</code>,
it considers nonexecutable files as well.

   <p><a name="index-shell_002dcompletion_002dfignore-4318"></a><a name="index-comint_002dcompletion_002dfignore-4319"></a>The variable <code>shell-completion-fignore</code> specifies a list of file
name extensions to ignore in Shell mode completion.  The default
setting is <code>nil</code>, but some users prefer <code>("~" "#" "%")</code> to
ignore file names ending in `<samp><span class="samp">~</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>'.  Other
related Comint modes use the variable <code>comint-completion-fignore</code>
instead.

   <p><a name="index-shell_002ddynamic_002dcomplete_002dcommand-4320"></a>Some implementation details of the shell command completion may also be found

whether `<samp><span class="samp">pushd</span></samp>' behaves like `<samp><span class="samp">cd</span></samp>' if no argument is given
(<code>shell-pushd-tohome</code>), pop rather than rotate with a numeric
argument (<code>shell-pushd-dextract</code>), and only add directories to the

<h3 class="section">40.8 Emacs Terminal Emulator</h3>

<p><a name="index-term-4324"></a>
  To run a subshell in a text terminal emulator, use <kbd>M-x term</kbd>. 
This creates (or reuses) a buffer named <samp><span class="file">*terminal*</span></samp>, and runs a
subshell with input coming from your keyboard, and output going to
that buffer.

   <p><a name="index-line-mode-_0040r_007b_0028terminal-emulator_0029_007d-4325"></a><a name="index-char-mode-_0040r_007b_0028terminal-emulator_0029_007d-4326"></a>  The terminal emulator uses Term mode, which has two input modes.  In
<dfn>line mode</dfn>, Term basically acts like Shell mode (see <a href="#Shell-Mode">Shell Mode</a>).  In <dfn>char mode</dfn>, each character is sent directly to the
subshell, as terminal input; the sole exception is the terminal escape
character, which by default is <kbd>C-c</kbd> (see <a href="#Term-Mode">Term Mode</a>).  Any
echoing of your input is the responsibility of the subshell; any
terminal output from the subshell goes into the buffer, advancing
point.

   <p>Some programs (such as Emacs itself) need to control the appearance
of the terminal screen in detail.  They do this by emitting special
control codes.  Term mode recognizes and handles ANSI-standard
VT100-style escape sequences, which are accepted by most modern
terminals, including <samp><span class="command">xterm</span></samp>.  (Hence, you can actually run
Emacs inside an Emacs Term window.)

   <p>The <code>term</code> face specifies the default appearance of text
in the terminal emulator (the default is the same appearance as the
<code>default</code> face).  When terminal control codes are used to change
the appearance of text, these are represented in the terminal emulator
by the faces <code>term-color-black</code>, <code>term-color-red</code>,
<code>term-color-green</code>, <code>term-color-yellow</code>
<code>term-color-blue</code>, <code>term-color-magenta</code>,
<code>term-color-cyan</code>, <code>term-color-white</code>,
<code>term-color-underline</code>, and <code>term-color-bold</code>. 
See <a href="#Faces">Faces</a>.

   <p>You can also Term mode to communicate with a device connected to a
serial port.  See <a href="#Serial-Terminal">Serial Terminal</a>.

   <p>The file name used to load the subshell is determined the same way
as for Shell mode.  To make multiple terminal emulators, rename the
buffer <samp><span class="file">*terminal*</span></samp> to something different using <kbd>M-x
rename-uniquely</kbd>, just as with Shell mode.

   <p>Unlike Shell mode, Term mode does not track the current directory by
examining your input.  But some shells can tell Term what the current
directory is.  This is done automatically by <code>bash</code> version 1.15
and later.

<h3 class="section">40.9 Term Mode</h3>

<p><a name="index-Term-mode-4327"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Term-4328"></a>
  The terminal emulator uses Term mode, which has two input modes.  In
line mode, Term basically acts like Shell mode (see <a href="#Shell-Mode">Shell Mode</a>). 
In char mode, each character is sent directly to the subshell, except
for the Term escape character, normally <kbd>C-c</kbd>.

   <p>To switch between line and char mode, use these commands:

     
<a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dj-_0040r_007b_0028Term-mode_0029_007d-4329"></a>
<a name="index-term_002dline_002dmode-4330"></a>
<dl><dt><kbd>C-c C-j</kbd><dd>Switch to line mode (<code>term-line-mode</code>).  Do nothing if already in
line mode.

     <p><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dk-_0040r_007b_0028Term-mode_0029_007d-4331"></a><a name="index-term_002dchar_002dmode-4332"></a><br><dt><kbd>C-c C-k</kbd><dd>Switch to char mode (<code>term-char-mode</code>).  Do nothing if already in
char mode. 
</dl>

   <p>The following commands are only available in char mode:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-c C-c</kbd><dd>Send a literal <kbd>C-c</kbd> to the sub-shell.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c </kbd><var>char</var><dd>This is equivalent to <kbd>C-x </kbd><var>char</var> in normal Emacs.  For
example, <kbd>C-c o</kbd> invokes the global binding of <kbd>C-x o</kbd>, which
is normally `<samp><span class="samp">other-window</span></samp>'. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-paging-in-Term-mode-4333"></a>  Term mode has a page-at-a-time feature.  When enabled, it makes
output pause at the end of each screenful:

     
<a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dq-_0040r_007b_0028Term-mode_0029_007d-4334"></a>
<a name="index-term_002dpager_002dtoggle-4335"></a>
<dl><dt><kbd>C-c C-q</kbd><dd>Toggle the page-at-a-time feature.  This command works in both line
and char modes.  When the feature is enabled, the mode-line displays
the word `<samp><span class="samp">page</span></samp>', and each time Term receives more than a
screenful of output, it pauses and displays `<samp><span class="samp">**MORE**</span></samp>' in the
mode-line.  Type &lt;SPC&gt; to display the next screenful of output, or
<kbd>?</kbd> to see your other options.  The interface is similar to the
<code>more</code> program.

  You can login to a remote computer, using whatever commands you
would from a regular terminal (e.g., using the <code>telnet</code> or
<code>rlogin</code> commands), from a Term window.

   <p>A program that asks you for a password will normally suppress
echoing of the password, so the password will not show up in the
buffer.  This will happen just as if you were using a real terminal,
if the buffer is in char mode.  If it is in line mode, the password is
temporarily visible, but will be erased when you hit return.  (This
happens automatically; there is no special password processing.)

   <p>When you log in to a different machine, you need to specify the type
of terminal you're using, by setting the <samp><span class="env">TERM</span></samp> environment
variable in the environment for the remote login command.  (If you use
bash, you do that by writing the variable assignment before the remote
login command, without a separating comma.)  Terminal types
`<samp><span class="samp">ansi</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">vt100</span></samp>' will work on most systems.

  If you have a device connected to a serial port of your computer,
you can communicate with it by typing <kbd>M-x serial-term</kbd>.  This
command asks for a serial port name and speed, and switches to a new
Term mode buffer.  Emacs communicates with the serial device through
this buffer just like it does with a terminal in ordinary Term mode.

   <p>The speed of the serial port is measured in bits per second.  The
most common speed is 9600 bits per second.  You can change the speed
interactively by clicking on the mode line.

   <p>A serial port can be configured even more by clicking on `<samp><span class="samp">8N1</span></samp>' in
the mode line.  By default, a serial port is configured as `<samp><span class="samp">8N1</span></samp>',
which means that each byte consists of 8 data bits, No parity check
bit, and 1 stopbit.

   <p>If the speed or the configuration is wrong, you cannot communicate
with your device and will probably only see garbage output in the
window.

<h2 class="chapter">41 Using Emacs as a Server</h2>

  Various programs can invoke your choice of editor to edit a
particular piece of text.  For instance, version control programs
invoke an editor to enter version control logs (see <a href="#Version-Control">Version Control</a>), and the Unix <samp><span class="command">mail</span></samp> utility invokes an editor to
enter a message to send.  By convention, your choice of editor is
specified by the environment variable <samp><span class="env">EDITOR</span></samp>.  If you set
<samp><span class="env">EDITOR</span></samp> to `<samp><span class="samp">emacs</span></samp>', Emacs would be invoked, but in an
inconvenient way&mdash;by starting a new Emacs process.  This is
inconvenient because the new Emacs process doesn't share buffers, a
command history, or other kinds of information with any existing Emacs
process.

   <p>You can solve this problem by setting up Emacs as an <dfn>edit
server</dfn>, so that it &ldquo;listens&rdquo; for external edit requests and acts
accordingly.  There are two ways to start an Emacs server:

     
<a name="index-server_002dstart-4346"></a>
<ul><li>Run the command <code>server-start</code> in an existing Emacs process:
either type <kbd>M-x server-start</kbd>, or put the expression
<code>(server-start)</code> in your init file (see <a href="#Init-File">Init File</a>).  The
existing Emacs process is the server; when you exit Emacs, the server
dies with the Emacs process.

     <p><a name="index-daemon_002c-Emacs-4347"></a><li>Run Emacs as a <dfn>daemon</dfn>, using the `<samp><span class="samp">--daemon</span></samp>' command-line
option.  See <a href="#Initial-Options">Initial Options</a>.  When Emacs is started this way, it
calls <code>server-start</code> after initialization, and returns control to
the calling terminal instead of opening an initial frame; it then
waits in the background, listening for edit requests. 
</ul>

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040env_007bTEXEDIT_007d-environment-variable-4348"></a>  Either way, once an Emacs server is started, you can use a shell
command called <samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp> to connect to the Emacs process
and tell it to visit a file.  You can then set the <samp><span class="env">EDITOR</span></samp>
environment variable to `<samp><span class="samp">emacsclient</span></samp>', so that external programs
will use the existing Emacs process for editing.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-19" name="fnd-19"><sup>19</sup></a>

   <p><a name="index-server_002dname-4349"></a>  You can run multiple Emacs servers on the same machine by giving
each one a unique <dfn>server name</dfn>, using the variable
<code>server-name</code>.  For example, <kbd>M-x set-variable &lt;RET&gt;
server-name &lt;RET&gt; "foo" &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> sets the server name to
`<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>'.  The <code>emacsclient</code> program can specify a server by
name, using the `<samp><span class="samp">-s</span></samp>' option (see <a href="#emacsclient-Options">emacsclient Options</a>).

   <p>If you want to run multiple Emacs daemons (see <a href="#Initial-Options">Initial Options</a>),
you can give each daemon its own server name like this:

<pre class="example">       emacs --eval "(setq server-name \"foo\")" --daemon
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-server_002deval_002dat-4350"></a>  If you have defined a server by a unique server name, it is possible
to connect to the server from another Emacs instance and evaluate Lisp
expressions on the server, using the <code>server-eval-at</code> function. 
For instance, <code>(server-eval-at "foo" '(+ 1 2))</code> evaluates the
expression <code>(+ 1 2)</code> on the `<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>' server, and returns
<code>3</code>.  (If there is no server with that name, an error is
signaled.)  Currently, this feature is mainly useful for developers.

<h3 class="section">41.1 Invoking <code>emacsclient</code></h3>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bemacsclient_007d-invocation-4351"></a>
  The simplest way to use the <samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp> program is to run
the shell command `<samp><span class="samp">emacsclient </span><var>file</var></samp>', where <var>file</var> is a
file name.  This connects to an Emacs server, and tells that Emacs
process to visit <var>file</var> in one of its existing frames&mdash;either a
graphical frame, or one in a text terminal (see <a href="#Frames">Frames</a>).  You
can then select that frame to begin editing.

   <p>If there is no Emacs server, the <samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp> program halts
with an error message.  If the Emacs process has no existing
frame&mdash;which can happen if it was started as a daemon (see <a href="#Emacs-Server">Emacs Server</a>)&mdash;then Emacs opens a frame on the terminal in which you
called <samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp>.

   <p>You can also force <samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp> to open a new frame on a
graphical display, or on a text terminal, using the `<samp><span class="samp">-c</span></samp>' and
`<samp><span class="samp">-t</span></samp>' options.  See <a href="#emacsclient-Options">emacsclient Options</a>.

   <p>If you are running on a single text terminal, you can switch between
<samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp>'s shell and the Emacs server using one of two
methods: (i) run the Emacs server and <samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp> on
different virtual terminals, and switch to the Emacs server's virtual
terminal after calling <samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp>; or (ii) call
<samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp> from within the Emacs server itself, using Shell
mode (see <a href="#Interactive-Shell">Interactive Shell</a>) or Term mode (see <a href="#Term-Mode">Term Mode</a>);
<code>emacsclient</code> blocks only the subshell under Emacs, and you can
still use Emacs to edit the file.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-_0023-4352"></a><a name="index-server_002dedit-4353"></a>  When you finish editing <var>file</var> in the Emacs server, type
<kbd>C-x #</kbd> (<code>server-edit</code>) in its buffer.  This saves the file
and sends a message back to the <samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp> program, telling
it to exit.  Programs that use <samp><span class="env">EDITOR</span></samp> usually wait for the
editor&mdash;in this case <samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp>&mdash;to exit before doing
something else.

   <p>You can also call <samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp> with multiple file name
arguments: `<samp><span class="samp">emacsclient </span><var>file1</var> <var>file2</var><span class="samp"> ...</span></samp>' tells the
Emacs server to visit <var>file1</var>, <var>file2</var>, and so forth.  Emacs
selects the buffer visiting <var>file1</var>, and buries the other buffers
at the bottom of the buffer list (see <a href="#Buffers">Buffers</a>).  The
<samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp> program exits once all the specified files are
finished (i.e., once you have typed <kbd>C-x #</kbd> in each server
buffer).

   <p><a name="index-server_002dkill_002dnew_002dbuffers-4354"></a><a name="index-server_002dtemp_002dfile_002dregexp-4355"></a>  Finishing with a server buffer also kills the buffer, unless it
already existed in the Emacs session before the server was asked to
create it.  However, if you set <code>server-kill-new-buffers</code> to
<code>nil</code>, then a different criterion is used: finishing with a
server buffer kills it if the file name matches the regular expression
<code>server-temp-file-regexp</code>.  This is set up to distinguish certain
temporary files.

   <p>Each <kbd>C-x #</kbd> checks for other pending external requests to edit
various files, and selects the next such file.  You can switch to a
server buffer manually if you wish; you don't have to arrive at it
with <kbd>C-x #</kbd>.  But <kbd>C-x #</kbd> is the way to tell
<samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp> that you are finished.

   <p><a name="index-server_002dwindow-4356"></a>  If you set the value of the variable <code>server-window</code> to a
window or a frame, <kbd>C-x #</kbd> always displays the next server buffer
in that window or in that frame.

<h3 class="section">41.2 <code>emacsclient</code> Options</h3>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bemacsclient_007d-options-4357"></a>
  You can pass some optional arguments to the <samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp>
program, such as:

<pre class="example">     emacsclient -c +12 <var>file1</var> +4:3 <var>file2</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The `<samp><span class="samp">+</span><var>line</var></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">+</span><var>line</var><span class="samp">:</span><var>column</var></samp>' arguments
specify line numbers, or line and column numbers, for the next file
argument.  These behave like the command line arguments for Emacs
itself.  See <a href="#Action-Arguments">Action Arguments</a>.

   <p>The other optional arguments recognized by <samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp> are
listed below:

     <dl>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">-a </span><var>command</var></samp>'<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--alternate-editor=</span><var>command</var></samp>'<dd>Specify a command to run if <code>emacsclient</code> fails to contact Emacs. 
This is useful when running <code>emacsclient</code> in a script.

     <p>As a special exception, if <var>command</var> is the empty string, then
<code>emacsclient</code> starts Emacs in daemon mode (as <samp><span class="command">emacs
--daemon</span></samp>) and then tries connecting again.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040env_007bALTERNATE_005fEDITOR_007d-environment-variable-4358"></a>The environment variable <samp><span class="env">ALTERNATE_EDITOR</span></samp> has the same effect as
the `<samp><span class="samp">-a</span></samp>' option.  If both are present, the latter takes
precedence.

     <p><a name="index-client-frame-4359"></a><br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">-c</span></samp>'<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--create-frame</span></samp>'<dd>Create a new graphical <dfn>client frame</dfn>, instead of using an
existing Emacs frame.  See below for the special behavior of <kbd>C-x
C-c</kbd> in a client frame.  If Emacs cannot create a new graphical frame
(e.g., if it cannot connect to the X server), it tries to create a
text terminal client frame, as though you had supplied the `<samp><span class="samp">-t</span></samp>'
option instead.

     <p>On MS-Windows, a single Emacs session cannot display frames on both
graphical and text terminals, nor on multiple text terminals.  Thus,
if the Emacs server is running on a text terminal, the `<samp><span class="samp">-c</span></samp>'
option, like the `<samp><span class="samp">-t</span></samp>' option, creates a new frame in the server's
current text terminal.  See <a href="#Windows-Startup">Windows Startup</a>.

     <p>If you omit a filename argument while supplying the `<samp><span class="samp">-c</span></samp>' option,
the new frame displays the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer by default.  You
can customize this behavior with the variable <code>initial-buffer-choice</code>
(see <a href="#Entering-Emacs">Entering Emacs</a>).

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">-F </span><var>alist</var></samp>'<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--frame-parameters=</span><var>alist</var></samp>'<dd>Set the parameters for a newly-created graphical frame
(see <a href="#Frame-Parameters">Frame Parameters</a>).

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">-d </span><var>display</var></samp>'<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--display=</span><var>display</var></samp>'<dd>Tell Emacs to open the given files on the X display <var>display</var>
(assuming there is more than one X display available).

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">-e</span></samp>'<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--eval</span></samp>'<dd>Tell Emacs to evaluate some Emacs Lisp code, instead of visiting some
files.  When this option is given, the arguments to
<samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp> are interpreted as a list of expressions to
evaluate, <em>not</em> as a list of files to visit.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">-f </span><var>server-file</var></samp>'<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--server-file=</span><var>server-file</var></samp>'<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040env_007bEMACS_005fSERVER_005fFILE_007d-environment-variable-4360"></a>Specify a <dfn>server file</dfn> for connecting to an Emacs server via TCP.

     <p>An Emacs server usually uses a
local socket to listen for connections.  Some operating systems,
such as Microsoft Windows, do not support local sockets; in that case,
the server communicates with <samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp> via TCP.

     <p><a name="index-server_002dauth_002ddir-4361"></a><a name="index-server-file-4362"></a><a name="index-server_002dport-4363"></a>When you start a TCP Emacs server, Emacs creates a <dfn>server file</dfn>
containing the TCP information to be used by <samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp> to
connect to the server.  The variable <code>server-auth-dir</code> specifies
the directory containing the server file; by default, this is
<samp><span class="file">~/.emacs.d/server/</span></samp>.  To tell <samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp> to connect
to the server over TCP with a specific server file, use the `<samp><span class="samp">-f</span></samp>'
or `<samp><span class="samp">--server-file</span></samp>' option, or set the <samp><span class="env">EMACS_SERVER_FILE</span></samp>
environment variable.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">-n</span></samp>'<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--no-wait</span></samp>'<dd>Let <samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp> exit immediately, instead of waiting until
all server buffers are finished.  You can take as long as you like to
edit the server buffers within Emacs, and they are <em>not</em> killed
when you type <kbd>C-x #</kbd> in them.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--parent-id </span><var>id</var></samp>'<dd>Open an <samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp> frame as a client frame in the parent X
window with id <var>id</var>, via the XEmbed protocol.  Currently, this
option is mainly useful for developers.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">-q</span></samp>'<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--quiet</span></samp>'<dd>Do not let <samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp> display messages about waiting for
Emacs or connecting to remote server sockets.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">-s </span><var>server-name</var></samp>'<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--socket-name=</span><var>server-name</var></samp>'<dd>Connect to the Emacs server named <var>server-name</var>.  The server name
is given by the variable <code>server-name</code> on the Emacs server.  If
this option is omitted, <samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp> connects to the first
server it finds.  (This option is not supported on MS-Windows.)

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">-t</span></samp>'<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--tty</span></samp>'<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">-nw</span></samp>'<dd>Create a new client frame on the current text terminal, instead of
using an existing Emacs frame.  This behaves just like the `<samp><span class="samp">-c</span></samp>'
option, described above, except that it creates a text terminal frame
(see <a href="#Non_002dWindow-Terminals">Non-Window Terminals</a>).

     <p>On MS-Windows, `<samp><span class="samp">-t</span></samp>' behaves just like `<samp><span class="samp">-c</span></samp>' if the Emacs
server is using the graphical display, but if the Emacs server is
running on a text terminal, it creates a new frame in the current text
terminal. 
</dl>

   <p>The new graphical or text terminal frames created by the `<samp><span class="samp">-c</span></samp>'
or `<samp><span class="samp">-t</span></samp>' options are considered <dfn>client frames</dfn>.  Any new
frame that you create from a client frame is also considered a client
frame.  If you type <kbd>C-x C-c</kbd> (<code>save-buffers-kill-terminal</code>)
in a client frame, that command does not kill the Emacs session as it
normally does (see <a href="#Exiting">Exiting</a>).  Instead, Emacs deletes the client
frame; furthermore, if the client frame has an <samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp>
waiting to regain control (i.e., if you did not supply the `<samp><span class="samp">-n</span></samp>'
option), Emacs deletes all other frames of the same client, and marks
the client's server buffers as finished, as though you had typed
<kbd>C-x #</kbd> in all of them.  If it so happens that there are no
remaining frames after the client frame(s) are deleted, the Emacs
session exits.

   <p>As an exception, when Emacs is started as a daemon, all frames are
considered client frames, and <kbd>C-x C-c</kbd> never kills Emacs.  To
kill a daemon session, type <kbd>M-x kill-emacs</kbd>.

   <p>Note that the `<samp><span class="samp">-t</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">-n</span></samp>' options are contradictory:
`<samp><span class="samp">-t</span></samp>' says to take control of the current text terminal to create
a new client frame, while `<samp><span class="samp">-n</span></samp>' says not to take control of the
text terminal.  If you supply both options, Emacs visits the specified
files(s) in an existing frame rather than a new client frame, negating
the effect of `<samp><span class="samp">-t</span></samp>'.

<h2 class="chapter">42 Printing Hard Copies</h2>

<p><a name="index-hardcopy-4364"></a><a name="index-printing-4365"></a>
  Emacs provides commands for printing hardcopies of either an entire
buffer or part of one.  You can invoke the printing commands directly,
as detailed below, or using the `<samp><span class="samp">File</span></samp>' menu on the menu bar.

   <p><a name="index-htmlfontify_002dbuffer-4366"></a>  Aside from the commands described in this section, you can also
print hardcopies from Dired (see <a href="#Operating-on-Files">Operating on Files</a>) and the diary
(see <a href="#Displaying-the-Diary">Displaying the Diary</a>).  You can also &ldquo;print&rdquo; an Emacs
buffer to HTML with the command <kbd>M-x htmlfontify-buffer</kbd>, which
converts the current buffer to a HTML file, replacing Emacs faces with
CSS-based markup.  Furthermore, Org mode allows you to print Org
files to a variety of formats, such as PDF (see <a href="#Org-Mode">Org Mode</a>).

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-x print-buffer</kbd><dd>Print hardcopy of current buffer with page headings containing the
file name and page number. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x lpr-buffer</kbd><dd>Print hardcopy of current buffer without page headings. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x print-region</kbd><dd>Like <code>print-buffer</code> but print only the current region. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x lpr-region</kbd><dd>Like <code>lpr-buffer</code> but print only the current region. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-print_002dbuffer-4367"></a><a name="index-print_002dregion-4368"></a><a name="index-lpr_002dbuffer-4369"></a><a name="index-lpr_002dregion-4370"></a><a name="index-lpr_002dswitches-4371"></a><a name="index-lpr_002dcommands-4372"></a>  On most operating system, the above hardcopy commands submit files
for printing by calling the <samp><span class="command">lpr</span></samp> program.  To change the
printer program, customize the variable <code>lpr-command</code>.  To
specify extra switches to give the printer program, customize the list
variable <code>lpr-switches</code>.  Its value should be a list of option
strings, each of which should start with `<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>' (e.g., the option
string <code>"-w80"</code> specifies a line width of 80 columns).  The
default is the empty list, <code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-printer_002dname-4373"></a><a name="index-lpr_002dprinter_002dswitch-4374"></a>  To specify the printer to use, set the variable <code>printer-name</code>. 
The default, <code>nil</code>, specifies the default printer.  If you set it
to a printer name (a string), that name is passed to <samp><span class="command">lpr</span></samp>
with the `<samp><span class="samp">-P</span></samp>' switch; if you are not using <samp><span class="command">lpr</span></samp>, you
should specify the switch with <code>lpr-printer-switch</code>.

   <p><a name="index-lpr_002dheaders_002dswitches-4375"></a><a name="index-lpr_002dadd_002dswitches-4376"></a>  The variable <code>lpr-headers-switches</code> similarly specifies the
extra switches to use to make page headers.  The variable
<code>lpr-add-switches</code> controls whether to supply `<samp><span class="samp">-T</span></samp>' and
`<samp><span class="samp">-J</span></samp>' options (suitable for <samp><span class="command">lpr</span></samp>) to the printer program:
<code>nil</code> means don't add them (this should be the value if your
printer program is not compatible with <samp><span class="command">lpr</span></samp>).

buffer contents in PostScript form.  One command prints the entire
buffer; the other, just the region.  The commands
<code>ps-print-buffer-with-faces</code> and
<code>ps-print-region-with-faces</code> behave similarly, but use PostScript
features to show the faces (fonts and colors) of the buffer text.

   <p>Interactively, when you use a prefix argument (<kbd>C-u</kbd>), the command
prompts the user for a file name, and saves the PostScript image in that file
instead of sending it to the printer.

   <p><a name="index-ps_002dspool_002dregion-4381"></a><a name="index-ps_002dspool_002dbuffer-4382"></a><a name="index-ps_002dspool_002dregion_002dwith_002dfaces-4383"></a><a name="index-ps_002dspool_002dbuffer_002dwith_002dfaces-4384"></a>  The commands whose names have `<samp><span class="samp">spool</span></samp>' instead of `<samp><span class="samp">print</span></samp>',
generate the PostScript output in an Emacs buffer instead of sending
it to the printer.

   <p><a name="index-ps_002ddespool-4385"></a>  Use the command <code>ps-despool</code> to send the spooled images to the
printer.  This command sends the PostScript generated by
`<samp><span class="samp">-spool-</span></samp>' commands (see commands above) to the printer.  With a
prefix argument (<kbd>C-u</kbd>), it prompts for a file name, and saves the
spooled PostScript image in that file instead of sending it to the
printer.

   <p><a name="index-handwrite-4386"></a><a name="index-handwriting-4387"></a>  <kbd>M-x handwrite</kbd> is more frivolous.  It generates a PostScript
rendition of the current buffer as a cursive handwritten document.  It
can be customized in group <code>handwrite</code>.  This function only
supports ISO 8859-1 characters.

<h3 class="section">42.2 Variables for PostScript Hardcopy</h3>

<p><a name="index-ps_002dlpr_002dcommand-4388"></a><a name="index-ps_002dlpr_002dswitches-4389"></a><a name="index-ps_002dprinter_002dname-4390"></a>  All the PostScript hardcopy commands use the variables
<code>ps-lpr-command</code> and <code>ps-lpr-switches</code> to specify how to print
the output.  <code>ps-lpr-command</code> specifies the command name to run,
<code>ps-lpr-switches</code> specifies command line options to use, and
<code>ps-printer-name</code> specifies the printer.  If you don't set the
first two variables yourself, they take their initial values from
<code>lpr-command</code> and <code>lpr-switches</code>.  If <code>ps-printer-name</code>
is <code>nil</code>, <code>printer-name</code> is used.

   <p><a name="index-ps_002dprint_002dheader-4391"></a>  The variable <code>ps-print-header</code> controls whether these commands
add header lines to each page&mdash;set it to <code>nil</code> to turn headers
off.

   <p><a name="index-color-emulation-on-black_002dand_002dwhite-printers-4392"></a><a name="index-ps_002dprint_002dcolor_002dp-4393"></a>  If your printer doesn't support colors, you should turn off color
processing by setting <code>ps-print-color-p</code> to <code>nil</code>.  By
default, if the display supports colors, Emacs produces hardcopy output
with color information; on black-and-white printers, colors are emulated
with shades of gray.  This might produce illegible output, even if your
screen colors only use shades of gray.

   <p>Alternatively, you can set <code>ps-print-color-p</code> to <code>black-white</code> to
print colors on black/white printers.

   <p><a name="index-ps_002duse_002dface_002dbackground-4394"></a>  By default, PostScript printing ignores the background colors of the
faces, unless the variable <code>ps-use-face-background</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>.  This is to avoid unwanted interference with the zebra
stripes and background image/text.

   <p><a name="index-ps_002dpaper_002dtype-4395"></a><a name="index-ps_002dpage_002ddimensions_002ddatabase-4396"></a>  The variable <code>ps-paper-type</code> specifies which size of paper to
format for; legitimate values include <code>a4</code>, <code>a3</code>,
<code>a4small</code>, <code>b4</code>, <code>b5</code>, <code>executive</code>, <code>ledger</code>,
<code>legal</code>, <code>letter</code>, <code>letter-small</code>, <code>statement</code>,
<code>tabloid</code>.  The default is <code>letter</code>.  You can define
additional paper sizes by changing the variable
<code>ps-page-dimensions-database</code>.

   <p><a name="index-ps_002dlandscape_002dmode-4397"></a>  The variable <code>ps-landscape-mode</code> specifies the orientation of
printing on the page.  The default is <code>nil</code>, which stands for
portrait mode.  Any non-<code>nil</code> value specifies landscape
mode.

   <p><a name="index-ps_002dnumber_002dof_002dcolumns-4398"></a>  The variable <code>ps-number-of-columns</code> specifies the number of
columns; it takes effect in both landscape and portrait mode.  The
default is 1.

   <p><a name="index-ps_002dfont_002dfamily-4399"></a><a name="index-ps_002dfont_002dsize-4400"></a><a name="index-ps_002dfont_002dinfo_002ddatabase-4401"></a>  The variable <code>ps-font-family</code> specifies which font family to use
for printing ordinary text.  Legitimate values include <code>Courier</code>,
<code>Helvetica</code>, <code>NewCenturySchlbk</code>, <code>Palatino</code> and
<code>Times</code>.  The variable <code>ps-font-size</code> specifies the size of
the font for ordinary text.  It defaults to 8.5 points.

   <p><a name="index-ps_002dmultibyte_002dbuffer-4402"></a><a name="index-Intlfonts-for-PostScript-printing-4403"></a><a name="index-fonts-for-PostScript-printing-4404"></a>  Emacs supports more scripts and characters than a typical PostScript
printer.  Thus, some of the characters in your buffer might not be
printable using the fonts built into your printer.  You can augment
the fonts supplied with the printer with those from the GNU Intlfonts
package, or you can instruct Emacs to use Intlfonts exclusively.  The
variable <code>ps-multibyte-buffer</code> controls this: the default value,
<code>nil</code>, is appropriate for printing <acronym>ASCII</acronym> and Latin-1
characters; a value of <code>non-latin-printer</code> is for printers which
have the fonts for <acronym>ASCII</acronym>, Latin-1, Japanese, and Korean
characters built into them.  A value of <code>bdf-font</code> arranges for
the BDF fonts from the Intlfonts package to be used for <em>all</em>
characters.  Finally, a value of <code>bdf-font-except-latin</code>
instructs the printer to use built-in fonts for <acronym>ASCII</acronym> and Latin-1
characters, and Intlfonts BDF fonts for the rest.

   <p><a name="index-bdf_002ddirectory_002dlist-4405"></a>  To be able to use the BDF fonts, Emacs needs to know where to find
them.  The variable <code>bdf-directory-list</code> holds the list of
directories where Emacs should look for the fonts; the default value
includes a single directory <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/share/emacs/fonts/bdf</span></samp>.

   <p>Many other customization variables for these commands are defined and
described in the Lisp files <samp><span class="file">ps-print.el</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">ps-mule.el</span></samp>.

<h3 class="section">42.3 Printing Package</h3>

<p><a name="index-Printing-package-4406"></a>
  The basic Emacs facilities for printing hardcopy can be extended
using the Printing package.  This provides an easy-to-use interface
for choosing what to print, previewing PostScript files before
printing, and setting various printing options such as print headers,
landscape or portrait modes, duplex modes, and so forth.  On GNU/Linux
or Unix systems, the Printing package relies on the <samp><span class="file">gs</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">gv</span></samp> utilities, which are distributed as part of the GhostScript
program.  On MS-Windows, the <samp><span class="file">gstools</span></samp> port of Ghostscript can be
used.

   <p><a name="index-pr_002dinterface-4407"></a>  To use the Printing package, add <code>(require 'printing)</code> to your
init file (see <a href="#Init-File">Init File</a>), followed by <code>(pr-update-menus)</code>. 
This function replaces the usual printing commands in the menu bar
with a `<samp><span class="samp">Printing</span></samp>' submenu that contains various printing options. 
You can also type <kbd>M-x pr-interface &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>; this creates a
<samp><span class="file">*Printing Interface*</span></samp> buffer, similar to a customization buffer,
where you can set the printing options.  After selecting what and how
to print, you start the print job using the `<samp><span class="samp">Print</span></samp>' button (click
<kbd>mouse-2</kbd> on it, or move point over it and type &lt;RET&gt;).  For
further information on the various options, use the `<samp><span class="samp">Interface
Help</span></samp>' button.

<h2 class="chapter">43 Sorting Text</h2>

<p><a name="index-sorting-4408"></a>
  Emacs provides several commands for sorting text in the buffer.  All
operate on the contents of the region. 
They divide the text of the region into many <dfn>sort records</dfn>,
identify a <dfn>sort key</dfn> for each record, and then reorder the records
into the order determined by the sort keys.  The records are ordered so
that their keys are in alphabetical order, or, for numeric sorting, in
numeric order.  In alphabetic sorting, all upper-case letters `<samp><span class="samp">A</span></samp>'
through `<samp><span class="samp">Z</span></samp>' come before lower-case `<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>', in accordance with the
<acronym>ASCII</acronym> character sequence.

   <p>The various sort commands differ in how they divide the text into sort
records and in which part of each record is used as the sort key.  Most of
the commands make each line a separate sort record, but some commands use
paragraphs or pages as sort records.  Most of the sort commands use each
entire sort record as its own sort key, but some use only a portion of the
record as the sort key.

   <p><a name="index-sort_002dlines-4409"></a><a name="index-sort_002dparagraphs-4410"></a><a name="index-sort_002dpages-4411"></a><a name="index-sort_002dfields-4412"></a><a name="index-sort_002dnumeric_002dfields-4413"></a><a name="index-sort_002dnumeric_002dbase-4414"></a>
     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-x sort-lines</kbd><dd>Divide the region into lines, and sort by comparing the entire
text of a line.  A numeric argument means sort into descending order.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x sort-paragraphs</kbd><dd>Divide the region into paragraphs, and sort by comparing the entire
text of a paragraph (except for leading blank lines).  A numeric
argument means sort into descending order.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x sort-pages</kbd><dd>Divide the region into pages, and sort by comparing the entire
text of a page (except for leading blank lines).  A numeric
argument means sort into descending order.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x sort-fields</kbd><dd>Divide the region into lines, and sort by comparing the contents of
one field in each line.  Fields are defined as separated by
whitespace, so the first run of consecutive non-whitespace characters
in a line constitutes field 1, the second such run constitutes field
2, etc.

     <p>Specify which field to sort by with a numeric argument: 1 to sort by
field 1, etc.  A negative argument means count fields from the right
instead of from the left; thus, minus 1 means sort by the last field. 
If several lines have identical contents in the field being sorted, they
keep the same relative order that they had in the original buffer.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x sort-numeric-fields</kbd><dd>Like <kbd>M-x sort-fields</kbd> except the specified field is converted
to an integer for each line, and the numbers are compared.  `<samp><span class="samp">10</span></samp>'
comes before `<samp><span class="samp">2</span></samp>' when considered as text, but after it when
considered as a number.  By default, numbers are interpreted according
to <code>sort-numeric-base</code>, but numbers beginning with `<samp><span class="samp">0x</span></samp>' or
`<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>' are interpreted as hexadecimal and octal, respectively.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x sort-columns</kbd><dd>Like <kbd>M-x sort-fields</kbd> except that the text within each line
used for comparison comes from a fixed range of columns.  With a
prefix argument, sort in reverse order.  See below for more details
on this command.

     <p><a name="index-reverse_002dregion-4415"></a><br><dt><kbd>M-x reverse-region</kbd><dd>Reverse the order of the lines in the region.  This is useful for
sorting into descending order by fields, since those sort
commands do not have a feature for doing that. 
</dl>

   <p>For example, if the buffer contains this:

<pre class="smallexample">     On systems where clash detection (locking of files being edited) is
     implemented, Emacs also checks the first time you modify a buffer
     whether the file has changed on disk since it was last visited or
     saved.  If it has, you are asked to confirm that you want to change
     the buffer.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">applying <kbd>M-x sort-lines</kbd> to the entire buffer produces this:

<pre class="smallexample">     On systems where clash detection (locking of files being edited) is
     implemented, Emacs also checks the first time you modify a buffer
     saved.  If it has, you are asked to confirm that you want to change
     the buffer.
     whether the file has changed on disk since it was last visited or
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where the upper-case `<samp><span class="samp">O</span></samp>' sorts before all lower-case letters.  If
you use <kbd>C-u 2 M-x sort-fields</kbd> instead, you get this:

<pre class="smallexample">     implemented, Emacs also checks the first time you modify a buffer
     saved.  If it has, you are asked to confirm that you want to change
     the buffer.
     On systems where clash detection (locking of files being edited) is
     whether the file has changed on disk since it was last visited or
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where the sort keys were `<samp><span class="samp">Emacs</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">If</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">buffer</span></samp>',
`<samp><span class="samp">systems</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">the</span></samp>'.

   <p><a name="index-sort_002dcolumns-4416"></a>  <kbd>M-x sort-columns</kbd> requires more explanation.  You specify the
columns by putting point at one of the columns and the mark at the other
column.  Because this means you cannot put point or the mark at the
beginning of the first line of the text you want to sort, this command
uses an unusual definition of &ldquo;region&rdquo;: all of the line point is in is
considered part of the region, and so is all of the line the mark is in,
as well as all the lines in between.

   <p>For example, to sort a table by information found in columns 10 to 15,
you could put the mark on column 10 in the first line of the table, and
point on column 15 in the last line of the table, and then run
<code>sort-columns</code>.  Equivalently, you could run it with the mark on
column 15 in the first line and point on column 10 in the last line.

   <p>This can be thought of as sorting the rectangle specified by point and
the mark, except that the text on each line to the left or right of the
rectangle moves along with the text inside the rectangle. 
See <a href="#Rectangles">Rectangles</a>.

   <p><a name="index-sort_002dfold_002dcase-4417"></a>  Many of the sort commands ignore case differences when comparing, if
<code>sort-fold-case</code> is non-<code>nil</code>.

<h2 class="chapter">44 Editing Pictures</h2>

<p><a name="index-pictures-4418"></a><a name="index-making-pictures-out-of-text-characters-4419"></a><a name="index-picture_002dmode-4420"></a>
  To edit a picture made out of text characters (for example, a picture
of the division of a register into fields, as a comment in a program),
use the command <kbd>M-x picture-mode</kbd> to enter Picture mode.

   <p>In Picture mode, editing is based on the <dfn>quarter-plane</dfn> model of
text, according to which the text characters lie studded on an area that
stretches infinitely far to the right and downward.  The concept of the end
of a line does not exist in this model; the most you can say is where the
last nonblank character on the line is found.

   <p>Of course, Emacs really always considers text as a sequence of
characters, and lines really do have ends.  But Picture mode replaces
the most frequently-used commands with variants that simulate the
quarter-plane model of text.  They do this by inserting spaces or by
converting tabs to spaces.

   <p>Most of the basic editing commands of Emacs are redefined by Picture mode
to do essentially the same thing but in a quarter-plane way.  In addition,
Picture mode defines various keys starting with the <kbd>C-c</kbd> prefix to
run special picture editing commands.

   <p>One of these keys, <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>, is particularly important.  Often
a picture is part of a larger file that is usually edited in some
other major mode.  Picture mode records the name of the previous major
mode so you can use the <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> command
(<code>picture-mode-exit</code>) later to go back to that mode.  <kbd>C-c
C-c</kbd> also deletes spaces from the ends of lines, unless given a
numeric argument.

   <p>The special commands of Picture mode all work in other modes (provided
the <samp><span class="file">picture</span></samp> library is loaded), but are not bound to keys except
in Picture mode.  The descriptions below talk of moving &ldquo;one column&rdquo;
and so on, but all the picture mode commands handle numeric arguments as
their normal equivalents do.

   <p><a name="index-picture_002dmode_002dhook-4421"></a>  Turning on Picture mode runs the hook <code>picture-mode-hook</code>. 
Additional extensions to Picture mode can be found in
<samp><span class="file">artist.el</span></samp>.

  Most keys do the same thing in Picture mode that they usually do, but
do it in a quarter-plane style.  For example, <kbd>C-f</kbd> is rebound to
run <code>picture-forward-column</code>, a command which moves point one
column to the right, inserting a space if necessary so that the actual
end of the line makes no difference.  <kbd>C-b</kbd> is rebound to run
<code>picture-backward-column</code>, which always moves point left one
column, converting a tab to multiple spaces if necessary.  <kbd>C-n</kbd> and
<kbd>C-p</kbd> are rebound to run <code>picture-move-down</code> and
<code>picture-move-up</code>, which can either insert spaces or convert tabs
as necessary to make sure that point stays in exactly the same column. 
<kbd>C-e</kbd> runs <code>picture-end-of-line</code>, which moves to after the last
nonblank character on the line.  <kbd>C-a</kbd> runs
<code>picture-beginning-of-line</code>.  (The choice of screen model does not
affect beginnings of lines; the only extra thing this command does is
update the current picture column to 0.)

   <p><a name="index-picture_002dnewline-4427"></a>  Insertion of text is adapted to the quarter-plane screen model
through the use of Overwrite mode
(see <a href="#Minor-Modes">Minor Modes</a>.) 
Self-inserting characters replace existing text, column by column,
rather than pushing existing text to the right.  &lt;RET&gt; runs
<code>picture-newline</code>, which just moves to the beginning of the
following line so that new text will replace that line.

   <p><a name="index-picture_002dbackward_002dclear_002dcolumn-4428"></a><a name="index-picture_002dclear_002dcolumn-4429"></a><a name="index-picture_002dclear_002dline-4430"></a>  In Picture mode, the commands that normally delete or kill text,
instead erase text (replacing it with spaces).  &lt;DEL&gt;
(<code>picture-backward-clear-column</code>) replaces the preceding
character with a space rather than removing it; this moves point
backwards.  <kbd>C-d</kbd> (<code>picture-clear-column</code>) replaces the next
character or characters with spaces, but does not move point.  (If you
want to clear characters to spaces and move forward over them, use
&lt;SPC&gt;.)  <kbd>C-k</kbd> (<code>picture-clear-line</code>) really kills the
contents of lines, but does not delete the newlines from the buffer.

   <p><a name="index-picture_002dopen_002dline-4431"></a>  To do actual insertion, you must use special commands.  <kbd>C-o</kbd>
(<code>picture-open-line</code>) creates a blank line after the current
line; it never splits a line.  <kbd>C-M-o</kbd> (<code>split-line</code>) makes
sense in Picture mode, so it is not changed.  <kbd>C-j</kbd>
(<code>picture-duplicate-line</code>) inserts another line with the same
contents below the current line.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dd-_0040r_007b_0028Picture-mode_0029_007d-4432"></a>   To do actual deletion in Picture mode, use <kbd>C-w</kbd>, <kbd>C-c C-d</kbd>
(which is defined as <code>delete-char</code>, as <kbd>C-d</kbd> is in other
modes), or one of the picture rectangle commands (see <a href="#Rectangles-in-Picture">Rectangles in Picture</a>).

point, there is no essential restriction on how point should be moved. 
Normally point moves right, but you can specify any of the eight
orthogonal or diagonal directions for motion after a self-inserting
character.  This is useful for drawing lines in the buffer.

<kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> (<code>picture-tab-search</code>) for context-based tabbing. 
With no argument, it moves to a point underneath the next
&ldquo;interesting&rdquo; character that follows whitespace in the previous
nonblank line.  &ldquo;Next&rdquo; here means &ldquo;appearing at a horizontal position
greater than the one point starts out at&rdquo;.  With an argument, as in
<kbd>C-u M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>, this command moves to the next such interesting
character in the current line.  <kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> does not change the
text; it only moves point.  &ldquo;Interesting&rdquo; characters are defined by
the variable <code>picture-tab-chars</code>, which should define a set of
characters.  The syntax for this variable is like the syntax used inside
of `<samp><span class="samp">[...]</span></samp>' in a regular expression&mdash;but without the `<samp><span class="samp">[</span></samp>'
and the `<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>'.  Its default value is <code>"!-~"</code>.

   <p><a name="index-picture_002dtab-4456"></a>  &lt;TAB&gt; itself runs <code>picture-tab</code>, which operates based on the
current tab stop settings; it is the Picture mode equivalent of
<code>tab-to-tab-stop</code>.  Normally it just moves point, but with a numeric
argument it clears the text that it moves over.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dc-TAB-_0040r_007b_0028Picture-mode_0029_007d-4457"></a><a name="index-picture_002dset_002dtab_002dstops-4458"></a>  The context-based and tab-stop-based forms of tabbing are brought
together by the command <kbd>C-c &lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> (<code>picture-set-tab-stops</code>). 
This command sets the tab stops to the positions which <kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>
would consider significant in the current line.  The use of this command,
together with &lt;TAB&gt;, can get the effect of context-based tabbing.  But
<kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> is more convenient in the cases where it is sufficient.

   <p>It may be convenient to prevent use of actual tab characters in
pictures.  For example, this prevents <kbd>C-x &lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> from messing
up the picture.  You can do this by setting the variable
<code>indent-tabs-mode</code> to <code>nil</code>.

<h3 class="section">44.4 Picture Mode Rectangle Commands</h3>

<p><a name="index-rectangles-and-Picture-mode-4459"></a><a name="index-Picture-mode-and-rectangles-4460"></a>
  Picture mode defines commands for working on rectangular pieces of
the text in ways that fit with the quarter-plane model.  The standard
rectangle commands may also be useful. 
See <a href="#Rectangles">Rectangles</a>.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-c C-k</kbd><dd>Clear out the region-rectangle with spaces
(<code>picture-clear-rectangle</code>).  With a prefix argument, delete the
text. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-c C-w </kbd><var>r</var><dd>Similar, but save rectangle contents in register <var>r</var> first
(<code>picture-clear-rectangle-to-register</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-c C-y</kbd><dd>Copy last killed rectangle into the buffer by overwriting, with upper
left corner at point (<code>picture-yank-rectangle</code>).  With argument,
insert instead. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-c C-x </kbd><var>r</var><dd>Similar, but use the rectangle in register <var>r</var>
(<code>picture-yank-rectangle-from-register</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dk-_0040r_007b_0028Picture-mode_0029_007d-4461"></a><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dw-_0040r_007b_0028Picture-mode_0029_007d-4462"></a><a name="index-picture_002dclear_002drectangle-4463"></a><a name="index-picture_002dclear_002drectangle_002dto_002dregister-4464"></a>  The picture rectangle commands <kbd>C-c C-k</kbd>
(<code>picture-clear-rectangle</code>) and <kbd>C-c C-w</kbd>
(<code>picture-clear-rectangle-to-register</code>) differ from the standard
rectangle commands in that they normally clear the rectangle instead of
deleting it; this is analogous with the way <kbd>C-d</kbd> is changed in Picture
mode.

   <p>However, deletion of rectangles can be useful in Picture mode, so
these commands delete the rectangle if given a numeric argument. 
<kbd>C-c C-k</kbd> either with or without a numeric argument saves the
rectangle for <kbd>C-c C-y</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dy-_0040r_007b_0028Picture-mode_0029_007d-4465"></a><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dx-_0040r_007b_0028Picture-mode_0029_007d-4466"></a><a name="index-picture_002dyank_002drectangle-4467"></a><a name="index-picture_002dyank_002drectangle_002dfrom_002dregister-4468"></a>  The Picture mode commands for yanking rectangles differ from the
standard ones in that they overwrite instead of inserting.  This is
the same way that Picture mode insertion of other text differs from
other modes.  <kbd>C-c C-y</kbd> (<code>picture-yank-rectangle</code>) inserts
(by overwriting) the rectangle that was most recently killed, while
<kbd>C-c C-x</kbd> (<code>picture-yank-rectangle-from-register</code>) does
likewise for the rectangle found in a specified register.

use it, use <kbd>M-x hexl-find-file</kbd> instead of <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> to visit
the file.  This command converts the file's contents to hexadecimal and
lets you edit the translation.  When you save the file, it is converted
automatically back to binary.

   <p>You can also use <kbd>M-x hexl-mode</kbd> to translate an existing buffer
into hex.  This is useful if you visit a file normally and then discover
it is a binary file.

   <p>Ordinary text characters overwrite in Hexl mode.  This is to reduce
the risk of accidentally spoiling the alignment of data in the file. 
There are special commands for insertion.  Here is a list of the
commands of Hexl mode:

<!-- I don't think individual index entries for these commands are useful-RMS. -->
<dl>
<dt><kbd>C-M-d</kbd><dd>Insert a byte with a code typed in decimal.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-M-o</kbd><dd>Insert a byte with a code typed in octal.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-M-x</kbd><dd>Insert a byte with a code typed in hex.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-x [</kbd><dd>Move to the beginning of a 1k-byte page.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-x ]</kbd><dd>Move to the end of a 1k-byte page.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-g</kbd><dd>Move to an address specified in hex.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-j</kbd><dd>Move to an address specified in decimal.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-c</kbd><dd>Leave Hexl mode, going back to the major mode this buffer had before you
invoked <code>hexl-mode</code>. 
</dl>

<p class="noindent">Other Hexl commands let you insert strings (sequences) of binary
bytes, move by <code>short</code>s or <code>int</code>s, etc.; type <kbd>C-h a
hexl-&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> for details.

<h2 class="chapter">46 Saving Emacs Sessions</h2>

<p><a name="index-saving-sessions-4473"></a><a name="index-restore-session-4474"></a><a name="index-remember-editing-session-4475"></a><a name="index-reload-files-4476"></a><a name="index-desktop-4477"></a>
<a name="index-desktop_002drestore_002dframes-4478"></a>   Use the desktop library to save the state of Emacs from one session
to another.  Once you save the Emacs <dfn>desktop</dfn>&mdash;the buffers,
their file names, major modes, buffer positions, and so on&mdash;then
subsequent Emacs sessions reload the saved desktop.  By default,
the desktop also tries to save the frame and window configuration. 
To disable this, set <code>desktop-restore-frames</code> to <code>nil</code>. 
(See that variable's documentation for some related options
that you can customize to fine-tune this behavior.)

   <p><a name="index-desktop_002dsave-4479"></a><a name="index-desktop_002dsave_002dmode-4480"></a>  You can save the desktop manually with the command <kbd>M-x
desktop-save</kbd>.  You can also enable automatic saving of the desktop
when you exit Emacs, and automatic restoration of the last saved
desktop when Emacs starts: use the Customization buffer (see <a href="#Easy-Customization">Easy Customization</a>) to set <code>desktop-save-mode</code> to <code>t</code> for future
sessions, or add this line in your init file (see <a href="#Init-File">Init File</a>):

<pre class="example">     (desktop-save-mode 1)
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-desktop_002dauto_002dsave_002dtimeout-4481"></a>When <code>desktop-save-mode</code> is active and the desktop file exists,
Emacs auto-saves it every <code>desktop-auto-save-timeout</code>
seconds, if that is non-<code>nil</code> and non-zero.

   <p><a name="index-desktop_002dchange_002ddir-4482"></a><a name="index-desktop_002drevert-4483"></a><a name="index-desktop_002dpath-4484"></a>  If you turn on <code>desktop-save-mode</code> in your init file, then when
Emacs starts, it looks for a saved desktop in the current directory. 
(More precisely, it looks in the directories specified by
<var>desktop-path</var>, and uses the first desktop it finds.) 
Thus, you can have separate saved desktops in different directories,
and the starting directory determines which one Emacs reloads.  You
can save the current desktop and reload one saved in another directory
by typing <kbd>M-x desktop-change-dir</kbd>.  Typing <kbd>M-x
desktop-revert</kbd> reverts to the desktop previously reloaded.

   <p>Specify the option `<samp><span class="samp">--no-desktop</span></samp>' on the command line when you
don't want it to reload any saved desktop.  This turns off
<code>desktop-save-mode</code> for the current session.  Starting Emacs with
the `<samp><span class="samp">--no-init-file</span></samp>' option also disables desktop reloading,
since it bypasses the init file, where <code>desktop-save-mode</code> is
usually turned on.

   <p><a name="index-desktop_002drestore_002deager-4485"></a>  By default, all the buffers in the desktop are restored at one go. 
However, this may be slow if there are a lot of buffers in the
desktop.  You can specify the maximum number of buffers to restore
immediately with the variable <code>desktop-restore-eager</code>; the
remaining buffers are restored lazily, when Emacs is idle.

   <p><a name="index-desktop_002dclear-4486"></a><a name="index-desktop_002dglobals_002dto_002dclear-4487"></a><a name="index-desktop_002dclear_002dpreserve_002dbuffers_002dregexp-4488"></a>  Type <kbd>M-x desktop-clear</kbd> to empty the Emacs desktop.  This kills
all buffers except for internal ones, and clears the global variables
listed in <code>desktop-globals-to-clear</code>.  If you want this to
preserve certain buffers, customize the variable
<code>desktop-clear-preserve-buffers-regexp</code>, whose value is a regular
expression matching the names of buffers not to kill.

   <p>If you want to save minibuffer history from one session to
another, use the <code>savehist</code> library.

<h2 class="chapter">47 Recursive Editing Levels</h2>

<p><a name="index-recursive-editing-level-4489"></a><a name="index-editing-level_002c-recursive-4490"></a>
  A <dfn>recursive edit</dfn> is a situation in which you are using Emacs
commands to perform arbitrary editing while in the middle of another
Emacs command.  For example, when you type <kbd>C-r</kbd> inside of a
<code>query-replace</code>, you enter a recursive edit in which you can change
the current buffer.  On exiting from the recursive edit, you go back to
the <code>query-replace</code>.  See <a href="#Query-Replace">Query Replace</a>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dM_002dc-4491"></a><a name="index-exit_002drecursive_002dedit-4492"></a><a name="index-exiting-recursive-edit-4493"></a>  <dfn>Exiting</dfn> the recursive edit means returning to the unfinished
command, which continues execution.  The command to exit is <kbd>C-M-c</kbd>
(<code>exit-recursive-edit</code>).

   <p>You can also <dfn>abort</dfn> the recursive edit.  This is like exiting,
but also quits the unfinished command immediately.  Use the command
<kbd>C-]</kbd> (<code>abort-recursive-edit</code>) to do this.  See <a href="#Quitting">Quitting</a>.

   <p>The mode line shows you when you are in a recursive edit by displaying
square brackets around the parentheses that always surround the major and
minor mode names.  Every window's mode line shows this in the same way,
since being in a recursive edit is true of Emacs as a whole rather than
any particular window or buffer.

   <p>It is possible to be in recursive edits within recursive edits.  For
example, after typing <kbd>C-r</kbd> in a <code>query-replace</code>, you may type a
command that enters the debugger.  This begins a recursive editing level
for the debugger, within the recursive editing level for <kbd>C-r</kbd>. 
Mode lines display a pair of square brackets for each recursive editing
level currently in progress.

   <p>Exiting the inner recursive edit (such as with the debugger <kbd>c</kbd>
command) resumes the command running in the next level up.  When that
command finishes, you can then use <kbd>C-M-c</kbd> to exit another recursive
editing level, and so on.  Exiting applies to the innermost level only. 
Aborting also gets out of only one level of recursive edit; it returns
immediately to the command level of the previous recursive edit.  If you
wish, you can then abort the next recursive editing level.

   <p>Alternatively, the command <kbd>M-x top-level</kbd> aborts all levels of
recursive edits, returning immediately to the top-level command
reader.  It also exits the minibuffer, if it is active.

   <p>The text being edited inside the recursive edit need not be the same text
that you were editing at top level.  It depends on what the recursive edit
is for.  If the command that invokes the recursive edit selects a different
buffer first, that is the buffer you will edit recursively.  In any case,
you can switch buffers within the recursive edit in the normal manner (as
long as the buffer-switching keys have not been rebound).  You could
probably do all the rest of your editing inside the recursive edit,
visiting files and all.  But this could have surprising effects (such as
stack overflow) from time to time.  So remember to exit or abort the
recursive edit when you no longer need it.

   <p>In general, we try to minimize the use of recursive editing levels in
GNU Emacs.  This is because they constrain you to go back in a
particular order&mdash;from the innermost level toward the top level.  When
possible, we present different activities in separate buffers so that
you can switch between them as you please.  Some commands switch to a
new major mode which provides a command to switch back.  These
approaches give you more flexibility to go back to unfinished tasks in
the order you choose.

</dl>

   <p>The Browse-URL package allows you to easily follow URLs from within
Emacs.  Most URLs are followed by invoking a web browser;
`<samp><span class="samp">mailto:</span></samp>' URLs are followed by invoking the <code>compose-mail</code>
Emacs command to send mail to the specified address (see <a href="#Sending-Mail">Sending Mail</a>).

   <p>The command <kbd>M-x browse-url</kbd> prompts for a URL, and follows it. 
If point is located near a plausible URL, that URL is offered as the
default.  The Browse-URL package also provides other commands which
you might like to bind to keys, such as <code>browse-url-at-point</code> and
<code>browse-url-at-mouse</code>.

   <p><a name="index-browse_002durl_002dmailto_002dfunction-4501"></a><a name="index-browse_002durl_002dbrowser_002dfunction-4502"></a>  You can customize Browse-URL's behavior via various options in the
<code>browse-url</code> Customize group.  In particular, the option
<code>browse-url-mailto-function</code> lets you define how to follow
`<samp><span class="samp">mailto:</span></samp>' URLs, while <code>browse-url-browser-function</code> lets you
define how to follow other types of URLs.  For more information, view
the package commentary by typing <kbd>C-h P browse-url &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.

typing <kbd>M-x goto-address-mode</kbd>.  When this buffer-local minor mode
is enabled, it finds all the URLs in the buffer, highlights them, and
turns them into clickable buttons.  You can follow the URL by typing
<kbd>C-c &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> (<code>goto-address-at-point</code>) while point is on
its text; or by clicking with <kbd>mouse-2</kbd>, or by clicking
<kbd>mouse-1</kbd> quickly (see <a href="#Mouse-References">Mouse References</a>).  Following a URL is
done by calling <code>browse-url</code> as a subroutine
(see <a href="#Browse_002dURL">Browse-URL</a>).

   <p>It can be useful to add <code>goto-address-mode</code> to mode hooks and
hooks for displaying an incoming message
(e.g., <code>rmail-show-message-hook</code> for Rmail, and
<code>mh-show-mode-hook</code> for MH-E).  This is not needed for Gnus,
which has a similar feature of its own.

  The FFAP package replaces certain key bindings for finding files,
such as <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>, with commands that provide more sensitive
defaults.  These commands behave like the ordinary ones when given a
prefix argument.  Otherwise, they get the default file name or URL
from the text around point.  If what is found in the buffer has the
form of a URL rather than a file name, the commands use
<code>browse-url</code> to view it (see <a href="#Browse_002dURL">Browse-URL</a>).

   <p>This feature is useful for following references in mail or news
buffers, <samp><span class="file">README</span></samp> files, <samp><span class="file">MANIFEST</span></samp> files, and so on.  For
more information, view the package commentary by typing <kbd>C-h P

<a name="index-animate_002dbirthday_002dpresent-4526"></a><a name="index-animate-4527"></a>  The <code>animate</code> package makes text dance (e.g., <kbd>M-x

<code>blackbox</code> challenges you to determine the location of objects
inside a box by tomography.  <code>mpuz</code> displays a multiplication
puzzle with letters standing for digits in a code that you must
guess&mdash;to guess a value, type a letter and then the digit you think it
stands for.  The aim of <code>5x5</code> is to fill in all the squares.

   <p><a name="index-bubbles-4532"></a>  <kbd>M-x bubbles</kbd> is a game in which the object is to remove as many
bubbles as you can in the smallest number of moves.

   <p><a name="index-decipher-4533"></a><a name="index-ciphers-4534"></a><a name="index-cryptanalysis-4535"></a>  <kbd>M-x decipher</kbd> helps you to cryptanalyze a buffer which is
encrypted in a simple monoalphabetic substitution cipher.

   <p><a name="index-dissociated_002dpress-4536"></a>  <kbd>M-x dissociated-press</kbd> scrambles the text in the current Emacs
buffer, word by word or character by character, writing its output to
a buffer named <samp><span class="file">*Dissociation*</span></samp>.  A positive argument tells it to
operate character by character, and specifies the number of overlap
characters.  A negative argument tells it to operate word by word, and
specifies the number of overlap words.  Dissociated Press produces
results fairly like those of a Markov chain, but is however, an
independent, ignoriginal invention; it techniquitously copies several
consecutive characters from the sample text between random jumps,
unlike a Markov chain which would jump randomly after each word or
character.  Keep dissociwords out of your documentation, if you want
it to be well userenced and properbose.

   <p><a name="index-dunnet-4537"></a>  <kbd>M-x dunnet</kbd> runs a text-based adventure game.

<h2 class="chapter">50 Emacs Lisp Packages</h2>

<p><a name="index-Package-4562"></a><a name="index-Emacs-Lisp-package-archive-4563"></a><a name="index-Package-archive-4564"></a><a name="index-Emacs-Lisp-package-4565"></a>
Emacs includes a facility that lets you easily download and install
<dfn>packages</dfn> that implement additional features.  Each package is a
separate Emacs Lisp program, sometimes including other components such
as an Info manual.

   <p><kbd>M-x list-packages</kbd> brings up a buffer named <samp><span class="file">*Packages*</span></samp>
with a list of all packages.  You can install or uninstall packages
via this buffer.  See <a href="#Package-Menu">Package Menu</a>.

   <p><a name="index-describe_002dpackage-4566"></a>  The command <kbd>C-h P</kbd> (<code>describe-package</code>) prompts for the
name of a package, and displays a help buffer describing the
attributes of the package and the features that it implements.

   <p>By default, Emacs downloads packages from a <dfn>package archive</dfn>
maintained by the Emacs developers and hosted by the GNU project. 
Optionally, you can also download packages from archives maintained by
third parties.  See <a href="#Package-Installation">Package Installation</a>.

   <p>For information about turning an Emacs Lisp program into an
installable package, See <a href="elisp.html#Packaging">Packaging</a>.

<h3 class="section">50.1 The Package Menu Buffer</h3>

<p><a name="index-package-menu-4567"></a><a name="index-built_002din-package-4568"></a><a name="index-list_002dpackages-4569"></a>
The command <kbd>M-x list-packages</kbd> brings up the <dfn>package menu</dfn>. 
This is a buffer listing all the packages that Emacs knows about, one
on each line, with the following information:

     <ul>
<li>The package name (e.g., `<samp><span class="samp">auctex</span></samp>').

     <li>The package's version number (e.g., `<samp><span class="samp">11.86</span></samp>').

     <li>The package's status&mdash;normally one of `<samp><span class="samp">available</span></samp>' (can be
downloaded from the package archive), `<samp><span class="samp">installed</span></samp>',
<!-- @samp{unsigned} (installed, but not signed; @pxref{Package Signing}), -->
or `<samp><span class="samp">built-in</span></samp>' (included in Emacs by default).  The status
`<samp><span class="samp">external</span></samp>' means the package is not built-in and not from the
directory specified by <code>package-user-dir</code> (see <a href="#Package-Files">Package Files</a>).  External packages are treated much like built-in: they
cannot be deleted through the package menu, and are not considered for
upgrading.

     <p>The status can also be `<samp><span class="samp">new</span></samp>'.  This is equivalent to
`<samp><span class="samp">available</span></samp>', except that it means the package became newly
available on the package archive after your last invocation of
<kbd>M-x list-packages</kbd>.  In other instances, a package may have the
status `<samp><span class="samp">held</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">disabled</span></samp>', or `<samp><span class="samp">obsolete</span></samp>'. 
See <a href="#Package-Installation">Package Installation</a>.

     <li>A short description of the package. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">The <code>list-packages</code> command accesses the network, to retrieve the
list of available packages from the package archive server.  If the
network is unavailable, it falls back on the most recently retrieved
list.

   <p>The following commands are available in the package menu:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>h</kbd><dd>Print a short message summarizing how to use the package menu
(<code>package-menu-quick-help</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>?</kbd><dt><kbd>&lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Display a help buffer for the package on the current line
(<code>package-menu-describe-package</code>), similar to the help window
displayed by the <kbd>C-h P</kbd> command (see <a href="#Packages">Packages</a>).

     <br><dt><kbd>i</kbd><dd>Mark the package on the current line for installation
(<code>package-menu-mark-install</code>).  If the package status is
`<samp><span class="samp">available</span></samp>', this adds an `<samp><span class="samp">I</span></samp>' character to the start of the
line; typing <kbd>x</kbd> (see below) will download and install the
package.

     <br><dt><kbd>d</kbd><dd>Mark the package on the current line for deletion
(<code>package-menu-mark-delete</code>).  If the package status is
`<samp><span class="samp">installed</span></samp>', this adds a `<samp><span class="samp">D</span></samp>' character to the start of the
line; typing <kbd>x</kbd> (see below) will delete the package. 
See <a href="#Package-Files">Package Files</a>, for information about what package deletion
entails.

     <br><dt><kbd>~</kbd><dd>Mark all obsolete packages for deletion
(<code>package-menu-mark-obsolete-for-deletion</code>).  This marks for
deletion all the packages whose status is `<samp><span class="samp">obsolete</span></samp>'.

     <br><dt><kbd>u</kbd><dt><kbd>&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd><dd>Remove any installation or deletion mark previously added to the
current line by an <kbd>i</kbd> or <kbd>d</kbd> command.

     <br><dt><kbd>U</kbd><dd>Mark all package with a newer available version for upgrading
(<code>package-menu-mark-upgrades</code>).  This places an installation mark
on the new available versions, and a deletion mark on the old
installed versions.

     <br><dt><kbd>x</kbd><dd><a name="index-package_002dmenu_002dasync-4570"></a>Download and install all packages marked with <kbd>i</kbd>, and their
dependencies; also, delete all packages marked with <kbd>d</kbd>
(<code>package-menu-execute</code>).  This also removes the marks.

     <br><dt><kbd>r</kbd><dd>Refresh the package list (<code>package-menu-refresh</code>).  This fetches
the list of available packages from the package archive again, and
recomputes the package list.

     <br><dt><kbd>f</kbd><dd>Filter the package list (<code>package-menu-filter</code>).  This prompts
for a keyword (e.g., `<samp><span class="samp">games</span></samp>'), then shows only the packages
that relate to that keyword.  To restore the full package list,
type <kbd>q</kbd>.

     <br><dt><kbd>H</kbd><dd>Permanently hide packages that match a regexp
(<code>package-menu-hide-package</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>(</kbd><dd>Toggle visibility of old versions of packages and also of versions
from lower-priority archives (<code>package-menu-toggle-hiding</code>). 
</dl>

<p class="noindent">For example, you can install a package by typing <kbd>i</kbd> on the line
listing that package, followed by <kbd>x</kbd>.

<h3 class="section">50.2 Package Installation</h3>

<p><a name="index-package_002dinstall-4571"></a>  Packages are most conveniently installed using the package menu
(see <a href="#Package-Menu">Package Menu</a>), but you can also use the command <kbd>M-x
package-install</kbd>.  This prompts for the name of a package with the
`<samp><span class="samp">available</span></samp>' status, then downloads and installs it.

   <p><a name="index-package-requirements-4572"></a>  A package may <dfn>require</dfn> certain other packages to be installed,
because it relies on functionality provided by them.  When Emacs
installs such a package, it also automatically downloads and installs
any required package that is not already installed.  (If a required
package is somehow unavailable, Emacs signals an error and stops
installation.)  A package's requirements list is shown in its help
buffer.

   <p><a name="index-package_002darchives-4573"></a>  By default, packages are downloaded from a single package archive
maintained by the Emacs developers.  This is controlled by the
variable <code>package-archives</code>, whose value is a list of package
archives known to Emacs.  Each list element must have the form
<code>(</code><var>id</var><code> . </code><var>location</var><code>)</code>, where <var>id</var> is the name of a
package archive and <var>location</var> is the <acronym>HTTP</acronym> address or
directory name of the package archive.  You can alter this list if you
wish to use third party package archives&mdash;but do so at your own risk,
and use only third parties that you think you can trust!

   <p><a name="Package-Signing"></a>
<a name="index-package-security-4574"></a><a name="index-package-signing-4575"></a>  The maintainers of package archives can increase the trust that you
can have in their packages by <dfn>signing</dfn> them.  They generate a
private/public pair of cryptographic keys, and use the private key to
create a <dfn>signature file</dfn> for each package.  With the public key, you
can use the signature files to verify who created the package, and
that it has not been modified.  A valid signature is not a cast-iron
guarantee that a package is not malicious, so you should still
exercise caution.  Package archives should provide instructions
on how you can obtain their public key.  One way is to download the
key from a server such as <a href="http://pgp.mit.edu/">http://pgp.mit.edu/</a>. 
Use <kbd>M-x package-import-keyring</kbd> to import the key into Emacs. 
Emacs stores package keys in the <samp><span class="file">gnupg</span></samp> subdirectory
of <code>package-user-dir</code>. 
The public key for the GNU package archive is distributed with Emacs,
in the <samp><span class="file">etc/package-keyring.gpg</span></samp>.  Emacs uses it automatically.

   <p><a name="index-package_002dcheck_002dsignature-4576"></a><a name="index-package_002dunsigned_002darchives-4577"></a>  If the user option <code>package-check-signature</code> is non-<code>nil</code>,
Emacs attempts to verify signatures when you install packages.  If the
option has the value <code>allow-unsigned</code>, you can still install a
package that is not signed.  If you use some archives that do not sign
their packages, you can add them to the list <code>package-unsigned-archives</code>.

   <p>For more information on cryptographic keys and signing,
see <a href="gnupg.html#Top">Top</a>. 
Emacs comes with an interface to GNU Privacy Guard,
see <a href="epa.html#Top">EasyPG</a>.

   <p><a name="index-package_002dpinned_002dpackages-4578"></a>  If you have more than one package archive enabled, and some of them
offer different versions of the same package, you may find the option
<code>package-pinned-packages</code> useful.  You can add package/archive
pairs to this list, to ensure that the specified package is only ever
downloaded from the specified archive.

   <p><a name="index-package_002darchive_002dpriorities-4579"></a><a name="index-package_002dmenu_002dhide_002dlow_002dpriority-4580"></a>  Another option that is useful when you have several package archives
enabled is <code>package-archive-priorities</code>.  It specifies the
priority of each archive (higher numbers specify higher priority
archives).  By default, archives have the priority of zero, unless
specified otherwise by this option's value.  Packages from
lower-priority archives will not be shown in the menu, if the same
package is available from a higher-priority archive.  (This is
controlled by the value of <code>package-menu-hide-low-priority</code>.)

   <p>Once a package is downloaded and installed, it is <dfn>loaded</dfn> into
the current Emacs session.  Loading a package is not quite the same as
loading a Lisp library (see <a href="#Lisp-Libraries">Lisp Libraries</a>); its effect varies
from package to package.  Most packages just make some new commands
available, while others have more wide-ranging effects on the Emacs
session.  For such information, consult the package's help buffer.

   <p>By default, Emacs also automatically loads all installed packages in
subsequent Emacs sessions.  This happens at startup, after processing
the init file (see <a href="#Init-File">Init File</a>).  As an exception, Emacs does not
load packages at startup if invoked with the `<samp><span class="samp">-q</span></samp>' or
`<samp><span class="samp">--no-init-file</span></samp>' options (see <a href="#Initial-Options">Initial Options</a>).

   <p><a name="index-package_002denable_002dat_002dstartup-4581"></a>  To disable automatic package loading, change the variable
<code>package-enable-at-startup</code> to <code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-package_002dinitialize-4582"></a>  The reason automatic package loading occurs after loading the init
file is that user options only receive their customized values after
loading the init file, including user options which affect the
packaging system.  In some circumstances, you may want to load
packages explicitly in your init file (usually because some other code
in your init file depends on a package).  In that case, your init file
should call the function <code>package-initialize</code>.  It is up to you
to ensure that relevant user options, such as <code>package-load-list</code>
(see below), are set up prior to the <code>package-initialize</code> call. 
This will automatically set <code>package-enable-at-startup</code> to <code>nil</code>, to
avoid loading the packages again after processing the init file. 
Alternatively, you may choose to completely inhibit package loading at
startup, and invoke the command <kbd>M-x package-initialize</kbd> to load
your packages manually.

   <p><a name="index-package_002dload_002dlist-4583"></a>  For finer control over package loading, you can use the variable
<code>package-load-list</code>.  Its value should be a list.  A list element
of the form <code>(</code><var>name</var> <var>version</var><code>)</code> tells Emacs to load
version <var>version</var> of the package named <var>name</var>.  Here,
<var>version</var> should be a version string (corresponding to a specific
version of the package), or <code>t</code> (which means to load any
installed version), or <code>nil</code> (which means no version; this
disables the package, preventing it from being loaded).  A list
element can also be the symbol <code>all</code>, which means to load the
latest installed version of any package not named by the other list
elements.  The default value is just <code>'(all)</code>.

   <p>For example, if you set <code>package-load-list</code> to <code>'((muse
"3.20") all)</code>, then Emacs only loads version 3.20 of the `<samp><span class="samp">muse</span></samp>'
package, plus any installed version of packages other than
`<samp><span class="samp">muse</span></samp>'.  Any other version of `<samp><span class="samp">muse</span></samp>' that happens to be
installed will be ignored.  The `<samp><span class="samp">muse</span></samp>' package will be listed in
the package menu with the `<samp><span class="samp">held</span></samp>' status.

<h3 class="section">50.3 Package Files and Directory Layout</h3>

<p><a name="index-package-directory-4584"></a>
<a name="index-package-file-4585"></a><a name="index-package_002dinstall_002dfile-4586"></a>  Each package is downloaded from the package archive in the form of a
single <dfn>package file</dfn>&mdash;either an Emacs Lisp source file, or a tar
file containing multiple Emacs Lisp source and other files.  Package
files are automatically retrieved, processed, and disposed of by the
Emacs commands that install packages.  Normally, you will not need to
deal directly with them, unless you are making a package
(see <a href="elisp.html#Packaging">Packaging</a>).  Should
you ever need to install a package directly from a package file, use
the command <kbd>M-x package-install-file</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-package_002duser_002ddir-4587"></a>  Once installed, the contents of a package are placed in a
subdirectory of <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs.d/elpa/</span></samp> (you can change the name of
that directory by changing the variable <code>package-user-dir</code>).  The
package subdirectory is named <samp><var>name</var><span class="file">-</span><var>version</var></samp>, where
<var>name</var> is the package name and <var>version</var> is its version
string.

   <p><a name="index-system_002dwide-packages-4588"></a><a name="index-package_002ddirectory_002dlist-4589"></a>  In addition to <code>package-user-dir</code>, Emacs looks for installed
packages in the directories listed in <code>package-directory-list</code>. 
These directories are meant for system administrators to make Emacs
packages available system-wide; Emacs itself never installs packages
there.  The package subdirectories for <code>package-directory-list</code>
are laid out in the same way as in <code>package-user-dir</code>.

   <p>Deleting a package (see <a href="#Package-Menu">Package Menu</a>) involves deleting the
corresponding package subdirectory.  This only works for packages
installed in <code>package-user-dir</code>; if told to act on a package in a
system-wide package directory, the deletion command signals an error.

variables documented in this manual are listed in <a href="#Variable-Index">Variable Index</a>.  A separate class of settings are the <dfn>faces</dfn>, which
determine the fonts, colors, and other attributes of text
(see <a href="#Faces">Faces</a>).

   <p><a name="index-customize-4594"></a><a name="index-customization-buffer-4595"></a>  To browse and alter settings (both variables and faces), type
<kbd>M-x customize</kbd>.  This creates a <dfn>customization buffer</dfn>, which
lets you navigate through a logically organized list of settings, edit
and set their values, and save them permanently.

<h4 class="subsection">51.1.1 Customization Groups</h4>

<p><a name="index-customization-groups-4596"></a>
  Customization settings are organized into <dfn>customization
groups</dfn>.  These groups are collected into bigger groups, all the way
up to a master group called <code>Emacs</code>.

   <p><kbd>M-x customize</kbd> creates a customization buffer that shows the
top-level <code>Emacs</code> group.  It looks like this, in part:

<!-- we want the buffer example to all be on one page, but unfortunately -->
<!-- that's quite a bit of text, so force all space to the bottom. -->
<!-- @page -->

   <p class="noindent">The main part of this buffer shows the `<samp><span class="samp">Emacs</span></samp>' customization
group, which contains several other groups (`<samp><span class="samp">Editing</span></samp>',
`<samp><span class="samp">Convenience</span></samp>', etc.).  The contents of those groups are not
listed here, only one line of documentation each.

   <p>The <dfn>state</dfn> of the group indicates whether setting in that group
has been edited, set or saved.  See <a href="#Changing-a-Variable">Changing a Variable</a>.

<dfn>editable fields</dfn> that you can edit.  For example, at the top of
the customization buffer is an editable field for searching for
settings (see <a href="#Browsing-Custom">Browsing Custom</a>).  There are also <dfn>buttons</dfn> and
<dfn>links</dfn>, which you can activate by either clicking with the mouse,
or moving point there and typing &lt;RET&gt;.  For example, the group
names like `<samp><span class="samp">[Editing]</span></samp>' are links; activating one of these links
brings up the customization buffer for that group.

(<code>widget-forward</code>) to move forward to the next button or editable
field.  <kbd>S-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> (<code>widget-backward</code>) moves back to the
previous button or editable field.

<h4 class="subsection">51.1.2 Browsing and Searching for Settings</h4>

<p><a name="index-customize_002dbrowse-4604"></a>
  From the top-level customization buffer created by <kbd>M-x
customize</kbd>, you can follow the links to the subgroups of the
`<samp><span class="samp">Emacs</span></samp>' customization group.  These subgroups may contain
settings for you to customize; they may also contain further subgroups,
dealing with yet more specialized subsystems of Emacs.  As you
navigate the hierarchy of customization groups, you should find some
settings that you want to customize.

   <p>If you are interested in customizing a particular setting or
customization group, you can go straight there with the commands
<kbd>M-x customize-option</kbd>, <kbd>M-x customize-face</kbd>, or <kbd>M-x
customize-group</kbd>.  See <a href="#Specific-Customization">Specific Customization</a>.

   <p><a name="index-custom_002dsearch_002dfield-4605"></a>  If you don't know exactly what groups or settings you want to
customize, you can search for them using the editable search field at
the top of each customization buffer.  Here, you can type in a search
term&mdash;either one or more words separated by spaces, or a regular
expression (see <a href="#Regexps">Regexps</a>).  Then type &lt;RET&gt; in the field, or
activate the `<samp><span class="samp">Search</span></samp>' button next to it, to switch to a
customization buffer containing groups and settings that match those
terms.  Note, however, that this feature only finds groups and
settings that are loaded in the current Emacs session.

   <p>If you don't want customization buffers to show the search field,
change the variable <code>custom-search-field</code> to <code>nil</code>.

   <p>The command <kbd>M-x customize-apropos</kbd> is similar to using the
search field, except that it reads the search term(s) using the
minibuffer.  See <a href="#Specific-Customization">Specific Customization</a>.

   <p><kbd>M-x customize-browse</kbd> is another way to browse the available
settings.  This command creates a special customization buffer which
shows only the names of groups and settings, in a structured layout. 
You can show the contents of a group, in the same buffer, by invoking
the `<samp><span class="samp">[+]</span></samp>' button next to the group name.  When the group contents
are shown, the button changes to `<samp><span class="samp">[-]</span></samp>'; invoking that hides the
group contents again.  Each group or setting in this buffer has a link
which says `<samp><span class="samp">[Group]</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">[Option]</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">[Face]</span></samp>'.  Invoking
this link creates an ordinary customization buffer showing just that
group, option, or face; this is the way to change settings that you
find with <kbd>M-x customize-browse</kbd>.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">51.1.3 Changing a Variable</h4>

<p>Here is an example of what a variable, or user option, looks like in
the customization buffer:

<pre class="smallexample">     [Hide] Kill Ring Max: 60
        [State]: STANDARD.
        Maximum length of kill ring before oldest elements are thrown away.
</pre>
   <p>The first line shows that the variable is named
<code>kill-ring-max</code>, formatted as `<samp><span class="samp">Kill Ring Max</span></samp>' for easier
viewing.  Its value is `<samp><span class="samp">60</span></samp>'.  The button labeled `<samp><span class="samp">[Hide]</span></samp>',
if activated, hides the variable's value and state; this is useful to
avoid cluttering up the customization buffer with very long values
(for this reason, variables that have very long values may start out
hidden).  If you use the `<samp><span class="samp">[Hide]</span></samp>' button, it changes to
`<samp><span class="samp">[Show Value]</span></samp>', which you can activate to reveal the value and
state.  On a graphical display, the `<samp><span class="samp">[Hide]</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">[Show
Value]</span></samp>' buttons are replaced with graphical triangles pointing
downwards and rightwards respectively.

   <p>The line after the variable name indicates the <dfn>customization
state</dfn> of the variable: in this example, `<samp><span class="samp">STANDARD</span></samp>' means you
have not changed the variable, so its value is the default one.  The
`<samp><span class="samp">[State]</span></samp>' button gives a menu of operations for customizing the
variable.

   <p>Below the customization state is the documentation for the variable. 
This is the same documentation that would be shown by the <kbd>C-h v</kbd>
command (see <a href="#Examining">Examining</a>).  If the documentation is more than one
line long, only one line may be shown.  If so, that line ends with a
`<samp><span class="samp">[More]</span></samp>' button; activate this to see the full documentation.

   <p><a name="index-user-options_002c-changing-4606"></a><a name="index-customizing-variables-4607"></a><a name="index-variables_002c-changing-4608"></a>  To enter a new value for `<samp><span class="samp">Kill Ring Max</span></samp>', just move point to
the value and edit it.  For example, type <kbd>M-d</kbd> to delete the
`<samp><span class="samp">60</span></samp>' and type in another number.  As you begin to alter the text,
the `<samp><span class="samp">[State]</span></samp>' line will change:

<pre class="smallexample">     [State]: EDITED, shown value does not take effect until you
              set or save it.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Editing the value does not make it take effect right away.  To do
that, you must <dfn>set</dfn> the variable by activating the `<samp><span class="samp">[State]</span></samp>'
button and choosing `<samp><span class="samp">Set for Current Session</span></samp>'.  Then the
variable's state becomes:

<pre class="smallexample">     [State]: SET for current session only.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You don't have to worry about specifying a value that is not valid;
the `<samp><span class="samp">Set for Current Session</span></samp>' operation checks for validity and
will not install an unacceptable value.

   <p><a name="index-M_002dTAB-_0040r_007b_0028customization-buffer_0029_007d-4609"></a><a name="index-C_002dM_002di-_0040r_007b_0028customization-buffer_0029_007d-4610"></a><a name="index-widget_002dcomplete-4611"></a>  While editing certain kinds of values, such as file names, directory
names, and Emacs command names, you can perform completion with
<kbd>C-M-i</kbd> (<code>widget-complete</code>), or the equivalent keys
<kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> or <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; &lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>.  This behaves much
like minibuffer completion (see <a href="#Completion">Completion</a>).

   <p>Typing &lt;RET&gt; on an editable value field moves point forward to
the next field or button, like &lt;TAB&gt;.  You can thus type &lt;RET&gt;
when you are finished editing a field, to move on to the next button
or field.  To insert a newline within an editable field, use <kbd>C-o</kbd>
or <kbd>C-q C-j</kbd>.

   <p>For some variables, there is only a fixed set of legitimate values,
and you are not allowed to edit the value directly.  Instead, a
`<samp><span class="samp">[Value Menu]</span></samp>' button appears before the value; activating this
button presents a choice of values.  For a boolean &ldquo;on or off&rdquo;
value, the button says `<samp><span class="samp">[Toggle]</span></samp>', and flips the value.  After
using the `<samp><span class="samp">[Value Menu]</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">[Toggle]</span></samp>' button, you must
again set the variable to make the chosen value take effect.

   <p>Some variables have values with complex structure.  For example, the
value of <code>minibuffer-frame-alist</code> is an association list.  Here
is how it appears in the customization buffer:

<pre class="smallexample">     [Hide] Minibuffer Frame Alist:
     [INS] [DEL] Parameter: width
                 Value: 80
     [INS] [DEL] Parameter: height
                 Value: 2
     [INS]
        [ State ]: STANDARD.
        Alist of parameters for the initial minibuffer frame. [Hide]
        <span class="roman">[...more lines of documentation...]</span>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this case, each association in the list consists of two items, one
labeled `<samp><span class="samp">Parameter</span></samp>' and one labeled `<samp><span class="samp">Value</span></samp>'; both are
editable fields.  You can delete an association from the list with the
`<samp><span class="samp">[DEL]</span></samp>' button next to it.  To add an association, use the
`<samp><span class="samp">[INS]</span></samp>' button at the position where you want to insert it; the
very last `<samp><span class="samp">[INS]</span></samp>' button inserts at the end of the list.

   <p><a name="index-saving-a-setting-4612"></a><a name="index-settings_002c-how-to-save-4613"></a>  When you set a variable, the new value takes effect only in the
current Emacs session.  To <dfn>save</dfn> the value for future sessions,
use the `<samp><span class="samp">[State]</span></samp>' button and select the `<samp><span class="samp">Save for Future
Sessions</span></samp>' operation.  See <a href="#Saving-Customizations">Saving Customizations</a>.

   <p>You can also restore the variable to its standard value by using the
`<samp><span class="samp">[State]</span></samp>' button and selecting the `<samp><span class="samp">Erase Customization</span></samp>'
operation.  There are actually four reset operations:

     <dl>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">Undo Edits</span></samp>'<dd>If you have modified but not yet set the variable, this restores the
text in the customization buffer to match the actual value.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">Reset to Saved</span></samp>'<dd>This restores the value of the variable to the last saved value,
and updates the text accordingly.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">Erase Customization</span></samp>'<dd>This sets the variable to its standard value.  Any saved value that
you have is also eliminated.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">Set to Backup Value</span></samp>'<dd>This sets the variable to a previous value that was set in the
customization buffer in this session.  If you customize a variable
and then reset it, which discards the customized value,
you can get the discarded value back again with this operation. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-comments-on-customized-settings-4614"></a>  Sometimes it is useful to record a comment about a specific
customization.  Use the `<samp><span class="samp">Add Comment</span></samp>' item from the
`<samp><span class="samp">[State]</span></samp>' menu to create a field for entering the comment.

   <p>Near the top of the customization buffer are two lines of buttons:

<pre class="smallexample">      [Set for Current Session] [Save for Future Sessions]
      [Undo Edits] [Reset to Saved] [Erase Customization]   [Exit]
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Each of the first five buttons performs the stated operation&mdash;set,
save, reset, etc.&mdash;on all the settings in the buffer that could
meaningfully be affected.  They do not operate on settings that are
hidden, nor on subgroups that are hidden or not visible in the buffer.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dc-_0040r_007b_0028customization-buffer_0029_007d-4615"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dc-_0040r_007b_0028customization-buffer_0029_007d-4616"></a><a name="index-Custom_002dset-4617"></a><a name="index-Custom_002dsave-4618"></a>  The command <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> (<code>Custom-set</code>) is equivalent to using
the `<samp><span class="samp">[Set for Current Session]</span></samp>' button.  The command <kbd>C-x
C-s</kbd> (<code>Custom-save</code>) is like using the `<samp><span class="samp">[Save for Future
Sessions]</span></samp>' button.

   <p><a name="index-custom_002dbuffer_002ddone_002dkill-4619"></a>  The `<samp><span class="samp">[Exit]</span></samp>' button switches out of the customization buffer,
and buries the buffer at the bottom of the buffer list.  To make it
kill the customization buffer instead, change the variable
<code>custom-buffer-done-kill</code> to <code>t</code>.

<h4 class="subsection">51.1.4 Saving Customizations</h4>

<p>In the customization buffer, you can <dfn>save</dfn> a customization
setting by choosing the `<samp><span class="samp">Save for Future Sessions</span></samp>' choice from
its `<samp><span class="samp">[State]</span></samp>' button.  The <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd> (<code>Custom-save</code>)
command, or the `<samp><span class="samp">[Save for Future Sessions]</span></samp>' button at the top of
the customization buffer, saves all applicable settings in the buffer.

   <p>Saving works by writing code to a file, usually your initialization
file (see <a href="#Init-File">Init File</a>).  Future Emacs sessions automatically read
this file at startup, which sets up the customizations again.

   <p><a name="index-custom_002dfile-4620"></a>  You can choose to save customizations somewhere other than your
initialization file.  To make this work, you must add a couple of
lines of code to your initialization file, to set the variable
<code>custom-file</code> to the name of the desired file, and to load that
file.  For example:

<pre class="example">     (setq custom-file "~/.emacs-custom.el")
     (load custom-file)
</pre>
   <p>You can even specify different customization files for different
Emacs versions, like this:

<pre class="example">     (cond ((&lt; emacs-major-version 22)
            ;; <span class="roman">Emacs 21 customization.</span>
            (setq custom-file "~/.custom-21.el"))
           ((and (= emacs-major-version 22)
                 (&lt; emacs-minor-version 3))
            ;; <span class="roman">Emacs 22 customization, before version 22.3.</span>
            (setq custom-file "~/.custom-22.el"))
           (t
            ;; <span class="roman">Emacs version 22.3 or later.</span>
            (setq custom-file "~/.emacs-custom.el")))
     
     (load custom-file)
</pre>
   <p>If Emacs was invoked with the <samp><span class="option">-q</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">--no-init-file</span></samp>
options (see <a href="#Initial-Options">Initial Options</a>), it will not let you save your
customizations in your initialization file.  This is because saving
customizations from such a session would wipe out all the other
customizations you might have on your initialization file.

   <p><a name="index-unsaved-customizations_002c-reminder-to-save-4621"></a><a name="index-custom_002dprompt_002dcustomize_002dunsaved_002doptions-4622"></a>  Please note that any customizations you have not chosen to save for
future sessions will be lost when you terminate Emacs.  If you'd like
to be prompted about unsaved customizations at termination time, add
the following to your initialization file:

<pre class="example">     (add-hook 'kill-emacs-query-functions
               'custom-prompt-customize-unsaved-options)

<p><a name="index-customizing-faces-4623"></a><a name="index-faces_002c-customizing-4624"></a><a name="index-fonts-and-faces-4625"></a>
  You can customize faces (see <a href="#Faces">Faces</a>), which determine how Emacs
displays different types of text.  Customization groups can contain
both variables and faces.

   <p>For example, in programming language modes, source code comments are
shown with <code>font-lock-comment-face</code> (see <a href="#Font-Lock">Font Lock</a>).  In a
customization buffer, that face appears like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     [Hide] Font Lock Comment Face:[sample]
        [State] : STANDARD.
        Font Lock mode face used to highlight comments.
        [ ] Font Family: --
        [ ] Font Foundry: --
        [ ] Width: --
        [ ] Height: --
        [ ] Weight: --
        [ ] Slant: --
        [ ] Underline: --
        [ ] Overline: --
        [ ] Strike-through: --
        [ ] Box around text: --
        [ ] Inverse-video: --
        [X] Foreground: Firebrick     [Choose]  (sample)
        [ ] Background: --
        [ ] Stipple: --
        [ ] Inherit: --
        [Hide Unused Attributes]
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The first three lines show the name, `<samp><span class="samp">[State]</span></samp>' button, and
documentation for the face.  Below that is a list of <dfn>face
attributes</dfn>.  In front of each attribute is a checkbox.  A filled
checkbox, `<samp><span class="samp">[X]</span></samp>', means that the face specifies a value for this
attribute; an empty checkbox, `<samp><span class="samp">[ ]</span></samp>', means that the face does not
specify any special value for the attribute.  You can activate a
checkbox to specify or unspecify its attribute.

   <p>A face does not have to specify every single attribute; in fact,
most faces only specify a few attributes.  In the above example,
<code>font-lock-comment-face</code> only specifies the foreground color. 
Any unspecified attribute is taken from the special face named
<code>default</code>, whose attributes are all specified.  The
<code>default</code> face is the face used to display any text that does not
have an explicitly-assigned face; furthermore, its background color
attribute serves as the background color of the frame.

   <p>The `<samp><span class="samp">Hide Unused Attributes</span></samp>' button, at the end of the
attribute list, hides the unspecified attributes of the face.  When
attributes are being hidden, the button changes to `<samp><span class="samp">[Show All
Attributes]</span></samp>', which reveals the entire attribute list.  The
customization buffer may start out with unspecified attributes hidden,
to avoid cluttering the interface.

   <p>When an attribute is specified, you can change its value in the
usual ways.

   <p>Foreground and background colors can be specified using either color
names or RGB triplets (see <a href="#Colors">Colors</a>).  You can also use the
`<samp><span class="samp">[Choose]</span></samp>' button to switch to a list of color names; select a
color with &lt;RET&gt; in that buffer to put the color name in the value
field.

   <p>Setting, saving and resetting a face work like the same operations for
variables (see <a href="#Changing-a-Variable">Changing a Variable</a>).

   <p>A face can specify different appearances for different types of
displays.  For example, a face can make text red on a color display,
but use a bold font on a monochrome display.  To specify multiple
appearances for a face, select `<samp><span class="samp">For All Kinds of Displays</span></samp>' in the
menu you get from invoking `<samp><span class="samp">[State]</span></samp>'.

   <p><a name="index-customize_002doption-4626"></a>  If you want to customize a particular user option, type <kbd>M-x
customize-option</kbd>.  This reads the variable name, and sets up the
customization buffer with just that one user option.  When entering
the variable name into the minibuffer, completion is available, but
only for the names of variables that have been loaded into Emacs.

   <p><a name="index-customize_002dface-4627"></a><a name="index-customize_002dgroup-4628"></a>  Likewise, you can customize a specific face using <kbd>M-x
customize-face</kbd>.  You can set up a customization buffer for a specific
customization group using <kbd>M-x customize-group</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-customize_002dapropos-4629"></a>  <kbd>M-x customize-apropos</kbd> prompts for a search term&mdash;either one
or more words separated by spaces, or a regular expression&mdash;and sets
up a customization buffer for all <em>loaded</em> settings and groups
with matching names.  This is like using the search field at the top
of the customization buffer (see <a href="#Customization-Groups">Customization Groups</a>).

   <p><a name="index-customize_002dchanged-4630"></a>  When you upgrade to a new Emacs version, you might want to consider
customizing new settings, and settings whose meanings or default
values have changed.  To do this, use <kbd>M-x customize-changed</kbd> and
specify a previous Emacs version number using the minibuffer.  It
creates a customization buffer which shows all the settings and groups
whose definitions have been changed since the specified version,
loading them if necessary.

   <p><a name="index-customize_002dsaved-4631"></a><a name="index-customize_002dunsaved-4632"></a>  If you change settings and then decide the change was a mistake, you
can use two commands to revisit your changes.  Use <kbd>M-x

<h4 class="subsection">51.1.7 Custom Themes</h4>

<p><a name="index-custom-themes-4633"></a>
  <dfn>Custom themes</dfn> are collections of settings that can be enabled
or disabled as a unit.  You can use Custom themes to switch easily
between various collections of settings, and to transfer such
collections from one computer to another.

   <p>A Custom theme is stored as an Emacs Lisp source file.  If the name of
the Custom theme is <var>name</var>, the theme file is named
<samp><var>name</var><span class="file">-theme.el</span></samp>.  See <a href="#Creating-Custom-Themes">Creating Custom Themes</a>, for the
format of a theme file and how to make one.

   <p><a name="index-customize_002dthemes-4634"></a><a name="index-custom_002dtheme_002ddirectory-4635"></a><a name="index-color-scheme-4636"></a>  Type <kbd>M-x customize-themes</kbd> to switch to a buffer named
<samp><span class="file">*Custom Themes*</span></samp>, which lists the Custom themes that Emacs knows
about.  By default, Emacs looks for theme files in two locations: the
directory specified by the variable <code>custom-theme-directory</code>
(which defaults to <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs.d/</span></samp>), and a directory named
<samp><span class="file">etc/themes</span></samp> in your Emacs installation (see the variable
<code>data-directory</code>).  The latter contains several Custom themes
which are distributed with Emacs, which customize Emacs's faces to fit
various color schemes.  (Note, however, that Custom themes need not be
restricted to this purpose; they can be used to customize variables
too.)

   <p><a name="index-custom_002dtheme_002dload_002dpath-4637"></a>  If you want Emacs to look for Custom themes in some other directory,
add the directory name to the list variable
<code>custom-theme-load-path</code>.  Its default value is
<code>(custom-theme-directory t)</code>; here, the symbol
<code>custom-theme-directory</code> has the special meaning of the value of
the variable <code>custom-theme-directory</code>, while <code>t</code> stands for
the built-in theme directory <samp><span class="file">etc/themes</span></samp>.  The themes listed in
the <samp><span class="file">*Custom Themes*</span></samp> buffer are those found in the directories
specified by <code>custom-theme-load-path</code>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002ds-_0040r_007b_0028Custom-Themes-buffer_0029_007d-4638"></a>  In the <samp><span class="file">*Custom Themes*</span></samp> buffer, you can activate the checkbox
next to a Custom theme to enable or disable the theme for the current
Emacs session.  When a Custom theme is enabled, all of its settings
(variables and faces) take effect in the Emacs session.  To apply the
choice of theme(s) to future Emacs sessions, type <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd>
(<code>custom-theme-save</code>) or use the `<samp><span class="samp">[Save Theme Settings]</span></samp>'
button.

   <p><a name="index-custom_002dsafe_002dthemes-4639"></a>  When you first enable a Custom theme, Emacs displays the contents of
the theme file and asks if you really want to load it.  Because
loading a Custom theme can execute arbitrary Lisp code, you should
only say yes if you know that the theme is safe; in that case, Emacs
offers to remember in the future that the theme is safe (this is done
by saving the theme file's SHA-256 hash to the variable
<code>custom-safe-themes</code>; if you want to treat all themes as safe,
change its value to <code>t</code>).  Themes that come with Emacs (in the
<samp><span class="file">etc/themes</span></samp> directory) are exempt from this check, and are
always considered safe.

   <p><a name="index-custom_002denabled_002dthemes-4640"></a>  Setting or saving Custom themes actually works by customizing the
variable <code>custom-enabled-themes</code>.  The value of this variable is
a list of Custom theme names (as Lisp symbols, e.g., <code>tango</code>). 
Instead of using the <samp><span class="file">*Custom Themes*</span></samp> buffer to set
<code>custom-enabled-themes</code>, you can customize the variable using the
usual customization interface, e.g., with <kbd>M-x customize-option</kbd>. 
Note that Custom themes are not allowed to set
<code>custom-enabled-themes</code> themselves.

   <p>Any customizations that you make through the customization buffer
take precedence over theme settings.  This lets you easily override
individual theme settings that you disagree with.  If settings from
two different themes overlap, the theme occurring earlier in
<code>custom-enabled-themes</code> takes precedence.  In the customization
buffer, if a setting has been changed from its default by a Custom
theme, its `<samp><span class="samp">State</span></samp>' display shows `<samp><span class="samp">THEMED</span></samp>' instead of
`<samp><span class="samp">STANDARD</span></samp>'.

   <p><a name="index-load_002dtheme-4641"></a><a name="index-enable_002dtheme-4642"></a><a name="index-disable_002dtheme-4643"></a>  You can enable a specific Custom theme in the current Emacs session
by typing <kbd>M-x load-theme</kbd>.  This prompts for a theme name, loads
the theme from the theme file, and enables it.  If a theme file
has been loaded before, you can enable the theme without loading its
file by typing <kbd>M-x enable-theme</kbd>.  To disable a Custom theme,
type <kbd>M-x disable-theme</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-describe_002dtheme-4644"></a>  To see a description of a Custom theme, type <kbd>?</kbd> on its line in
the <samp><span class="file">*Custom Themes*</span></samp> buffer; or type <kbd>M-x describe-theme</kbd>
anywhere in Emacs and enter the theme name.

<h4 class="subsection">51.1.8 Creating Custom Themes</h4>

<p><a name="index-custom-themes_002c-creating-4645"></a>
<a name="index-customize_002dcreate_002dtheme-4646"></a>  You can define a Custom theme using an interface similar to the
customization buffer, by typing <kbd>M-x customize-create-theme</kbd>. 
This switches to a buffer named <samp><span class="file">*Custom Theme*</span></samp>.  It also offers
to insert some common Emacs faces into the theme (a convenience, since
Custom themes are often used to customize faces).  If you answer no,
the theme will initially contain no settings.

   <p>Near the top of the <samp><span class="file">*Custom Theme*</span></samp> buffer are editable fields
where you can enter the theme's name and description.  The name can be
anything except `<samp><span class="samp">user</span></samp>'.  The description is the one that will be
shown when you invoke <kbd>M-x describe-theme</kbd> for the theme.  Its
first line should be a brief one-sentence summary; in the buffer made
by <kbd>M-x customize-themes</kbd>, this sentence is displayed next to the
theme name.

   <p>To add a new setting to the theme, use the `<samp><span class="samp">[Insert Additional
Face]</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">[Insert Additional Variable]</span></samp>' buttons.  Each button
reads a face or variable name using the minibuffer, with completion,
and inserts a customization entry for the face or variable.  You can
edit the variable values or face attributes in the same way as in a
normal customization buffer.  To remove a face or variable from the
theme, uncheck the checkbox next to its name.

   <p><a name="index-custom_002dtheme_002ddirectory-4647"></a>  After specifying the Custom theme's faces and variables, type
<kbd>C-x C-s</kbd> (<code>custom-theme-write</code>) or use the buffer's
`<samp><span class="samp">[Save Theme]</span></samp>' button.  This saves the theme file, named
<samp><var>name</var><span class="file">-theme.el</span></samp> where <var>name</var> is the theme name, in the
directory named by <code>custom-theme-directory</code>.

   <p>From the <samp><span class="file">*Custom Theme*</span></samp> buffer, you can view and edit an
existing Custom theme by activating the `<samp><span class="samp">[Visit Theme]</span></samp>' button
and specifying the theme name.  You can also add the settings of
another theme into the buffer, using the `<samp><span class="samp">[Merge Theme]</span></samp>' button. 
You can import your non-theme settings into a Custom theme by using
the `<samp><span class="samp">[Merge Theme]</span></samp>' button and specifying the special theme named
`<samp><span class="samp">user</span></samp>'.

   <p>A theme file is simply an Emacs Lisp source file, and loading the
Custom theme works by loading the Lisp file.  Therefore, you can edit
a theme file directly instead of using the <samp><span class="file">*Custom Theme*</span></samp>
buffer.  See <a href="elisp.html#Custom-Themes">Custom Themes</a>, for details.

<h3 class="section">51.2 Variables</h3>

<p><a name="index-variable-4648"></a>
  A <dfn>variable</dfn> is a Lisp symbol which has a value.  The symbol's
name is also called the <dfn>variable name</dfn>.  A variable name can
contain any characters that can appear in a file, but most variable
names consist of ordinary words separated by hyphens.

   <p>The name of the variable serves as a compact description of its
role.  Most variables also have a <dfn>documentation string</dfn>, which
describes what the variable's purpose is, what kind of value it should
have, and how the value will be used.  You can view this documentation
using the help command <kbd>C-h v</kbd> (<code>describe-variable</code>). 
See <a href="#Examining">Examining</a>.

   <p>Emacs uses many Lisp variables for internal record keeping, but the
most interesting variables for a non-programmer user are those meant
for users to change&mdash;these are called <dfn>customizable variables</dfn> or
<dfn>user options</dfn> (see <a href="#Easy-Customization">Easy Customization</a>).  In the following
sections, we will describe other aspects of Emacs variables, such as
how to set them outside Customize.

   <p>Emacs Lisp allows any variable (with a few exceptions) to have any
kind of value.  However, many variables are meaningful only if
assigned values of a certain type.  For example, only numbers are
meaningful values for <code>kill-ring-max</code>, which specifies the
maximum length of the kill ring (see <a href="#Earlier-Kills">Earlier Kills</a>); if you give
<code>kill-ring-max</code> a string value, commands such as <kbd>C-y</kbd>
(<code>yank</code>) will signal an error.  On the other hand, some variables
don't care about type; for instance, if a variable has one effect for
<code>nil</code> values and another effect for non-<code>nil</code> values,
then any value that is not the symbol <code>nil</code> induces the second
effect, regardless of its type (by convention, we usually use the
value <code>t</code>&mdash;a symbol which stands for &ldquo;true&rdquo;&mdash;to specify a
non-<code>nil</code> value).  If you set a variable using the customization
buffer, you need not worry about giving it an invalid type: the
customization buffer usually only allows you to enter meaningful
values.  When in doubt, use <kbd>C-h v</kbd> (<code>describe-variable</code>) to
check the variable's documentation string to see kind of value it
expects (see <a href="#Examining">Examining</a>).

   <p>To examine the value of a variable, use <kbd>C-h v</kbd>
(<code>describe-variable</code>).  This reads a variable name using the
minibuffer, with completion, and displays both the value and the
documentation of the variable.  For example,

<pre class="example">     C-h v fill-column &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">displays something like this:

<pre class="example">     fill-column is a variable defined in ‘C source code’.
     Its value is 70
     
       Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.
       This variable is safe as a file local variable if its value
       satisfies the predicate ‘integerp’.
     
     Documentation:
     Column beyond which automatic line-wrapping should happen.
     Interactively, you can set the buffer local value using C-x f.
     
     You can customize this variable.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The line that says `<samp><span class="samp">You can customize the variable</span></samp>' indicates that
this variable is a user option.  <kbd>C-h v</kbd> is not restricted to user
options; it allows non-customizable variables too.

   <p><a name="index-set_002dvariable-4650"></a>  The most convenient way to set a specific customizable variable is
with <kbd>M-x set-variable</kbd>.  This reads the variable name with the
minibuffer (with completion), and then reads a Lisp expression for the
new value using the minibuffer a second time (you can insert the old
value into the minibuffer for editing via <kbd>M-n</kbd>).  For example,

<pre class="example">     M-x set-variable &lt;RET&gt; fill-column &lt;RET&gt; 75 &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">sets <code>fill-column</code> to 75.

   <p><kbd>M-x set-variable</kbd> is limited to customizable variables, but you
can set any variable with a Lisp expression like this:

<pre class="example">     (setq fill-column 75)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">To execute such an expression, type <kbd>M-:</kbd> (<code>eval-expression</code>)
and enter the expression in the minibuffer (see <a href="#Lisp-Eval">Lisp Eval</a>). 
Alternatively, go to the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer, type in the
expression, and then type <kbd>C-j</kbd> (see <a href="#Lisp-Interaction">Lisp Interaction</a>).

   <p>Setting variables, like all means of customizing Emacs except where
otherwise stated, affects only the current Emacs session.  The only
way to alter the variable in future sessions is to put something in
your initialization file (see <a href="#Init-File">Init File</a>).

<h4 class="subsection">51.2.2 Hooks</h4>

<p><a name="index-hook-4651"></a><a name="index-running-a-hook-4652"></a>
  <dfn>Hooks</dfn> are an important mechanism for customizing Emacs.  A
hook is a Lisp variable which holds a list of functions, to be called
on some well-defined occasion.  (This is called <dfn>running the
hook</dfn>.)  The individual functions in the list are called the <dfn>hook
functions</dfn> of the hook.  For example, the hook <code>kill-emacs-hook</code>
runs just before exiting Emacs (see <a href="#Exiting">Exiting</a>).

   <p><a name="index-normal-hook-4653"></a>  Most hooks are <dfn>normal hooks</dfn>.  This means that when Emacs runs
the hook, it calls each hook function in turn, with no arguments.  We
have made an effort to keep most hooks normal, so that you can use
them in a uniform way.  Every variable whose name ends in `<samp><span class="samp">-hook</span></samp>'
is a normal hook.

   <p><a name="index-abnormal-hook-4654"></a>  A few hooks are <dfn>abnormal hooks</dfn>.  Their names end in
`<samp><span class="samp">-functions</span></samp>', instead of `<samp><span class="samp">-hook</span></samp>' (some old code may also use
the deprecated suffix `<samp><span class="samp">-hooks</span></samp>').  What
makes these hooks abnormal is the way its functions are
called&mdash;perhaps they are given arguments, or perhaps the values they
return are used in some way.  For example,
<code>find-file-not-found-functions</code> is abnormal because as soon as
one hook function returns a non-<code>nil</code> value, the rest are not
called at all (see <a href="#Visiting">Visiting</a>).  The documentation of each abnormal
hook variable explains how its functions are used.

   <p><a name="index-add_002dhook-4655"></a>  You can set a hook variable with <code>setq</code> like any other Lisp
variable, but the recommended way to add a function to a hook (either
normal or abnormal) is to use <code>add-hook</code>, as shown by the
following examples.  See <a href="elisp.html#Hooks">Hooks</a>, for details.

   <p>Most major modes run one or more <dfn>mode hooks</dfn> as the last step
of initialization.  Mode hooks are a convenient way to customize the
behavior of individual modes; they are always normal.  For example,
here's how to set up a hook to turn on Auto Fill mode in Text mode and
other modes based on Text mode:

<pre class="example">     (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'auto-fill-mode)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This works by calling <code>auto-fill-mode</code>, which enables the minor
mode when no argument is supplied (see <a href="#Minor-Modes">Minor Modes</a>).  Next,
suppose you don't want Auto Fill mode turned on in LaTeX mode,
which is one of the modes based on Text mode.  You can do this with
the following additional line:

<pre class="example">     (add-hook 'latex-mode-hook (lambda () (auto-fill-mode -1)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here we have used the special macro <code>lambda</code> to construct an
anonymous function (see <a href="elisp.html#Lambda-Expressions">Lambda Expressions</a>), which calls <code>auto-fill-mode</code> with an argument
of <code>-1</code> to disable the minor mode.  Because LaTeX mode runs
<code>latex-mode-hook</code> after running <code>text-mode-hook</code>, the result
leaves Auto Fill mode disabled.

   <p>Here is a more complex example, showing how to use a hook to
customize the indentation of C code:

<pre class="example">     (setq my-c-style
       '((c-comment-only-line-offset . 4)
         (c-cleanup-list . (scope-operator
                            empty-defun-braces
                            defun-close-semi))))
     
     (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook
       (lambda () (c-add-style "my-style" my-c-style t)))
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-Prog-mode-4656"></a><a name="index-program-editing-4657"></a>  Major mode hooks also apply to other major modes <dfn>derived</dfn> from
the original mode (see <a href="elisp.html#Derived-Modes">Derived Modes</a>).  For instance, HTML mode is derived from Text mode
(see <a href="#HTML-Mode">HTML Mode</a>); when HTML mode is enabled, it runs
<code>text-mode-hook</code> before running <code>html-mode-hook</code>.  This
provides a convenient way to use a single hook to affect several
related modes.  In particular, if you want to apply a hook function to
any programming language mode, add it to <code>prog-mode-hook</code>; Prog
mode is a major mode that does little else than to let other major
modes inherit from it, exactly for this purpose.

   <p>It is best to design your hook functions so that the order in which
they are executed does not matter.  Any dependence on the order is
asking for trouble.  However, the order is predictable: the hook
functions are executed in the order they appear in the hook.

   <p><a name="index-remove_002dhook-4658"></a>  If you play with adding various different versions of a hook
function by calling <code>add-hook</code> over and over, remember that all
the versions you added will remain in the hook variable together.  You
can clear out individual functions by calling <code>remove-hook</code>, or
do <code>(setq </code><var>hook-variable</var><code> nil)</code> to remove everything.

   <p><a name="index-buffer_002dlocal-hooks-4659"></a>  If the hook variable is buffer-local, the buffer-local variable will
be used instead of the global variable.  However, if the buffer-local
variable contains the element <code>t</code>, the global hook variable will
be run as well.

   <p><a name="index-local-variables-4660"></a>  Almost any variable can be made <dfn>local</dfn> to a specific Emacs
buffer.  This means that its value in that buffer is independent of its
value in other buffers.  A few variables are always local in every
buffer.  Every other Emacs variable has a <dfn>global</dfn> value which is in
effect in all buffers that have not made the variable local.

   <p><a name="index-make_002dlocal_002dvariable-4661"></a>  <kbd>M-x make-local-variable</kbd> reads the name of a variable and makes
it local to the current buffer.  Changing its value subsequently in
this buffer will not affect others, and changes in its global value
will not affect this buffer.

   <p><a name="index-make_002dvariable_002dbuffer_002dlocal-4662"></a><a name="index-per_002dbuffer-variables-4663"></a>  <kbd>M-x make-variable-buffer-local</kbd> marks a variable so it will
become local automatically whenever it is set.  More precisely, once a
variable has been marked in this way, the usual ways of setting the
variable automatically do <code>make-local-variable</code> first.  We call
such variables <dfn>per-buffer</dfn> variables.  Many variables in Emacs
are normally per-buffer; the variable's document string tells you when
this is so.  A per-buffer variable's global value is normally never
effective in any buffer, but it still has a meaning: it is the initial
value of the variable for each new buffer.

   <p>Major modes (see <a href="#Major-Modes">Major Modes</a>) always make variables local to the
buffer before setting the variables.  This is why changing major modes
in one buffer has no effect on other buffers.  Minor modes also work
by setting variables&mdash;normally, each minor mode has one controlling
variable which is non-<code>nil</code> when the mode is enabled
(see <a href="#Minor-Modes">Minor Modes</a>).  For many minor modes, the controlling variable
is per buffer, and thus always buffer-local.  Otherwise, you can make
it local in a specific buffer like any other variable.

   <p>A few variables cannot be local to a buffer because they are always
local to each display instead (see <a href="#Multiple-Displays">Multiple Displays</a>).  If you try to
make one of these variables buffer-local, you'll get an error message.

   <p><a name="index-kill_002dlocal_002dvariable-4664"></a>  <kbd>M-x kill-local-variable</kbd> makes a specified variable cease to be
local to the current buffer.  The global value of the variable
henceforth is in effect in this buffer.  Setting the major mode kills
all the local variables of the buffer except for a few variables
specially marked as <dfn>permanent locals</dfn>.

   <p><a name="index-setq_002ddefault-4665"></a>  To set the global value of a variable, regardless of whether the
variable has a local value in the current buffer, you can use the Lisp
construct <code>setq-default</code>.  This construct is used just like
<code>setq</code>, but it sets variables' global values instead of their local
values (if any).  When the current buffer does have a local value, the
new global value may not be visible until you switch to another buffer. 
Here is an example:

<pre class="example">     (setq-default fill-column 75)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><code>setq-default</code> is the only way to set the global value of a variable
that has been marked with <code>make-variable-buffer-local</code>.

   <p><a name="index-default_002dvalue-4666"></a>  Lisp programs can use <code>default-value</code> to look at a variable's
default value.  This function takes a symbol as argument and returns its
default value.  The argument is evaluated; usually you must quote it
explicitly.  For example, here's how to obtain the default value of
<code>fill-column</code>:

<pre class="example">     (default-value 'fill-column)

  A file can specify local variable values to use when editing the
file with Emacs.  Visiting the file checks for local variable
specifications; it automatically makes these variables local to the
buffer, and sets them to the values specified in the file.

</div>

<h5 class="subsubsection">51.2.4.1 Specifying File Variables</h5>

<p>There are two ways to specify file local variable values: in the first
line, or with a local variables list.  Here's how to specify them in the
first line:

<pre class="example">     -*- mode: <var>modename</var>; <var>var</var>: <var>value</var>; ... -*-
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You can specify any number of variable/value pairs in this way, each
pair with a colon and semicolon.  The special variable/value pair
<code>mode: </code><var>modename</var><code>;</code>, if present, specifies a major mode.  The
<var>value</var>s are used literally, and not evaluated.

   <p><a name="index-add_002dfile_002dlocal_002dvariable_002dprop_002dline-4669"></a><a name="index-delete_002dfile_002dlocal_002dvariable_002dprop_002dline-4670"></a><a name="index-copy_002ddir_002dlocals_002dto_002dfile_002dlocals_002dprop_002dline-4671"></a>  You can use <kbd>M-x add-file-local-variable-prop-line</kbd> instead of
adding entries by hand.  This command prompts for a variable and
value, and adds them to the first line in the appropriate way. 
<kbd>M-x delete-file-local-variable-prop-line</kbd> prompts for a variable,
and deletes its entry from the line.  The command <kbd>M-x
copy-dir-locals-to-file-locals-prop-line</kbd> copies the current
directory-local variables to the first line (see <a href="#Directory-Variables">Directory Variables</a>).

   <p>Here is an example first line that specifies Lisp mode and sets two
variables with numeric values:

<pre class="smallexample">     ;; -*- mode: Lisp; fill-column: 75; comment-column: 50; -*-
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Aside from <code>mode</code>, other keywords that have special meanings as
file variables are <code>coding</code>, <code>unibyte</code>, and <code>eval</code>. 
These are described below.

   <p><a name="index-shell-scripts_002c-and-local-file-variables-4672"></a><a name="index-man-pages_002c-and-local-file-variables-4673"></a>  In shell scripts, the first line is used to identify the script
interpreter, so you cannot put any local variables there.  To
accommodate this, Emacs looks for local variable specifications in the
<em>second</em> line if the first line specifies an interpreter.  The
same is true for man pages which start with the magic string
`<samp><span class="samp">'\"</span></samp>' to specify a list of troff preprocessors (not all do,
however).

   <p>Apart from using a `<samp><span class="samp">-*-</span></samp>' line, you can define file local
variables using a <dfn>local variables list</dfn> near the end of the file. 
The start of the local variables list should be no more than 3000
characters from the end of the file, and must be on the last page if
the file is divided into pages.

   <p>If a file has both a local variables list and a `<samp><span class="samp">-*-</span></samp>' line,
Emacs processes <em>everything</em> in the `<samp><span class="samp">-*-</span></samp>' line first, and
<em>everything</em> in the local variables list afterward.  The exception
to this is a major mode specification.  Emacs applies this first,
wherever it appears, since most major modes kill all local variables as
part of their initialization.

   <p>A local variables list starts with a line containing the string
`<samp><span class="samp">Local Variables:</span></samp>', and ends with a line containing the string
`<samp><span class="samp">End:</span></samp>'.  In between come the variable names and values, one set
per line, like this:

<pre class="example">     /* Local Variables:  */
     /* mode: c           */
     /* comment-column: 0 */
     /* End:              */
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this example, each line starts with the prefix `<samp><span class="samp">/*</span></samp>' and ends
with the suffix `<samp><span class="samp">*/</span></samp>'.  Emacs recognizes the prefix and suffix by
finding them surrounding the magic string `<samp><span class="samp">Local Variables:</span></samp>', on
the first line of the list; it then automatically discards them from
the other lines of the list.  The usual reason for using a prefix
and/or suffix is to embed the local variables list in a comment, so it
won't confuse other programs that the file is intended for.  The
example above is for the C programming language, where comments start
with `<samp><span class="samp">/*</span></samp>' and end with `<samp><span class="samp">*/</span></samp>'.

   <p>If some unrelated text might look to Emacs as a local variables list,
you can countermand that by inserting a form-feed character (a page
delimiter, see <a href="#Pages">Pages</a>) after that text.  Emacs only looks for
file-local variables in the last page of a file, after the last page
delimiter.

   <p><a name="index-add_002dfile_002dlocal_002dvariable-4674"></a><a name="index-delete_002dfile_002dlocal_002dvariable-4675"></a><a name="index-copy_002ddir_002dlocals_002dto_002dfile_002dlocals-4676"></a>  Instead of typing in the local variables list directly, you can use
the command <kbd>M-x add-file-local-variable</kbd>.  This prompts for a
variable and value, and adds them to the list, adding the `<samp><span class="samp">Local
Variables:</span></samp>' string and start and end markers as necessary.  The
command <kbd>M-x delete-file-local-variable</kbd> deletes a variable from
the list.  <kbd>M-x copy-dir-locals-to-file-locals</kbd> copies
directory-local variables to the list (see <a href="#Directory-Variables">Directory Variables</a>).

   <p>As with the `<samp><span class="samp">-*-</span></samp>' line, the variables in a local variables list
are used literally, and are not evaluated first.  If you want to split
a long string value across multiple lines of the file, you can use
backslash-newline, which is ignored in Lisp string constants; you
should put the prefix and suffix on each line, even lines that start
or end within the string, as they will be stripped off when processing
the list.  Here is an example:

<pre class="example">     # Local Variables:
     # compile-command: "cc foo.c -Dfoo=bar -Dhack=whatever \
     #   -Dmumble=blaah"
     # End:
</pre>
   <p>Some names have special meanings in a local variables
list:

     <ul>
<li><code>mode</code> enables the specified major mode.

     <li><code>eval</code> evaluates the specified Lisp expression (the value
returned by that expression is ignored).

     <li><code>coding</code> specifies the coding system for character code
conversion of this file.  See <a href="#Coding-Systems">Coding Systems</a>.

     <li><code>unibyte</code> says to load or compile a file of Emacs Lisp in unibyte
mode, if the value is <code>t</code>.  See <a href="elisp.html#Disabling-Multibyte">Disabling Multibyte Characters</a>.

   </ul>

<p class="noindent">These four keywords are not really variables; setting them in any
other context has no special meaning.

   <p>Do not use the <code>mode</code> keyword for minor modes.  To enable or
disable a minor mode in a local variables list, use the <code>eval</code>
keyword with a Lisp expression that runs the mode command
(see <a href="#Minor-Modes">Minor Modes</a>).  For example, the following local variables
list enables Eldoc mode (see <a href="#Lisp-Doc">Lisp Doc</a>) by calling
<code>eldoc-mode</code> with no argument (calling it with an argument of 1
would do the same), and disables Font Lock mode (see <a href="#Font-Lock">Font Lock</a>) by
calling <code>font-lock-mode</code> with an argument of -1.

<pre class="example">     ;; Local Variables:
     ;; eval: (eldoc-mode)
     ;; eval: (font-lock-mode -1)
     ;; End:
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Note, however, that it is often a mistake to specify minor modes this
way.  Minor modes represent individual user preferences, and it may be
inappropriate to impose your preferences on another user who might
edit the file.  If you wish to automatically enable or disable a minor
mode in a situation-dependent way, it is often better to do it in a
major mode hook (see <a href="#Hooks">Hooks</a>).

   <p>Use the command <kbd>M-x normal-mode</kbd> to reset the local variables
and major mode of a buffer according to the file name and contents,
including the local variables list if any.  See <a href="#Choosing-Modes">Choosing Modes</a>.

<h5 class="subsubsection">51.2.4.2 Safety of File Variables</h5>

<p>File-local variables can be dangerous; when you visit someone else's
file, there's no telling what its local variables list could do to
your Emacs.  Improper values of the <code>eval</code> &ldquo;variable&rdquo;, and
other variables such as <code>load-path</code>, could execute Lisp code you
didn't intend to run.

   <p>Therefore, whenever Emacs encounters file local variable values that
are not known to be safe, it displays the file's entire local
variables list, and asks you for confirmation before setting them. 
You can type <kbd>y</kbd> or &lt;SPC&gt; to put the local variables list into
effect, or <kbd>n</kbd> to ignore it.  When Emacs is run in batch mode
(see <a href="#Initial-Options">Initial Options</a>), it can't really ask you, so it assumes the
answer <kbd>n</kbd>.

   <p>Emacs normally recognizes certain variable/value pairs as safe. 
For instance, it is safe to give <code>comment-column</code> or
<code>fill-column</code> any integer value.  If a file specifies only
known-safe variable/value pairs, Emacs does not ask for confirmation
before setting them.  Otherwise, you can tell Emacs to record all the
variable/value pairs in this file as safe, by typing <kbd>!</kbd> at the
confirmation prompt.  When Emacs encounters these variable/value pairs
subsequently, in the same file or others, it will assume they are
safe.

   <p><a name="index-safe_002dlocal_002dvariable_002dvalues-4677"></a><a name="index-risky-variable-4678"></a>  Some variables, such as <code>load-path</code>, are considered
particularly <dfn>risky</dfn>: there is seldom any reason to specify them
as local variables, and changing them can be dangerous.  If a file
contains only risky local variables, Emacs neither offers nor accepts
<kbd>!</kbd> as input at the confirmation prompt.  If some of the local
variables in a file are risky, and some are only potentially unsafe, you
can enter <kbd>!</kbd> at the prompt.  It applies all the variables, but only
marks the non-risky ones as safe for the future.  If you really want to
record safe values for risky variables, do it directly by customizing
`<samp><span class="samp">safe-local-variable-values</span></samp>' (see <a href="#Easy-Customization">Easy Customization</a>).

   <p><a name="index-enable_002dlocal_002dvariables-4679"></a>  The variable <code>enable-local-variables</code> allows you to change the
way Emacs processes local variables.  Its default value is <code>t</code>,
which specifies the behavior described above.  If it is <code>nil</code>,
Emacs simply ignores all file local variables.  <code>:safe</code> means use
only the safe values and ignore the rest.  Any other value says to
query you about each file that has local variables, without trying to
determine whether the values are known to be safe.

   <p><a name="index-enable_002dlocal_002deval-4680"></a><a name="index-safe_002dlocal_002deval_002dforms-4681"></a>  The variable <code>enable-local-eval</code> controls whether Emacs
processes <code>eval</code> variables.  The three possibilities for the
variable's value are <code>t</code>, <code>nil</code>, and anything else, just as
for <code>enable-local-variables</code>.  The default is <code>maybe</code>, which
is neither <code>t</code> nor <code>nil</code>, so normally Emacs does ask for
confirmation about processing <code>eval</code> variables.

   <p>As an exception, Emacs never asks for confirmation to evaluate any
<code>eval</code> form if that form occurs within the variable
<code>safe-local-eval-forms</code>.

<h4 class="subsection">51.2.5 Per-Directory Local Variables</h4>

<p><a name="index-local-variables_002c-for-all-files-in-a-directory-4682"></a><a name="index-directory_002dlocal-variables-4683"></a><a name="index-per_002ddirectory-local-variables-4684"></a>
  Sometimes, you may wish to define the same set of local variables to
all the files in a certain directory and its subdirectories, such as
the directory tree of a large software project.  This can be
accomplished with <dfn>directory-local variables</dfn>.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007b_002edir_002dlocals_002eel_007d-file-4685"></a>  The usual way to define directory-local variables is to put a file
named <samp><span class="file">.dir-locals.el</span></samp><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-20" name="fnd-20"><sup>20</sup></a> in a
directory.  Whenever Emacs visits any file in that directory or any of
its subdirectories, it will apply the directory-local variables
specified in <samp><span class="file">.dir-locals.el</span></samp>, as though they had been defined as
file-local variables for that file (see <a href="#File-Variables">File Variables</a>).  Emacs
searches for <samp><span class="file">.dir-locals.el</span></samp> starting in the directory of the
visited file, and moving up the directory tree.  To avoid slowdown,
this search is skipped for remote files.  If needed, the search can be
extended for remote files by setting the variable
<code>enable-remote-dir-locals</code> to <code>t</code>.

   <p>The <samp><span class="file">.dir-locals.el</span></samp> file should hold a specially-constructed
list, which maps major mode names (symbols) to alists
(see <a href="elisp.html#Association-Lists">Association Lists</a>). 
Each alist entry consists of a variable name and the directory-local
value to assign to that variable, when the specified major mode is
enabled.  Instead of a mode name, you can specify `<samp><span class="samp">nil</span></samp>', which
means that the alist applies to any mode; or you can specify a
subdirectory name (a string), in which case the alist applies to all
files in that subdirectory.

   <p>Here's an example of a <samp><span class="file">.dir-locals.el</span></samp> file:

<pre class="example">     ((nil . ((indent-tabs-mode . t)
              (fill-column . 80)))
      (c-mode . ((c-file-style . "BSD")
                 (subdirs . nil)))
      ("src/imported"
       . ((nil . ((change-log-default-name
                   . "ChangeLog.local"))))))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This sets `<samp><span class="samp">indent-tabs-mode</span></samp>' and <code>fill-column</code> for any file
in the directory tree, and the indentation style for any C source
file.  The special <code>subdirs</code> element is not a variable, but a
special keyword which indicates that the C mode settings are only to
be applied in the current directory, not in any subdirectories. 
Finally, it specifies a different <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> file name for any
file in the <samp><span class="file">src/imported</span></samp> subdirectory.

   <p><a name="index-add_002ddir_002dlocal_002dvariable-4686"></a><a name="index-delete_002ddir_002dlocal_002dvariable-4687"></a><a name="index-copy_002dfile_002dlocals_002dto_002ddir_002dlocals-4688"></a>  Instead of editing the <samp><span class="file">.dir-locals.el</span></samp> file by hand, you can
use the command <kbd>M-x add-dir-local-variable</kbd>.  This prompts for a
mode or subdirectory name, and for variable and value, and adds the
entry defining the directory-local variable.  <kbd>M-x
delete-dir-local-variable</kbd> deletes an entry.  <kbd>M-x
copy-file-locals-to-dir-locals</kbd> copies the file-local variables in the
current file into <samp><span class="file">.dir-locals.el</span></samp>.

   <p><a name="index-dir_002dlocals_002dset_002dclass_002dvariables-4689"></a><a name="index-dir_002dlocals_002dset_002ddirectory_002dclass-4690"></a>  Another method of specifying directory-local variables is to define
a group of variables/value pairs in a <dfn>directory class</dfn>, using the
<code>dir-locals-set-class-variables</code> function; then, tell Emacs which
directories correspond to the class by using the
<code>dir-locals-set-directory-class</code> function.  These function calls
normally go in your initialization file (see <a href="#Init-File">Init File</a>).  This
method is useful when you can't put <samp><span class="file">.dir-locals.el</span></samp> in a
directory for some reason.  For example, you could apply settings to
an unwritable directory this way:

<pre class="example">     (dir-locals-set-class-variables 'unwritable-directory
        '((nil . ((some-useful-setting . value)))))
     
     (dir-locals-set-directory-class
        "/usr/include/" 'unwritable-directory)
</pre>
   <p>If a variable has both a directory-local and file-local value
specified, the file-local value takes effect.  Unsafe directory-local
variables are handled in the same way as unsafe file-local variables
(see <a href="#Safe-File-Variables">Safe File Variables</a>).

   <p>Directory-local variables also take effect in certain buffers that
do not visit a file directly but perform work within a directory, such
as Dired buffers (see <a href="#Dired">Dired</a>).

<h4 class="subsection">51.3.1 Keymaps</h4>

<p><a name="index-keymap-4692"></a>
  As described in <a href="#Commands">Commands</a>, each Emacs command is a Lisp
function whose definition provides for interactive use.  Like every
Lisp function, a command has a function name, which usually consists
of lower-case letters and hyphens.

   <p>A <dfn>key sequence</dfn> (<dfn>key</dfn>, for short) is a sequence of
<dfn>input events</dfn> that have a meaning as a unit.  Input events
include characters, function keys and mouse buttons&mdash;all the inputs
that you can send to the computer.  A key sequence gets its meaning
from its <dfn>binding</dfn>, which says what command it runs.

   <p>The bindings between key sequences and command functions are
recorded in data structures called <dfn>keymaps</dfn>.  Emacs has many of
these, each used on particular occasions.

   <p><a name="index-global-keymap-4693"></a>  The <dfn>global</dfn> keymap is the most important keymap because it is
always in effect.  The global keymap defines keys for Fundamental mode
(see <a href="#Major-Modes">Major Modes</a>); most of these definitions are common to most or
all major modes.  Each major or minor mode can have its own keymap
which overrides the global definitions of some keys.

   <p>For example, a self-inserting character such as <kbd>g</kbd> is
self-inserting because the global keymap binds it to the command
<code>self-insert-command</code>.  The standard Emacs editing characters
such as <kbd>C-a</kbd> also get their standard meanings from the global
keymap.  Commands to rebind keys, such as <kbd>M-x global-set-key</kbd>,
work by storing the new binding in the proper place in the global map
(see <a href="#Rebinding">Rebinding</a>).

   <p><a name="index-function-key-4694"></a>  Most modern keyboards have function keys as well as character keys. 
Function keys send input events just as character keys do, and keymaps
can have bindings for them.  Key sequences can mix function keys and
characters.  For example, if your keyboard has a &lt;Home&gt; function
key, Emacs can recognize key sequences like <kbd>C-x &lt;Home&gt;</kbd>.  You
can even mix mouse events with keyboard events, such as
<kbd>S-down-mouse-1</kbd>.

   <p>On text terminals, typing a function key actually sends the computer
a sequence of characters; the precise details of the sequence depends
on the function key and on the terminal type.  (Often the sequence
starts with <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; [</kbd>.)  If Emacs understands your terminal
type properly, it automatically handles such sequences as single input
events.

<h4 class="subsection">51.3.2 Prefix Keymaps</h4>

<p>Internally, Emacs records only single events in each keymap. 
Interpreting a key sequence of multiple events involves a chain of
keymaps: the first keymap gives a definition for the first event,
which is another keymap, which is used to look up the second event in
the sequence, and so on.  Thus, a prefix key such as <kbd>C-x</kbd> or
&lt;ESC&gt; has its own keymap, which holds the definition for the event
that immediately follows that prefix.

   <p>The definition of a prefix key is usually the keymap to use for
looking up the following event.  The definition can also be a Lisp
symbol whose function definition is the following keymap; the effect is
the same, but it provides a command name for the prefix key that can be
used as a description of what the prefix key is for.  Thus, the binding
of <kbd>C-x</kbd> is the symbol <code>Control-X-prefix</code>, whose function
definition is the keymap for <kbd>C-x</kbd> commands.  The definitions of
<kbd>C-c</kbd>, <kbd>C-x</kbd>, <kbd>C-h</kbd> and &lt;ESC&gt; as prefix keys appear in
the global map, so these prefix keys are always available.

   <p>Aside from ordinary prefix keys, there is a fictitious &ldquo;prefix key&rdquo;
which represents the menu bar; see <a href="elisp.html#Menu-Bar">Menu Bar</a>, for special information about menu bar key bindings. 
Mouse button events that invoke pop-up menus are also prefix keys; see
<a href="elisp.html#Menu-Keymaps">Menu Keymaps</a>, for more
details.

   <p>Some prefix keymaps are stored in variables with names:

     <ul>
<li><a name="index-ctl_002dx_002dmap-4695"></a><code>ctl-x-map</code> is the variable name for the map used for characters that
follow <kbd>C-x</kbd>. 
<li><a name="index-help_002dmap-4696"></a><code>help-map</code> is for characters that follow <kbd>C-h</kbd>. 
<li><a name="index-esc_002dmap-4697"></a><code>esc-map</code> is for characters that follow &lt;ESC&gt;.  Thus, all Meta
characters are actually defined by this map. 
<li><a name="index-ctl_002dx_002d4_002dmap-4698"></a><code>ctl-x-4-map</code> is for characters that follow <kbd>C-x 4</kbd>. 
<li><a name="index-mode_002dspecific_002dmap-4699"></a><code>mode-specific-map</code> is for characters that follow <kbd>C-c</kbd>.

<h4 class="subsection">51.3.3 Local Keymaps</h4>

<p><a name="index-local-keymap-4700"></a><a name="index-minor-mode-keymap-4701"></a>  So far, we have explained the ins and outs of the global map.  Major
modes customize Emacs by providing their own key bindings in
<dfn>local keymaps</dfn>.  For example, C mode overrides &lt;TAB&gt; to make
it indent the current line for C code.  Minor modes can also have
local keymaps; whenever a minor mode is in effect, the definitions in
its keymap override both the major mode's local keymap and the global
keymap.  In addition, portions of text in the buffer can specify their
own keymaps, which override all other keymaps.

   <p>A local keymap can redefine a key as a prefix key by defining it as
a prefix keymap.  If the key is also defined globally as a prefix, its
local and global definitions (both keymaps) effectively combine: both
definitions are used to look up the event that follows the prefix key. 
For example, if a local keymap defines <kbd>C-c</kbd> as a prefix keymap,
and that keymap defines <kbd>C-z</kbd> as a command, this provides a local
meaning for <kbd>C-c C-z</kbd>.  This does not affect other sequences that
start with <kbd>C-c</kbd>; if those sequences don't have their own local
bindings, their global bindings remain in effect.

   <p>Another way to think of this is that Emacs handles a multi-event key
sequence by looking in several keymaps, one by one, for a binding of the
whole key sequence.  First it checks the minor mode keymaps for minor
modes that are enabled, then it checks the major mode's keymap, and then
it checks the global keymap.  This is not precisely how key lookup
works, but it's good enough for understanding the results in ordinary
circumstances.

  The way to redefine an Emacs key is to change its entry in a keymap. 
You can change the global keymap, in which case the change is
effective in all major modes (except those that have their own
overriding local bindings for the same key).  Or you can change a
local keymap, which affects all buffers using the same major mode.

   <p>In this section, we describe how to rebind keys for the present
Emacs session.  See <a href="#Init-Rebinding">Init Rebinding</a>, for a description of how to
make key rebindings affect future Emacs sessions.

   <p><a name="index-global_002dset_002dkey-4712"></a><a name="index-local_002dset_002dkey-4713"></a><a name="index-global_002dunset_002dkey-4714"></a><a name="index-local_002dunset_002dkey-4715"></a>
     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-x global-set-key &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>key</var> <var>cmd</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Define <var>key</var> globally to run <var>cmd</var>. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x local-set-key &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>key</var> <var>cmd</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Define <var>key</var> locally (in the major mode now in effect) to run
<var>cmd</var>. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x global-unset-key &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>key</var><dd>Make <var>key</var> undefined in the global map. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x local-unset-key &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>key</var><dd>Make <var>key</var> undefined locally (in the major mode now in effect). 
</dl>

   <p>For example, the following binds <kbd>C-z</kbd> to the <code>shell</code>
command (see <a href="#Interactive-Shell">Interactive Shell</a>), replacing the normal global
definition of <kbd>C-z</kbd>:

<pre class="example">     M-x global-set-key &lt;RET&gt; C-z shell &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The <code>global-set-key</code> command reads the command name after the
key.  After you press the key, a message like this appears so that you
can confirm that you are binding the key you want:

<pre class="example">     Set key C-z to command:
</pre>
   <p>You can redefine function keys and mouse events in the same way; just
type the function key or click the mouse when it's time to specify the
key to rebind.

   <p>You can rebind a key that contains more than one event in the same
way.  Emacs keeps reading the key to rebind until it is a complete key
(that is, not a prefix key).  Thus, if you type <kbd>C-f</kbd> for
<var>key</var>, that's the end; it enters the minibuffer immediately to
read <var>cmd</var>.  But if you type <kbd>C-x</kbd>, since that's a prefix, it
reads another character; if that is <kbd>4</kbd>, another prefix character,
it reads one more character, and so on.  For example,

<pre class="example">     M-x global-set-key &lt;RET&gt; C-x 4 $ spell-other-window &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">redefines <kbd>C-x 4 $</kbd> to run the (fictitious) command
<code>spell-other-window</code>.

   <p>You can remove the global definition of a key with
<code>global-unset-key</code>.  This makes the key <dfn>undefined</dfn>; if you
type it, Emacs will just beep.  Similarly, <code>local-unset-key</code> makes
a key undefined in the current major mode keymap, which makes the global
definition (or lack of one) come back into effect in that major mode.

   <p>If you have redefined (or undefined) a key and you subsequently wish
to retract the change, undefining the key will not do the job&mdash;you need
to redefine the key with its standard definition.  To find the name of
the standard definition of a key, go to a Fundamental mode buffer in a
fresh Emacs and use <kbd>C-h c</kbd>.  The documentation of keys in this
manual also lists their command names.

   <p>If you want to prevent yourself from invoking a command by mistake, it
is better to disable the command than to undefine the key.  A disabled
command is less work to invoke when you really want to.

<h4 class="subsection">51.3.6 Rebinding Keys in Your Init File</h4>

<p><a name="index-rebinding-major-mode-keys-4716"></a><!-- This node is referenced in the tutorial.  When renaming or deleting -->
<!-- it, the tutorial needs to be adjusted.  (TUTORIAL.de) -->

   <p>If you have a set of key bindings that you like to use all the time,
you can specify them in your initialization file by writing Lisp code. 
See <a href="#Init-File">Init File</a>, for a description of the initialization file.

   <p><a name="index-kbd-4717"></a>  There are several ways to write a key binding using Lisp.  The
simplest is to use the <code>kbd</code> function, which converts a textual
representation of a key sequence&mdash;similar to how we have written key
sequences in this manual&mdash;into a form that can be passed as an
argument to <code>global-set-key</code>.  For example, here's how to bind
<kbd>C-z</kbd> to the <code>shell</code> command (see <a href="#Interactive-Shell">Interactive Shell</a>):

<pre class="example">     (global-set-key (kbd "C-z") 'shell)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The single-quote before the command name, <code>shell</code>, marks it as a
constant symbol rather than a variable.  If you omit the quote, Emacs
would try to evaluate <code>shell</code> as a variable.  This probably
causes an error; it certainly isn't what you want.

   <p>Here are some additional examples, including binding function keys
and mouse events:

<pre class="example">     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c y") 'clipboard-yank)
     (global-set-key (kbd "C-M-q") 'query-replace)
     (global-set-key (kbd "&lt;f5&gt;") 'flyspell-mode)
     (global-set-key (kbd "C-&lt;f5&gt;") 'linum-mode)
     (global-set-key (kbd "C-&lt;right&gt;") 'forward-sentence)
     (global-set-key (kbd "&lt;mouse-2&gt;") 'mouse-save-then-kill)
</pre>
   <p>Instead of using <code>kbd</code>, you can use a Lisp string or vector to
specify the key sequence.  Using a string is simpler, but only works
for <acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters and Meta-modified <acronym>ASCII</acronym>
characters.  For example, here's how to bind <kbd>C-x M-l</kbd> to
<code>make-symbolic-link</code> (see <a href="#Misc-File-Ops">Misc File Ops</a>):

<pre class="example">     (global-set-key "\C-x\M-l" 'make-symbolic-link)
</pre>
   <p>To put &lt;TAB&gt;, &lt;RET&gt;, &lt;ESC&gt;, or &lt;DEL&gt; in the string,
use the Emacs Lisp escape sequences `<samp><span class="samp">\t</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">\r</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">\e</span></samp>',
and `<samp><span class="samp">\d</span></samp>' respectively.  Here is an example which binds <kbd>C-x
&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> to <code>indent-rigidly</code> (see <a href="#Indentation">Indentation</a>):

<pre class="example">     (global-set-key "\C-x\t" 'indent-rigidly)
</pre>
   <p>When the key sequence includes function keys or mouse button events,
or non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters such as <code>C-=</code> or <code>H-a</code>,
you can use a vector to specify the key sequence.  Each element in the
vector stands for an input event; the elements are separated by spaces
and surrounded by a pair of square brackets.  If a vector element is a
character, write it as a Lisp character constant: `<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>' followed by
the character as it would appear in a string.  Function keys are
represented by symbols (see <a href="#Function-Keys">Function Keys</a>); simply write the
symbol's name, with no other delimiters or punctuation.  Here are some
examples:

<pre class="example">     (global-set-key [?\C-=] 'make-symbolic-link)
     (global-set-key [?\M-\C-=] 'make-symbolic-link)
     (global-set-key [?\H-a] 'make-symbolic-link)
     (global-set-key [f7] 'make-symbolic-link)
     (global-set-key [C-mouse-1] 'make-symbolic-link)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You can use a vector for the simple cases too:

<pre class="example">     (global-set-key [?\C-z ?\M-l] 'make-symbolic-link)
</pre>
   <p>Language and coding systems may cause problems with key bindings for
non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters.  See <a href="#Init-Non_002dASCII">Init Non-ASCII</a>.

   <p>As described in <a href="#Local-Keymaps">Local Keymaps</a>, major modes and minor modes can
define local keymaps.  These keymaps are constructed when the mode is
used for the first time in a session.  If you wish to change one of
these keymaps, you must use the <dfn>mode hook</dfn> (see <a href="#Hooks">Hooks</a>).

   <p><a name="index-define_002dkey-4718"></a>  For example, Texinfo mode runs the hook <code>texinfo-mode-hook</code>. 
Here's how you can use the hook to add local bindings for <kbd>C-c n</kbd>
and <kbd>C-c p</kbd> in Texinfo mode:

<pre class="example">     (add-hook 'texinfo-mode-hook
               (lambda ()
                 (define-key texinfo-mode-map "\C-cp"
                             'backward-paragraph)
                 (define-key texinfo-mode-map "\C-cn"
                             'forward-paragraph)))

<h4 class="subsection">51.3.7 Modifier Keys</h4>

<p><a name="index-modifier-keys-4719"></a>
  The default key bindings in Emacs are set up so that modified
alphabetical characters are case-insensitive.  In other words,
<kbd>C-A</kbd> does the same thing as <kbd>C-a</kbd>, and <kbd>M-A</kbd> does the
same thing as <kbd>M-a</kbd>.  This concerns only alphabetical characters,
and does not apply to shifted versions of other keys; for
instance, <kbd>C-@</kbd> is not the same as <kbd>C-2</kbd>.

   <p>A &lt;Control&gt;-modified alphabetical character is always considered
case-insensitive: Emacs always treats <kbd>C-A</kbd> as <kbd>C-a</kbd>,
<kbd>C-B</kbd> as <kbd>C-b</kbd>, and so forth.  The reason for this is
historical.

   <p>For all other modifiers, you can make the modified alphabetical
characters case-sensitive when you customize Emacs.  For instance, you
could make <kbd>M-a</kbd> and <kbd>M-A</kbd> run different commands.

   <p>Although only the &lt;Control&gt; and &lt;META&gt; modifier keys are
commonly used, Emacs supports three other modifier keys.  These are
called &lt;Super&gt;, &lt;Hyper&gt; and &lt;Alt&gt;.  Few terminals provide
ways to use these modifiers; the key labeled &lt;Alt&gt; on most
keyboards usually issues the &lt;META&gt; modifier, not &lt;Alt&gt;.  The
standard key bindings in Emacs do not include any characters with
these modifiers.  However, you can customize Emacs to assign meanings
to them.  The modifier bits are labeled as `<samp><span class="samp">s-</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">H-</span></samp>' and
`<samp><span class="samp">A-</span></samp>' respectively.

   <p>Even if your keyboard lacks these additional modifier keys, you can
enter it using <kbd>C-x @</kbd>: <kbd>C-x @ h</kbd> adds the Hyper flag to
the next character, <kbd>C-x @ s</kbd> adds the Super flag, and
<kbd>C-x @ a</kbd> adds the Alt flag.  For instance, <kbd>C-x @ h
C-a</kbd> is a way to enter <kbd>Hyper-Control-a</kbd>.  (Unfortunately, there
is no way to add two modifiers by using <kbd>C-x @</kbd> twice for the
same character, because the first one goes to work on the <kbd>C-x</kbd>.)

<h4 class="subsection">51.3.8 Rebinding Function Keys</h4>

<p>Key sequences can contain function keys as well as ordinary
characters.  Just as Lisp characters (actually integers) represent
keyboard characters, Lisp symbols represent function keys.  If the
function key has a word as its label, then that word is also the name of
the corresponding Lisp symbol.  Here are the conventional Lisp names for
common function keys:

     <dl>
<dt><code>LEFT</code>, <code>UP</code>, <code>RIGHT</code>, <code>DOWN</code><dd>Cursor arrow keys.

     <br><dt><code>Begin</code>, <code>End</code>, <code>Home</code>, <code>next</code>, <code>prior</code><dd>Other cursor repositioning keys.

     <br><dt><code>select</code>, <code>print</code>, <code>execute</code>, <code>backtab</code><dt><code>insert</code>, <code>undo</code>, <code>redo</code>, <code>clearline</code><dt><code>insertline</code>, <code>deleteline</code>, <code>insertchar</code>, <code>deletechar</code><dd>Miscellaneous function keys.

     <br><dt><code>f1</code>, <code>f2</code>, <small class="dots">...</small> <code>f35</code><dd>Numbered function keys (across the top of the keyboard).

     <br><dt><code>kp-add</code>, <code>kp-subtract</code>, <code>kp-multiply</code>, <code>kp-divide</code><dt><code>kp-backtab</code>, <code>kp-space</code>, <code>kp-tab</code>, <code>kp-enter</code><dt><code>kp-separator</code>, <code>kp-decimal</code>, <code>kp-equal</code><dd>Keypad keys (to the right of the regular keyboard), with names or punctuation.

     <br><dt><code>kp-0</code>, <code>kp-1</code>, <small class="dots">...</small> <code>kp-9</code><dd>Keypad keys with digits.

     <br><dt><code>kp-f1</code>, <code>kp-f2</code>, <code>kp-f3</code>, <code>kp-f4</code><dd>Keypad PF keys. 
</dl>

   <p>These names are conventional, but some systems (especially when using
X) may use different names.  To make certain what symbol is used for a
given function key on your terminal, type <kbd>C-h c</kbd> followed by that
key.

   <p>See <a href="#Init-Rebinding">Init Rebinding</a>, for examples of binding function keys.

   <p><a name="index-keypad-4720"></a>  Many keyboards have a numeric keypad on the right hand side. 
The numeric keys in the keypad double up as cursor motion keys,
toggled by a key labeled `<samp><span class="samp">Num Lock</span></samp>'.  By default, Emacs
translates these keys to the corresponding keys in the main keyboard. 
For example, when `<samp><span class="samp">Num Lock</span></samp>' is on, the key labeled `<samp><span class="samp">8</span></samp>' on
the numeric keypad produces <code>kp-8</code>, which is translated to
<kbd>8</kbd>; when `<samp><span class="samp">Num Lock</span></samp>' is off, the same key produces
<code>kp-up</code>, which is translated to &lt;UP&gt;.  If you rebind a key
such as <kbd>8</kbd> or &lt;UP&gt;, it affects the equivalent keypad key too. 
However, if you rebind a `<samp><span class="samp">kp-</span></samp>' key directly, that won't affect
its non-keypad equivalent.  Note that the modified keys are not
translated: for instance, if you hold down the &lt;META&gt; key while
pressing the `<samp><span class="samp">8</span></samp>' key on the numeric keypad, that generates
<kbd>M-&lt;kp-8&gt;</kbd>.

   <p>Emacs provides a convenient method for binding the numeric keypad
keys, using the variables <code>keypad-setup</code>,
<code>keypad-numlock-setup</code>, <code>keypad-shifted-setup</code>, and
<code>keypad-numlock-shifted-setup</code>.  These can be found in the
`<samp><span class="samp">keyboard</span></samp>' customization group (see <a href="#Easy-Customization">Easy Customization</a>).  You
can rebind the keys to perform other tasks, such as issuing numeric
prefix arguments.

<h4 class="subsection">51.3.9 Named <acronym>ASCII</acronym> Control Characters</h4>

<p>&lt;TAB&gt;, &lt;RET&gt;, &lt;BS&gt;, &lt;LFD&gt;, &lt;ESC&gt; and &lt;DEL&gt;
started out as names for certain <acronym>ASCII</acronym> control characters,
used so often that they have special keys of their own.  For instance,
&lt;TAB&gt; was another name for <kbd>C-i</kbd>.  Later, users found it
convenient to distinguish in Emacs between these keys and the corresponding
control characters typed with the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key.  Therefore, on most
modern terminals, they are no longer the same: &lt;TAB&gt; is different
from <kbd>C-i</kbd>.

   <p>Emacs can distinguish these two kinds of input if the keyboard does. 
It treats the special keys as function keys named <code>tab</code>,
<code>return</code>, <code>backspace</code>, <code>linefeed</code>, <code>escape</code>, and
<code>delete</code>.  These function keys translate automatically into the
corresponding <acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters <em>if</em> they have no
bindings of their own.  As a result, neither users nor Lisp programs
need to pay attention to the distinction unless they care to.

   <p>If you do not want to distinguish between (for example) &lt;TAB&gt; and
<kbd>C-i</kbd>, make just one binding, for the <acronym>ASCII</acronym> character &lt;TAB&gt;
(octal code 011).  If you do want to distinguish, make one binding for
this <acronym>ASCII</acronym> character, and another for the function key <code>tab</code>.

   <p>With an ordinary <acronym>ASCII</acronym> terminal, there is no way to distinguish
between &lt;TAB&gt; and <kbd>C-i</kbd> (and likewise for other such pairs),
because the terminal sends the same character in both cases.

<h4 class="subsection">51.3.10 Rebinding Mouse Buttons</h4>

<p><a name="index-mouse-button-events-4721"></a><a name="index-rebinding-mouse-buttons-4722"></a><a name="index-click-events-4723"></a><a name="index-drag-events-4724"></a><a name="index-down-events-4725"></a><a name="index-button-down-events-4726"></a>
  Emacs uses Lisp symbols to designate mouse buttons, too.  The ordinary
mouse events in Emacs are <dfn>click</dfn> events; these happen when you
press a button and release it without moving the mouse.  You can also
get <dfn>drag</dfn> events, when you move the mouse while holding the button
down.  Drag events happen when you finally let go of the button.

   <p>The symbols for basic click events are <code>mouse-1</code> for the leftmost
button, <code>mouse-2</code> for the next, and so on.  Here is how you can
redefine the second mouse button to split the current window:

<pre class="example">     (global-set-key [mouse-2] 'split-window-below)
</pre>
   <p>The symbols for drag events are similar, but have the prefix
`<samp><span class="samp">drag-</span></samp>' before the word `<samp><span class="samp">mouse</span></samp>'.  For example, dragging the
first button generates a <code>drag-mouse-1</code> event.

   <p>You can also define bindings for events that occur when a mouse button
is pressed down.  These events start with `<samp><span class="samp">down-</span></samp>' instead of
`<samp><span class="samp">drag-</span></samp>'.  Such events are generated only if they have key bindings. 
When you get a button-down event, a corresponding click or drag event
will always follow.

   <p><a name="index-double-clicks-4727"></a><a name="index-triple-clicks-4728"></a>  If you wish, you can distinguish single, double, and triple clicks.  A
double click means clicking a mouse button twice in approximately the
same place.  The first click generates an ordinary click event.  The
second click, if it comes soon enough, generates a double-click event
instead.  The event type for a double-click event starts with
`<samp><span class="samp">double-</span></samp>': for example, <code>double-mouse-3</code>.

   <p>This means that you can give a special meaning to the second click at
the same place, but it must act on the assumption that the ordinary
single click definition has run when the first click was received.

   <p>This constrains what you can do with double clicks, but user interface
designers say that this constraint ought to be followed in any case.  A
double click should do something similar to the single click, only
more so.  The command for the double-click event should perform the
extra work for the double click.

   <p>If a double-click event has no binding, it changes to the
corresponding single-click event.  Thus, if you don't define a
particular double click specially, it executes the single-click command
twice.

   <p>Emacs also supports triple-click events whose names start with
`<samp><span class="samp">triple-</span></samp>'.  Emacs does not distinguish quadruple clicks as event
types; clicks beyond the third generate additional triple-click events. 
However, the full number of clicks is recorded in the event list, so
if you know Emacs Lisp you can distinguish if you really want to
(see <a href="elisp.html#Click-Events">Click Events</a>). 
We don't recommend distinct meanings for more than three clicks, but
sometimes it is useful for subsequent clicks to cycle through the same
set of three meanings, so that four clicks are equivalent to one
click, five are equivalent to two, and six are equivalent to three.

   <p>Emacs also records multiple presses in drag and button-down events. 
For example, when you press a button twice, then move the mouse while
holding the button, Emacs gets a `<samp><span class="samp">double-drag-</span></samp>' event.  And at the
moment when you press it down for the second time, Emacs gets a
`<samp><span class="samp">double-down-</span></samp>' event (which is ignored, like all button-down
events, if it has no binding).

   <p><a name="index-double_002dclick_002dtime-4729"></a>  The variable <code>double-click-time</code> specifies how much time can
elapse between clicks and still allow them to be grouped as a multiple
click.  Its value is in units of milliseconds.  If the value is
<code>nil</code>, double clicks are not detected at all.  If the value is
<code>t</code>, then there is no time limit.  The default is 500.

   <p><a name="index-double_002dclick_002dfuzz-4730"></a>  The variable <code>double-click-fuzz</code> specifies how much the mouse
can move between clicks and still allow them to be grouped as a multiple
click.  Its value is in units of pixels on windowed displays and in
units of 1/8 of a character cell on text-mode terminals; the default is
3.

   <p>The symbols for mouse events also indicate the status of the modifier
keys, with the usual prefixes `<samp><span class="samp">C-</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">M-</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">H-</span></samp>',
`<samp><span class="samp">s-</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">A-</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">S-</span></samp>'.  These always precede `<samp><span class="samp">double-</span></samp>'
or `<samp><span class="samp">triple-</span></samp>', which always precede `<samp><span class="samp">drag-</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">down-</span></samp>'.

   <p>A frame includes areas that don't show text from the buffer, such as
the mode line and the scroll bar.  You can tell whether a mouse button
comes from a special area of the screen by means of dummy prefix
keys.  For example, if you click the mouse in the mode line, you get
the prefix key <code>mode-line</code> before the ordinary mouse-button symbol. 
Thus, here is how to define the command for clicking the first button in
a mode line to run <code>scroll-up-command</code>:

<pre class="example">     (global-set-key [mode-line mouse-1] 'scroll-up-command)
</pre>
   <p>Here is the complete list of these dummy prefix keys and their
meanings:

     <dl>
<dt><code>mode-line</code><dd>The mouse was in the mode line of a window. 
<br><dt><code>vertical-line</code><dd>The mouse was in the vertical line separating side-by-side windows.  (If
you use scroll bars, they appear in place of these vertical lines.) 
<br><dt><code>vertical-scroll-bar</code><dd>The mouse was in a vertical scroll bar.  (This is the only kind of
scroll bar Emacs currently supports.) 
<br><dt><code>menu-bar</code><dd>The mouse was in the menu bar. 
<br><dt><code>header-line</code><dd>The mouse was in a header line. 
</dl>

   <p>You can put more than one mouse button in a key sequence, but it isn't
usual to do so.

<h4 class="subsection">51.3.11 Disabling Commands</h4>

<p><a name="index-disabled-command-4731"></a>
  Disabling a command means that invoking it interactively asks for
confirmation from the user.  The purpose of disabling a command is to
prevent users from executing it by accident; we do this for commands
that might be confusing to the uninitiated.

   <p>Attempting to invoke a disabled command interactively in Emacs
displays a window containing the command's name, its documentation,
and some instructions on what to do immediately; then Emacs asks for
input saying whether to execute the command as requested, enable it
and execute it, or cancel.  If you decide to enable the command, you
must then answer another question&mdash;whether to do this permanently, or
just for the current session.  (Enabling permanently works by
automatically editing your initialization file.)  You can also type
<kbd>!</kbd> to enable <em>all</em> commands, for the current session only.

   <p>The direct mechanism for disabling a command is to put a
non-<code>nil</code> <code>disabled</code> property on the Lisp symbol for the
command.  Here is the Lisp program to do this:

<pre class="example">     (put 'delete-region 'disabled t)
</pre>
   <p>If the value of the <code>disabled</code> property is a string, that string
is included in the message displayed when the command is used:

<pre class="example">     (put 'delete-region 'disabled
          "It's better to use `kill-region' instead.\n")
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-disable_002dcommand-4732"></a><a name="index-enable_002dcommand-4733"></a>  You can make a command disabled either by editing the initialization
file directly, or with the command <kbd>M-x disable-command</kbd>, which
edits the initialization file for you.  Likewise, <kbd>M-x
enable-command</kbd> edits the initialization file to enable a command
permanently.  See <a href="#Init-File">Init File</a>.

   <p>If Emacs was invoked with the <samp><span class="option">-q</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">--no-init-file</span></samp>
options (see <a href="#Initial-Options">Initial Options</a>), it will not edit your
initialization file.  Doing so could lose information because Emacs
has not read your initialization file.

   <p>Whether a command is disabled is independent of what key is used to
invoke it; disabling also applies if the command is invoked using
<kbd>M-x</kbd>.  However, disabling a command has no effect on calling it
as a function from Lisp programs.

<h3 class="section">51.4 The Emacs Initialization File</h3>

<p><a name="index-init-file-4734"></a><a name="index-g_t_002eemacs-file-4735"></a><a name="index-g_t_007e_002f_002eemacs-file-4736"></a><a name="index-Emacs-initialization-file-4737"></a><a name="index-key-rebinding_002c-permanent-4738"></a><a name="index-rebinding-keys_002c-permanently-4739"></a><a name="index-startup-_0028init-file_0029-4740"></a>
  When Emacs is started, it normally tries to load a Lisp program from
an <dfn>initialization file</dfn>, or <dfn>init file</dfn> for short.  This
file, if it exists, specifies how to initialize Emacs for you.  Emacs
looks for your init file using the filenames <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="file">~/.emacs.el</span></samp>, or <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs.d/init.el</span></samp>; you can choose to
use any one of these three names (see <a href="#Find-Init">Find Init</a>).  Here, <samp><span class="file">~/</span></samp>
stands for your home directory.

   <p>You can use the command line switch `<samp><span class="samp">-q</span></samp>' to prevent loading
your init file, and `<samp><span class="samp">-u</span></samp>' (or `<samp><span class="samp">--user</span></samp>') to specify a
different user's init file (see <a href="#Initial-Options">Initial Options</a>).

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007bdefault_002eel_007d_002c-the-default-init-file-4741"></a>  There can also be a <dfn>default init file</dfn>, which is the library
named <samp><span class="file">default.el</span></samp>, found via the standard search path for
libraries.  The Emacs distribution contains no such library; your site
may create one for local customizations.  If this library exists, it is
loaded whenever you start Emacs (except when you specify `<samp><span class="samp">-q</span></samp>'). 
But your init file, if any, is loaded first; if it sets
<code>inhibit-default-init</code> non-<code>nil</code>, then <samp><span class="file">default</span></samp> is not
loaded.

   <p><a name="index-site-init-file-4742"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007bsite_002dstart_002eel_007d_002c-the-site-startup-file-4743"></a>  Your site may also have a <dfn>site startup file</dfn>; this is named
<samp><span class="file">site-start.el</span></samp>, if it exists.  Like <samp><span class="file">default.el</span></samp>, Emacs
finds this file via the standard search path for Lisp libraries. 
Emacs loads this library before it loads your init file.  To inhibit
loading of this library, use the option `<samp><span class="samp">--no-site-file</span></samp>'. 
See <a href="#Initial-Options">Initial Options</a>.  We recommend against using
<samp><span class="file">site-start.el</span></samp> for changes that some users may not like.  It is
better to put them in <samp><span class="file">default.el</span></samp>, so that users can more easily
override them.

   <p><a name="index-site_002dlisp-directories-4744"></a>  You can place <samp><span class="file">default.el</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">site-start.el</span></samp> in any of
the directories which Emacs searches for Lisp libraries.  The variable
<code>load-path</code> (see <a href="#Lisp-Libraries">Lisp Libraries</a>) specifies these directories. 
Many sites put these files in a subdirectory named <samp><span class="file">site-lisp</span></samp> in
the Emacs installation directory, such as
<samp><span class="file">/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp</span></samp>.

   <p>Byte-compiling your init file is not recommended (see <a href="elisp.html#Byte-Compilation">Byte Compilation</a>).  It generally does not speed up startup very much, and often
leads to problems when you forget to recompile the file.  A better
solution is to use the Emacs server to reduce the number of times you
have to start Emacs (see <a href="#Emacs-Server">Emacs Server</a>).  If your init file defines
many functions, consider moving them to a separate (byte-compiled)
file that you load in your init file.

   <p>If you are going to write actual Emacs Lisp programs that go beyond
minor customization, you should read the <cite>Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</cite>.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">51.4.1 Init File Syntax</h4>

<p>The init file contains one or more Lisp expressions.  Each of these
consists of a function name followed by arguments, all surrounded by
parentheses.  For example, <code>(setq fill-column 60)</code> calls the
function <code>setq</code> to set the variable <code>fill-column</code>
(see <a href="#Filling">Filling</a>) to 60.

   <p>You can set any Lisp variable with <code>setq</code>, but with certain
variables <code>setq</code> won't do what you probably want in the
<samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file.  Some variables automatically become buffer-local
when set with <code>setq</code>; what you want in <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> is to set
the default value, using <code>setq-default</code>.  Some customizable minor
mode variables do special things to enable the mode when you set them
with Customize, but ordinary <code>setq</code> won't do that; to enable the
mode in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file, call the minor mode command.  The
following section has examples of both of these methods.

   <p>The second argument to <code>setq</code> is an expression for the new
value of the variable.  This can be a constant, a variable, or a
function call expression.  In <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>, constants are used most
of the time.  They can be:

     <dl>
<dt>Numbers:<dd>Numbers are written in decimal, with an optional initial minus sign.

     <br><dt>Strings:<dd><a name="index-Lisp-string-syntax-4745"></a><a name="index-string-syntax-4746"></a>Lisp string syntax is the same as C string syntax with a few extra
features.  Use a double-quote character to begin and end a string constant.

     <p>In a string, you can include newlines and special characters literally. 
But often it is cleaner to use backslash sequences for them: `<samp><span class="samp">\n</span></samp>'
for newline, `<samp><span class="samp">\b</span></samp>' for backspace, `<samp><span class="samp">\r</span></samp>' for carriage return,
`<samp><span class="samp">\t</span></samp>' for tab, `<samp><span class="samp">\f</span></samp>' for formfeed (control-L), `<samp><span class="samp">\e</span></samp>' for
escape, `<samp><span class="samp">\\</span></samp>' for a backslash, `<samp><span class="samp">\"</span></samp>' for a double-quote, or
`<samp><span class="samp">\</span><var>ooo</var></samp>' for the character whose octal code is <var>ooo</var>. 
Backslash and double-quote are the only characters for which backslash
sequences are mandatory.

     <p>`<samp><span class="samp">\C-</span></samp>' can be used as a prefix for a control character, as in
`<samp><span class="samp">\C-s</span></samp>' for <acronym>ASCII</acronym> control-S, and `<samp><span class="samp">\M-</span></samp>' can be used as a prefix for
a Meta character, as in `<samp><span class="samp">\M-a</span></samp>' for <kbd>&lt;META&gt;-A</kbd> or
`<samp><span class="samp">\M-\C-a</span></samp>' for <kbd>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-&lt;META&gt;-A</kbd>.

     <p>See <a href="#Init-Non_002dASCII">Init Non-ASCII</a>, for information about including
non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> in your init file.

     <br><dt>Characters:<dd><a name="index-Lisp-character-syntax-4747"></a><a name="index-character-syntax-4748"></a>Lisp character constant syntax consists of a `<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>' followed by
either a character or an escape sequence starting with `<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>'. 
Examples: <code>?x</code>, <code>?\n</code>, <code>?\"</code>, <code>?\)</code>.  Note that
strings and characters are not interchangeable in Lisp; some contexts
require one and some contexts require the other.

<h4 class="subsection">51.4.2 Init File Examples</h4>

<p>Here are some examples of doing certain commonly desired things with
Lisp expressions:

     <ul>
<li>Add a directory to the variable <code>load-path</code>.  You can then put
Lisp libraries that are not included with Emacs in this directory, and
load them with <kbd>M-x load-library</kbd>.  See <a href="#Lisp-Libraries">Lisp Libraries</a>.

     <pre class="example">          (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/lisp/libraries")
     </pre>
     <li>Make &lt;TAB&gt; in C mode just insert a tab if point is in the middle of a
line.

     <pre class="example">          (setq c-tab-always-indent nil)
     </pre>
     <p>Here we have a variable whose value is normally <code>t</code> for &ldquo;true&rdquo;
and the alternative is <code>nil</code> for &ldquo;false&rdquo;.

     <li>Make searches case sensitive by default (in all buffers that do not
override this).

     <pre class="example">          (setq-default case-fold-search nil)
     </pre>
     <p>This sets the default value, which is effective in all buffers that do
not have local values for the variable (see <a href="#Locals">Locals</a>).  Setting
<code>case-fold-search</code> with <code>setq</code> affects only the current
buffer's local value, which is probably not what you want to do in an
init file.

     <li><a name="index-user_002dmail_002daddress-4750"></a>Specify your own email address, if Emacs can't figure it out correctly.

     <pre class="example">          (setq user-mail-address "cheney@torture.gov")
     </pre>
     <p>Various Emacs packages, such as Message mode, consult
<code>user-mail-address</code> when they need to know your email address. 
See <a href="#Mail-Headers">Mail Headers</a>.

     <li>Make Text mode the default mode for new buffers.

     <pre class="example">          (setq-default major-mode 'text-mode)
     </pre>
     <p>Note that <code>text-mode</code> is used because it is the command for
entering Text mode.  The single-quote before it makes the symbol a
constant; otherwise, <code>text-mode</code> would be treated as a variable
name.

     <li>Set up defaults for the Latin-1 character set
which supports most of the languages of Western Europe.

     <pre class="example">          (set-language-environment "Latin-1")
     </pre>
     <li>Turn off Line Number mode, a global minor mode.

     <pre class="example">          (line-number-mode 0)
     </pre>
     <li>Turn on Auto Fill mode automatically in Text mode and related modes
(see <a href="#Hooks">Hooks</a>).

     <pre class="example">          (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'auto-fill-mode)
     </pre>
     <li>Load the installed Lisp library named <samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp> (actually a file
<samp><span class="file">foo.elc</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">foo.el</span></samp> in a standard Emacs directory).

     <pre class="example">          (load "foo")
     </pre>
     <p>When the argument to <code>load</code> is a relative file name, not starting
with `<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">~</span></samp>', <code>load</code> searches the directories in
<code>load-path</code> (see <a href="#Lisp-Libraries">Lisp Libraries</a>).

     <li>Load the compiled Lisp file <samp><span class="file">foo.elc</span></samp> from your home directory.

     <pre class="example">          (load "~/foo.elc")
     </pre>
     <p>Here a full file name is used, so no searching is done.

     <li><a name="index-loading-Lisp-libraries-automatically-4751"></a><a name="index-autoload-Lisp-libraries-4752"></a>Tell Emacs to find the definition for the function <code>myfunction</code>
by loading a Lisp library named <samp><span class="file">mypackage</span></samp> (i.e., a file
<samp><span class="file">mypackage.elc</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">mypackage.el</span></samp>):

     <pre class="example">          (autoload 'myfunction "mypackage" "Do what I say." t)
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">Here the string <code>"Do what I say."</code> is the function's
documentation string.  You specify it in the <code>autoload</code>
definition so it will be available for help commands even when the
package is not loaded.  The last argument, <code>t</code>, indicates that
this function is interactive; that is, it can be invoked interactively
by typing <kbd>M-x myfunction &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> or by binding it to a key. 
If the function is not interactive, omit the <code>t</code> or use
<code>nil</code>.

     <li>Rebind the key <kbd>C-x l</kbd> to run the function <code>make-symbolic-link</code>
(see <a href="#Init-Rebinding">Init Rebinding</a>).

     <pre class="example">          (global-set-key "\C-xl" 'make-symbolic-link)
     </pre>
     <p>or

     <pre class="example">          (define-key global-map "\C-xl" 'make-symbolic-link)

     <p>Note once again the single-quote used to refer to the symbol
<code>make-symbolic-link</code> instead of its value as a variable.

     <li>Do the same thing for Lisp mode only.

     <li>Redefine all keys which now run <code>next-line</code> in Fundamental mode

     <pre class="example">          (substitute-key-definition 'next-line 'forward-line

     <pre class="example">          (global-unset-key "\C-x\C-v")

     <p>One reason to undefine a key is so that you can make it a prefix. 
Simply defining <kbd>C-x C-v </kbd><var>anything</var> will make <kbd>C-x C-v</kbd> a

     <li>Adjusting the configuration to various platforms and Emacs versions.

     <p>Users typically want Emacs to behave the same on all systems, so the
same init file is right for all platforms.  However, sometimes it
happens that a function you use for customizing Emacs is not available
on some platforms or in older Emacs versions.  To deal with that
situation, put the customization inside a conditional that tests whether
the function or facility is available, like this:

     <pre class="example">          (if (fboundp 'blink-cursor-mode)
              (blink-cursor-mode 0))
          
          (if (boundp 'coding-category-utf-8)
              (set-coding-priority '(coding-category-utf-8)))
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">You can also simply disregard the errors that occur if the
function is not defined.

     <pre class="example">          (ignore-errors (set-face-background 'region "grey75"))
     </pre>
     <p>A <code>setq</code> on a variable which does not exist is generally
harmless, so those do not need a conditional.

<h4 class="subsection">51.4.3 Terminal-specific Initialization</h4>

<p><a name="index-term_002dfile_002daliases-4754"></a>  Each terminal type can have a Lisp library to be loaded into Emacs when
it is run on that type of terminal.  For a terminal type named
<var>termtype</var>, the library is called <samp><span class="file">term/</span><var>termtype</var></samp>. 
(If there is an entry of the form <code>(</code><var>termtype</var><code> . </code><var>alias</var><code>)</code>
in the <code>term-file-aliases</code> association list, Emacs uses
<var>alias</var> in place of <var>termtype</var>.)  The library is
found by searching the directories <code>load-path</code> as usual and trying the
suffixes `<samp><span class="samp">.elc</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">.el</span></samp>'.  Normally it appears in the
subdirectory <samp><span class="file">term</span></samp> of the directory where most Emacs libraries are
kept.

   <p>The usual purpose of the terminal-specific library is to map the
escape sequences used by the terminal's function keys onto more
meaningful names, using <code>input-decode-map</code> (or
<code>function-key-map</code> before it).  See the file
<samp><span class="file">term/lk201.el</span></samp> for an example of how this is done.  Many function
keys are mapped automatically according to the information in the
Termcap data base; the terminal-specific library needs to map only the
function keys that Termcap does not specify.

   <p>When the terminal type contains a hyphen, only the part of the name
before the first hyphen is significant in choosing the library name. 
Thus, terminal types `<samp><span class="samp">aaa-48</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">aaa-30-rv</span></samp>' both use
the library <samp><span class="file">term/aaa</span></samp>.  The code in the library can use
<code>(getenv "TERM")</code> to find the full terminal type name.

   <p><a name="index-term_002dfile_002dprefix-4755"></a>  The library's name is constructed by concatenating the value of the
variable <code>term-file-prefix</code> and the terminal type.  Your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>
file can prevent the loading of the terminal-specific library by setting
<code>term-file-prefix</code> to <code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-tty_002dsetup_002dhook-4756"></a>  Emacs runs the hook <code>tty-setup-hook</code> at the end of
initialization, after both your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file and any
terminal-specific library have been read in.  Add hook functions to this
hook if you wish to override part of any of the terminal-specific
libraries and to define initializations for terminals that do not have a
library.  See <a href="#Hooks">Hooks</a>.

<h4 class="subsection">51.4.4 How Emacs Finds Your Init File</h4>

<p>Normally Emacs uses the environment variable <samp><span class="env">HOME</span></samp>
(see <a href="#General-Variables">HOME</a>) to find <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>; that's what
`<samp><span class="samp">~</span></samp>' means in a file name.  If <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> is not found inside
<samp><span class="file">~/</span></samp> (nor <samp><span class="file">.emacs.el</span></samp>), Emacs looks for
<samp><span class="file">~/.emacs.d/init.el</span></samp> (which, like <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs.el</span></samp>, can be
byte-compiled).

   <p>However, if you run Emacs from a shell started by <code>su</code>, Emacs
tries to find your own <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>, not that of the user you are
currently pretending to be.  The idea is that you should get your own
editor customizations even if you are running as the super user.

   <p>More precisely, Emacs first determines which user's init file to use. 
It gets your user name from the environment variables <samp><span class="env">LOGNAME</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="env">USER</span></samp>; if neither of those exists, it uses effective user-ID. 
If that user name matches the real user-ID, then Emacs uses <samp><span class="env">HOME</span></samp>;
otherwise, it looks up the home directory corresponding to that user
name in the system's data base of users.

<h4 class="subsection">51.4.5 Non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> Characters in Init Files</h4>

<p><a name="index-international-characters-in-_0040file_007b_002eemacs_007d-4757"></a><a name="index-non_002d_0040acronym_007bASCII_007d-characters-in-_0040file_007b_002eemacs_007d-4758"></a><a name="index-non_002d_0040acronym_007bASCII_007d-keys_002c-binding-4759"></a><a name="index-rebinding-non_002d_0040acronym_007bASCII_007d-keys-4760"></a>
  Language and coding systems may cause problems if your init file
contains non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters, such as accented letters, in
strings or key bindings.

   <p>If you want to use non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters in your init file,
you should put a `<samp><span class="samp">-*-coding:&nbsp;</span><var>coding-system</var><span class="samp">-*-</span></samp>'<!-- /@w --> tag on
the first line of the init file, and specify a coding system that
supports the character(s) in question.  See <a href="#Recognize-Coding">Recognize Coding</a>.  This
is because the defaults for decoding non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> text might
not yet be set up by the time Emacs reads those parts of your init
file which use such strings, possibly leading Emacs to decode those
strings incorrectly.  You should then avoid adding Emacs Lisp code
that modifies the coding system in other ways, such as calls to
<code>set-language-environment</code>.

   <p>To bind non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> keys, you must use a vector (see <a href="#Init-Rebinding">Init Rebinding</a>).  The string syntax cannot be used, since the
non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters will be interpreted as meta keys.  For
instance:

<pre class="example">     (global-set-key [?<var>char</var>] 'some-function)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Type <kbd>C-q</kbd>, followed by the key you want to bind, to insert <var>char</var>.

   <p><strong>Warning:</strong> if you change the keyboard encoding, or change
between multibyte and unibyte mode, or anything that would alter which
code <kbd>C-q</kbd> would insert for that character, this key binding may
stop working.  It is therefore advisable to use one and only one
coding system, for your init file as well as the files you edit.  For
example, don't mix the `<samp><span class="samp">latin-1</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">latin-9</span></samp>' coding
systems.

<h2 class="chapter">52 Quitting and Aborting</h2>

<p><a name="index-quitting-4761"></a>
     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-g</kbd><dt><kbd>C-&lt;Break&gt; </kbd><span class="roman">(MS-DOS only)</span><dd>Quit: cancel running or partially typed command. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-]</kbd><dd>Abort innermost recursive editing level and cancel the command which
invoked it (<code>abort-recursive-edit</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; &lt;ESC&gt; &lt;ESC&gt;</kbd><dd>Either quit or abort, whichever makes sense (<code>keyboard-escape-quit</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x top-level</kbd><dd>Abort all recursive editing levels that are currently executing. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-/</kbd><dt><kbd>C-x u</kbd><dt><kbd>C-_</kbd><dd>Cancel a previously made change in the buffer contents (<code>undo</code>). 
</dl>

   <p>There are two ways of canceling a command before it has finished:
<dfn>quitting</dfn> with <kbd>C-g</kbd>, and <dfn>aborting</dfn> with <kbd>C-]</kbd> or
<kbd>M-x top-level</kbd>.  Quitting cancels a partially typed command, or
one which is still running.  Aborting exits a recursive editing level
and cancels the command that invoked the recursive edit
(see <a href="#Recursive-Edit">Recursive Edit</a>).

   <p><a name="index-quitting-4762"></a><a name="index-C_002dg-4763"></a>  Quitting with <kbd>C-g</kbd> is the way to get rid of a partially typed
command, or a numeric argument that you don't want.  Furthermore, if
you are in the middle of a command that is running, <kbd>C-g</kbd> stops
the command in a relatively safe way.  For example, if you quit out of
a kill command that is taking a long time, either your text will
<em>all</em> still be in the buffer, or it will <em>all</em> be in the
kill ring, or maybe both.  If the region is active, <kbd>C-g</kbd>
deactivates the mark, unless Transient Mark mode is off
(see <a href="#Disabled-Transient-Mark">Disabled Transient Mark</a>).  If you are in the middle of an
incremental search, <kbd>C-g</kbd> behaves specially; it may take two
successive <kbd>C-g</kbd> characters to get out of a search. 
See <a href="#Incremental-Search">Incremental Search</a>, for details.

   <p>On MS-DOS, the character <kbd>C-&lt;Break&gt;</kbd> serves as a quit character
like <kbd>C-g</kbd>.  The reason is that it is not feasible, on MS-DOS, to
recognize <kbd>C-g</kbd> while a command is running, between interactions
with the user.  By contrast, it <em>is</em> feasible to recognize
<kbd>C-&lt;Break&gt;</kbd> at all times. 
See <a href="#MS_002dDOS-Keyboard">MS-DOS Keyboard</a>.

   <p><a name="index-keyboard_002dquit-4764"></a>  <kbd>C-g</kbd> works by setting the variable <code>quit-flag</code> to <code>t</code>
the instant <kbd>C-g</kbd> is typed; Emacs Lisp checks this variable
frequently, and quits if it is non-<code>nil</code>.  <kbd>C-g</kbd> is only
actually executed as a command if you type it while Emacs is waiting for
input.  In that case, the command it runs is <code>keyboard-quit</code>.

   <p>On a text terminal, if you quit with <kbd>C-g</kbd> a second time before
the first <kbd>C-g</kbd> is recognized, you activate the emergency-escape
feature and return to the shell.  See <a href="#Emergency-Escape">Emergency Escape</a>.

   <p><a name="index-NFS-and-quitting-4765"></a>  There are some situations where you cannot quit.  When Emacs is
waiting for the operating system to do something, quitting is
impossible unless special pains are taken for the particular system
call within Emacs where the waiting occurs.  We have done this for the
system calls that users are likely to want to quit from, but it's
possible you will encounter a case not handled.  In one very common
case&mdash;waiting for file input or output using NFS&mdash;Emacs itself knows
how to quit, but many NFS implementations simply do not allow user
programs to stop waiting for NFS when the NFS server is hung.

   <p><a name="index-aborting-recursive-edit-4766"></a><a name="index-abort_002drecursive_002dedit-4767"></a><a name="index-C_002d_005d-4768"></a>  Aborting with <kbd>C-]</kbd> (<code>abort-recursive-edit</code>) is used to get
out of a recursive editing level and cancel the command which invoked
it.  Quitting with <kbd>C-g</kbd> does not do this, and could not do this,
because it is used to cancel a partially typed command <em>within</em> the
recursive editing level.  Both operations are useful.  For example, if
you are in a recursive edit and type <kbd>C-u 8</kbd> to enter a numeric
argument, you can cancel that argument with <kbd>C-g</kbd> and remain in the
recursive edit.

   <p><a name="index-keyboard_002descape_002dquit-4769"></a><a name="index-ESC-ESC-ESC-4770"></a>  The sequence <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; &lt;ESC&gt; &lt;ESC&gt;</kbd>
(<code>keyboard-escape-quit</code>) can either quit or abort.  (We defined
it this way because &lt;ESC&gt; means &ldquo;get out&rdquo; in many PC programs.) 
It can cancel a prefix argument, clear a selected region, or get out
of a Query Replace, like <kbd>C-g</kbd>.  It can get out of the minibuffer
or a recursive edit, like <kbd>C-]</kbd>.  It can also get out of splitting
the frame into multiple windows, as with <kbd>C-x 1</kbd>.  One thing it
cannot do, however, is stop a command that is running.  That's because
it executes as an ordinary command, and Emacs doesn't notice it until
it is ready for the next command.

   <p><a name="index-top_002dlevel-4771"></a>  The command <kbd>M-x top-level</kbd> is equivalent to enough
<kbd>C-]</kbd> commands to get you out of all the levels of recursive edits
that you are in; it also exits the minibuffer if it is active. 
<kbd>C-]</kbd> gets you out one level at a time, but <kbd>M-x top-level</kbd>
goes out all levels at once.  Both <kbd>C-]</kbd> and <kbd>M-x top-level</kbd>
are like all other commands, and unlike <kbd>C-g</kbd>, in that they take
effect only when Emacs is ready for a command.  <kbd>C-]</kbd> is an
ordinary key and has its meaning only because of its binding in the
keymap.  See <a href="#Recursive-Edit">Recursive Edit</a>.

   <p><kbd>C-/</kbd> (<code>undo</code>) is not strictly speaking a way of canceling
a command, but you can think of it as canceling a command that already
finished executing.  See <a href="#Undo">Undo</a>, for more information about the undo
facility.

<h3 class="section">53.1 If &lt;DEL&gt; Fails to Delete</h3>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040key_007bDEL_007d-vs-_0040key_007bBACKSPACE_007d-4773"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040key_007bBACKSPACE_007d-vs-_0040key_007bDEL_007d-4774"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040key_007bDEL_007d-does-not-delete-4775"></a>
  Every keyboard has a large key, usually labeled &lt;BACKSPACE&gt;,
which is ordinarily used to erase the last character that you typed. 
In Emacs, this key is supposed to be equivalent to &lt;DEL&gt;.

   <p>When Emacs starts up on a graphical display, it determines
automatically which key should be &lt;DEL&gt;.  In some unusual cases,
Emacs gets the wrong information from the system, and &lt;BACKSPACE&gt;
ends up deleting forwards instead of backwards.

   <p>Some keyboards also have a &lt;Delete&gt; key, which is ordinarily
used to delete forwards.  If this key deletes backward in Emacs, that
too suggests Emacs got the wrong information&mdash;but in the opposite
sense.

   <p>On a text terminal, if you find that &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; prompts for a
Help command, like <kbd>Control-h</kbd>, instead of deleting a character,
it means that key is actually sending the `<samp><span class="samp">BS</span></samp>' character.  Emacs
ought to be treating &lt;BS&gt; as &lt;DEL&gt;, but it isn't.

   <p><a name="index-normal_002derase_002dis_002dbackspace_002dmode-4776"></a>  In all of those cases, the immediate remedy is the same: use the
command <kbd>M-x normal-erase-is-backspace-mode</kbd>.  This toggles
between the two modes that Emacs supports for handling &lt;DEL&gt;, so
if Emacs starts in the wrong mode, this should switch to the right
mode.  On a text terminal, if you want to ask for help when &lt;BS&gt;
is treated as &lt;DEL&gt;, use &lt;F1&gt;; <kbd>C-?</kbd> may also work, if it
sends character code 127.

   <p>To fix the problem in every Emacs session, put one of the following
lines into your initialization file (see <a href="#Init-File">Init File</a>).  For the
first case above, where &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; deletes forwards instead of
backwards, use this line to make &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; act as &lt;DEL&gt;:

<pre class="lisp">     (normal-erase-is-backspace-mode 0)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">For the other two cases, use this line:

<pre class="lisp">     (normal-erase-is-backspace-mode 1)
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-normal_002derase_002dis_002dbackspace-4777"></a>  Another way to fix the problem for every Emacs session is to
customize the variable <code>normal-erase-is-backspace</code>: the value
<code>t</code> specifies the mode where &lt;BS&gt; or &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; is
&lt;DEL&gt;, and <code>nil</code> specifies the other mode.  See <a href="#Easy-Customization">Easy Customization</a>.

  Recursive editing levels are important and useful features of Emacs, but
they can seem like malfunctions if you do not understand them.

   <p>If the mode line has square brackets `<samp><span class="samp">[...]</span></samp>' around the
parentheses that contain the names of the major and minor modes, you
have entered a recursive editing level.  If you did not do this on
purpose, or if you don't understand what that means, you should just
get out of the recursive editing level.  To do so, type <kbd>M-x
top-level</kbd>.  See <a href="#Recursive-Edit">Recursive Edit</a>.

  If the text on a text terminal looks wrong, the first thing to do is
see whether it is wrong in the buffer.  Type <kbd>C-l</kbd> to redisplay
the entire screen.  If the screen appears correct after this, the
problem was entirely in the previous screen update.  (Otherwise, see
the following section.)

   <p>Display updating problems often result from an incorrect terminfo
entry for the terminal you are using.  The file <samp><span class="file">etc/TERMS</span></samp> in
the Emacs distribution gives the fixes for known problems of this
sort.  <samp><span class="file">INSTALL</span></samp> contains general advice for these problems in
one of its sections.  If you seem to be using the right terminfo
entry, it is possible that there is a bug in the terminfo entry, or a
bug in Emacs that appears for certain terminal types.

see what commands you typed to produce the observed results.  Then try
undoing the changes step by step using <kbd>C-x u</kbd>, until it gets back
to a state you consider correct.

   <p>If a large portion of text appears to be missing at the beginning or
end of the buffer, check for the word `<samp><span class="samp">Narrow</span></samp>' in the mode line. 
If it appears, the text you don't see is probably still present, but
temporarily off-limits.  To make it accessible again, type <kbd>C-x n
w</kbd>.  See <a href="#Narrowing">Narrowing</a>.

  If you get the error message `<samp><span class="samp">Virtual memory exceeded</span></samp>', save
your modified buffers with <kbd>C-x s</kbd>.  This method of saving them
has the smallest need for additional memory.  Emacs keeps a reserve of
memory which it makes available when this error happens; that should
be enough to enable <kbd>C-x s</kbd> to complete its work.  When the
reserve has been used, `<samp><span class="samp">!MEM FULL!</span></samp>' appears at the beginning of
the mode line, indicating there is no more reserve.

   <p>Once you have saved your modified buffers, you can exit this Emacs
session and start another, or you can use <kbd>M-x kill-some-buffers</kbd>
to free space in the current Emacs job.  If this frees up sufficient
space, Emacs will refill its memory reserve, and `<samp><span class="samp">!MEM FULL!</span></samp>'
will disappear from the mode line.  That means you can safely go on
editing in the same Emacs session.

   <p>Do not use <kbd>M-x buffer-menu</kbd> to save or kill buffers when you run
out of memory, because the Buffer Menu needs a fair amount of memory
itself, and the reserve supply may not be enough.

<h3 class="section">53.6 When Emacs Crashes</h3>

<p><a name="index-crash-report-4787"></a><a name="index-backtrace-4788"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007bemacs_005fbacktrace_002etxt_007d-file_002c-MS_002dWindows-4789"></a>  Emacs is not supposed to crash, but if it does, it produces a
<dfn>crash report</dfn> prior to exiting.  The crash report is printed to
the standard error stream.  If Emacs was started from a graphical
desktop on a GNU or Unix system, the standard error stream is commonly
redirected to a file such as <samp><span class="file">~/.xsession-errors</span></samp>, so you can
look for the crash report there.  On MS-Windows, the crash report is
written to a file named <samp><span class="file">emacs_backtrace.txt</span></samp> in the current
directory of the Emacs process, in addition to the standard error
stream.

   <p>The format of the crash report depends on the platform.  On some
platforms, such as those using the GNU C Library, the crash report
includes a <dfn>backtrace</dfn> describing the execution state prior to
crashing, which can be used to help debug the crash.  Here is an
example for a GNU system:

<pre class="example">     Fatal error 11: Segmentation fault
     Backtrace:
     emacs[0x5094e4]
     emacs[0x4ed3e6]
     emacs[0x4ed504]
     /lib64/libpthread.so.0[0x375220efe0]
     /lib64/libpthread.so.0(read+0xe)[0x375220e08e]
     emacs[0x509af6]
     emacs[0x5acc26]
     ...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The number `<samp><span class="samp">11</span></samp>' is the system signal number corresponding to the
crash&mdash;in this case a segmentation fault.  The hexadecimal numbers
are program addresses, which can be associated with source code lines
using a debugging tool.  For example, the GDB command
`<samp><span class="samp">list *0x509af6</span></samp>' prints the source-code lines corresponding to
the `<samp><span class="samp">emacs[0x509af6]</span></samp>' entry.  If your system has the
<samp><span class="command">addr2line</span></samp> utility, the following shell command outputs a
backtrace with source-code line numbers:

<pre class="example">     sed -n 's/.*\[\(.*\)]$/\1/p' <var>backtrace</var> |
       addr2line -C -f -i -p -e <var>bindir</var>/<var>emacs-binary</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here, <var>backtrace</var> is the name of a text file containing a copy of
the backtrace, <var>bindir</var> is the name of the directory that
contains the Emacs executable, and <var>emacs-binary</var> is the name of
the Emacs executable file, normally <samp><span class="file">emacs</span></samp> on GNU and Unix
systems and <samp><span class="file">emacs.exe</span></samp> on MS-Windows and MS-DOS.  Omit the
<samp><span class="option">-p</span></samp> option if your version of <samp><span class="command">addr2line</span></samp> is too old
to have it.

   <p><a name="index-core-dump-4790"></a>  Optionally, Emacs can generate a <dfn>core dump</dfn> when it crashes, on
systems that support core files.  A core dump is a file containing
voluminous data about the state of the program prior to the crash,
usually examined by loading it into a debugger such as GDB.  On many
platforms, core dumps are disabled by default, and you must explicitly
enable them by running the shell command `<samp><span class="samp">ulimit -c unlimited</span></samp>'
(e.g., in your shell startup script).

<h3 class="section">53.7 Recovery After a Crash</h3>

<p><a name="index-recovering-crashed-session-4791"></a>
  If Emacs or the computer crashes, you can recover the files you were
editing at the time of the crash from their auto-save files.  To do
this, start Emacs again and type the command <kbd>M-x recover-session</kbd>.

   <p>This command initially displays a buffer which lists interrupted
session files, each with its date.  You must choose which session to
recover from.  Typically the one you want is the most recent one.  Move
point to the one you choose, and type <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>.

   <p>Then <code>recover-session</code> considers each of the files that you
were editing during that session; for each such file, it asks whether
to recover that file.  If you answer <kbd>y</kbd> for a file, it shows the
dates of that file and its auto-save file, then asks once again
whether to recover that file.  For the second question, you must
confirm with <kbd>yes</kbd>.  If you do, Emacs visits the file but gets the
text from the auto-save file.

   <p>When <code>recover-session</code> is done, the files you've chosen to
recover are present in Emacs buffers.  You should then save them.  Only
this&mdash;saving them&mdash;updates the files themselves.

   <p>As a last resort, if you had buffers with content which were not
associated with any files, or if the autosave was not recent enough to
have recorded important changes, you can use the
<samp><span class="file">etc/emacs-buffer.gdb</span></samp> script with GDB (the GNU Debugger) to
retrieve them from a core dump&ndash;provided that a core dump was saved,
and that the Emacs executable was not stripped of its debugging
symbols.

   <p>As soon as you get the core dump, rename it to another name such as
<samp><span class="file">core.emacs</span></samp>, so that another crash won't overwrite it.

   <p>To use this script, run <code>gdb</code> with the file name of your Emacs
executable and the file name of the core dump, e.g., `<samp><span class="samp">gdb
/usr/bin/emacs core.emacs</span></samp>'.  At the <code>(gdb)</code> prompt, load the
recovery script: `<samp><span class="samp">source /usr/src/emacs/etc/emacs-buffer.gdb</span></samp>'. 
Then type the command <code>ybuffer-list</code> to see which buffers are
available.  For each buffer, it lists a buffer number.  To save a
buffer, use <code>ysave-buffer</code>; you specify the buffer number, and
the file name to write that buffer into.  You should use a file name
which does not already exist; if the file does exist, the script does
not make a backup of its old contents.

<h3 class="section">53.8 Emergency Escape</h3>

<p><a name="index-emergency-escape-4792"></a>
  On text terminals, the <dfn>emergency escape</dfn> feature suspends Emacs
immediately if you type <kbd>C-g</kbd> a second time before Emacs can
actually respond to the first one by quitting.  This is so you can
always get out of GNU Emacs no matter how badly it might be hung. 
When things are working properly, Emacs recognizes and handles the
first <kbd>C-g</kbd> so fast that the second one won't trigger emergency
escape.  However, if some problem prevents Emacs from handling the
first <kbd>C-g</kbd> properly, then the second one will get you back to the
shell.

   <p>When you resume Emacs after a suspension caused by emergency escape,
it asks two questions before going back to what it had been doing:

<pre class="example">     Auto-save? (y or n)
     Abort (and dump core)? (y or n)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Answer each one with <kbd>y</kbd> or <kbd>n</kbd> followed by &lt;RET&gt;.

   <p>Saying <kbd>y</kbd> to `<samp><span class="samp">Auto-save?</span></samp>' causes immediate auto-saving of
all modified buffers in which auto-saving is enabled.  Saying <kbd>n</kbd>
skips this.

   <p>Saying <kbd>y</kbd> to `<samp><span class="samp">Abort (and dump core)?</span></samp>' causes Emacs to
crash, dumping core.  This is to enable a wizard to figure out why
Emacs was failing to quit in the first place.  Execution does not
continue after a core dump.

   <p>If you answer this question <kbd>n</kbd>, Emacs execution resumes.  With
luck, Emacs will ultimately do the requested quit.  If not, each
subsequent <kbd>C-g</kbd> invokes emergency escape again.

   <p>If Emacs is not really hung, just slow, you may invoke the double
<kbd>C-g</kbd> feature without really meaning to.  Then just resume and
answer <kbd>n</kbd> to both questions, and you will get back to the former
state.  The quit you requested will happen by and by.

   <p>Emergency escape is active only for text terminals.  On graphical
displays, you can use the mouse to kill Emacs or switch to another
program.

   <p>On MS-DOS, you must type <kbd>C-&lt;Break&gt;</kbd> (twice) to cause
emergency escape&mdash;but there are cases where it won't work, when
system call hangs or when Emacs is stuck in a tight loop in C code.

<h3 class="section">54.1 Reading Existing Bug Reports and Known Problems</h3>

<p>Before reporting a bug, if at all possible please check to see if it
is already known about.  Indeed, it may already have been fixed in a
later release of Emacs, or in the development version.  Here is a list
of the main places you can read about known issues:

     <ul>
<li>The <samp><span class="file">etc/PROBLEMS</span></samp> file; type <kbd>C-h C-p</kbd> to read it.  This
file contains a list of particularly well-known issues that have been
encountered in compiling, installing and running Emacs.  Often, there
are suggestions for workarounds and solutions.

     <p><a name="index-bug-tracker-4794"></a><li>The GNU Bug Tracker at <a href="http://debbugs.gnu.org">http://debbugs.gnu.org</a>.  Emacs bugs are
filed in the tracker under the `<samp><span class="samp">emacs</span></samp>' package.  The tracker
records information about the status of each bug, the initial bug
report, and the follow-up messages by the bug reporter and Emacs
developers.  You can search for bugs by subject, severity, and other
criteria.

     <p><a name="index-debbugs-package-4795"></a>Instead of browsing the bug tracker as a webpage, you can browse it
from Emacs using the <code>debbugs</code> package, which can be downloaded
via the Package Menu (see <a href="#Packages">Packages</a>).  This package provides the
command <kbd>M-x debbugs-gnu</kbd> to list bugs, and <kbd>M-x
debbugs-gnu-search</kbd> to search for a specific bug.  User tags, applied
by the Emacs maintainers, are shown by <kbd>M-x debbugs-gnu-usertags</kbd>.

     <li>The `<samp><span class="samp">bug-gnu-emacs</span></samp>' mailing list (also available as the newsgroup
`<samp><span class="samp">gnu.emacs.bug</span></samp>').  You can read the list archives at
<a href="http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-gnu-emacs">http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-gnu-emacs</a>.  This list
works as a mirror of the Emacs bug reports and follow-up messages
which are sent to the bug tracker.  It also contains old bug reports
from before the bug tracker was introduced (in early 2008).

     <p>If you like, you can subscribe to the list.  Be aware that its purpose
is to provide the Emacs maintainers with information about bugs and
feature requests, so reports may contain fairly large amounts of data;
spectators should not complain about this.

     <li>The `<samp><span class="samp">emacs-pretest-bug</span></samp>' mailing list.  This list is no longer
used, and is mainly of historical interest.  At one time, it was used
for bug reports in development (i.e., not yet released) versions of
Emacs.  You can read the archives for 2003 to mid 2007 at
<a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-pretest-bug/">http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-pretest-bug/</a>.  Nowadays,
it is an alias for `<samp><span class="samp">bug-gnu-emacs</span></samp>'.

     <li>The `<samp><span class="samp">emacs-devel</span></samp>' mailing list.  Sometimes people report bugs to
this mailing list.  This is not the main purpose of the list, however,
and it is much better to send bug reports to the bug list.  You should
not feel obliged to read this list before reporting a bug.

<h3 class="section">54.2 When Is There a Bug</h3>

<p><a name="index-bug-criteria-4796"></a><a name="index-what-constitutes-an-Emacs-bug-4797"></a>
  If Emacs accesses an invalid memory location (a.k.a. 
&ldquo;segmentation fault&rdquo;) or exits with an operating system error
message that indicates a problem in the program (as opposed to
something like &ldquo;disk full&rdquo;), then it is certainly a bug.

   <p>If the Emacs display does not correspond properly to the contents of
the buffer, then it is a bug.  But you should check that features like
buffer narrowing (see <a href="#Narrowing">Narrowing</a>), which can hide parts of the
buffer or change how it is displayed, are not responsible.

   <p>Taking forever to complete a command can be a bug, but you must make
sure that it is really Emacs's fault.  Some commands simply take a
long time.  Type <kbd>C-g</kbd> (<kbd>C-&lt;Break&gt;</kbd> on MS-DOS) and then
<kbd>C-h l</kbd> to see whether the input Emacs received was what you
intended to type; if the input was such that you <em>know</em> it should
have been processed quickly, report a bug.  If you don't know whether
the command should take a long time, find out by looking in the manual
or by asking for assistance.

   <p>If a command you are familiar with causes an Emacs error message in a
case where its usual definition ought to be reasonable, it is probably a
bug.

   <p>If a command does the wrong thing, that is a bug.  But be sure you
know for certain what it ought to have done.  If you aren't familiar
with the command, it might actually be working right.  If in doubt,
read the command's documentation (see <a href="#Name-Help">Name Help</a>).

   <p>A command's intended definition may not be the best possible
definition for editing with.  This is a very important sort of
problem, but it is also a matter of judgment.  Also, it is easy to
come to such a conclusion out of ignorance of some of the existing
features.  It is probably best not to complain about such a problem
until you have checked the documentation in the usual ways, feel
confident that you understand it, and know for certain that what you
want is not available.  Ask other Emacs users, too.  If you are not
sure what the command is supposed to do after a careful reading of the
manual, check the index and glossary for any terms that may be
unclear.

   <p>If after careful rereading of the manual you still do not understand
what the command should do, that indicates a bug in the manual, which
you should report.  The manual's job is to make everything clear to
people who are not Emacs experts&mdash;including you.  It is just as
important to report documentation bugs as program bugs.

   <p>If the built-in documentation for a function or variable disagrees
with the manual, one of them must be wrong; that is a bug.

<h3 class="section">54.3 Understanding Bug Reporting</h3>

<p><a name="index-bug-reporting-4798"></a><a name="index-report-an-Emacs-bug_002c-how-to-4799"></a>
<a name="index-emacs_002dversion-4800"></a>  When you decide that there is a bug, it is important to report it
and to report it in a way which is useful.  What is most useful is an
exact description of what commands you type, starting with the shell
command to run Emacs, until the problem happens.

   <p>The most important principle in reporting a bug is to report
<em>facts</em>.  Hypotheses and verbal descriptions are no substitute
for the detailed raw data.  Reporting the facts is straightforward,
but many people strain to posit explanations and report them instead
of the facts.  If the explanations are based on guesses about how
Emacs is implemented, they will be useless; meanwhile, lacking the
facts, we will have no real information about the bug.  If you want to
actually <em>debug</em> the problem, and report explanations that are
more than guesses, that is useful&mdash;but please include the raw facts
as well.

   <p>For example, suppose that you type <kbd>C-x C-f /glorp/baz.ugh
&lt;RET&gt;</kbd>, visiting a file which (you know) happens to be rather
large, and Emacs displays `<samp><span class="samp">I feel pretty today</span></samp>'.  The bug report
would need to provide all that information.  You should not assume
that the problem is due to the size of the file and say, &ldquo;I visited a
large file, and Emacs displayed `<samp><span class="samp">I feel pretty today</span></samp>'.&rdquo;  This is
what we mean by &ldquo;guessing explanations&rdquo;.  The problem might be due
to the fact that there is a `<samp><span class="samp">z</span></samp>' in the file name.  If this is so,
then when we got your report, we would try out the problem with some
large file, probably with no `<samp><span class="samp">z</span></samp>' in its name, and not see any
problem.  There is no way we could guess that we should try visiting a
file with a `<samp><span class="samp">z</span></samp>' in its name.

   <p>You should not even say &ldquo;visit a file&rdquo; instead of <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>. 
Similarly, rather than saying &ldquo;if I have three characters on the
line&rdquo;, say &ldquo;after I type <kbd>&lt;RET&gt; A B C &lt;RET&gt; C-p</kbd>&rdquo;, if
that is the way you entered the text.

   <p>If possible, try quickly to reproduce the bug by invoking Emacs with
<samp><span class="command">emacs -Q</span></samp> (so that Emacs starts with no initial
customizations; see <a href="#Initial-Options">Initial Options</a>), and repeating the steps that
you took to trigger the bug.  If you can reproduce the bug this way,
that rules out bugs in your personal customizations.  Then your bug
report should begin by stating that you started Emacs with
<samp><span class="command">emacs -Q</span></samp>, followed by the exact sequence of steps for
reproducing the bug.  If possible, inform us of the exact contents of
any file that is needed to reproduce the bug.

   <p>Some bugs are not reproducible from <samp><span class="command">emacs -Q</span></samp>; some are not
easily reproducible at all.  In that case, you should report what you
have&mdash;but, as before, please stick to the raw facts about what you
did to trigger the bug the first time.

   <p>If you have multiple issues that you want to report, please make a
separate bug report for each.

<h3 class="section">54.4 Checklist for Bug Reports</h3>

<p><a name="index-checklist-before-reporting-a-bug-4801"></a><a name="index-bug-reporting_002c-checklist-4802"></a>
  Before reporting a bug, first try to see if the problem has already
been reported (see <a href="#Known-Problems">Known Problems</a>).

   <p>If you are able to, try the latest release of Emacs to see if the
problem has already been fixed.  Even better is to try the latest
development version.  We recognize that this is not easy for some
people, so do not feel that you absolutely must do this before making
a report.

   <p><a name="index-report_002demacs_002dbug-4803"></a>  The best way to write a bug report for Emacs is to use the command
<kbd>M-x report-emacs-bug</kbd>.  This sets up a mail buffer
(see <a href="#Sending-Mail">Sending Mail</a>) and automatically inserts <em>some</em> of the
essential information.  However, it cannot supply all the necessary
information; you should still read and follow the guidelines below, so
you can enter the other crucial information by hand before you send
the message.  You may feel that some of the information inserted by
<kbd>M-x report-emacs-bug</kbd> is not relevant, but unless you are
absolutely sure it is best to leave it, so that the developers can
decide for themselves.

   <p>When you have finished writing your report, type <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> and it
will be sent to the Emacs maintainers at
<a href="http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-gnu-emacs">bug-gnu-emacs</a>. 
(If you want to suggest an improvement or new feature, use the same
address.)  If you cannot send mail from inside Emacs, you can copy the
text of your report to your normal mail client (if your system
supports it, you can type <kbd>C-c M-i</kbd> to have Emacs do this for you)
and send it to that address.  Or you can simply send an email to that
address describing the problem.

   <p>Your report will be sent to the `<samp><span class="samp">bug-gnu-emacs</span></samp>' mailing list, and
stored in the GNU Bug Tracker at <a href="http://debbugs.gnu.org">http://debbugs.gnu.org</a>.  Please
include a valid reply email address, in case we need to ask you for
more information about your report.  Submissions are moderated, so
there may be a delay before your report appears.

   <p>You do not need to know how the Gnu Bug Tracker works in order to
report a bug, but if you want to, you can read the tracker's online
documentation to see the various features you can use.

   <p>All mail sent to the `<samp><span class="samp">bug-gnu-emacs</span></samp>' mailing list is also
gatewayed to the `<samp><span class="samp">gnu.emacs.bug</span></samp>' newsgroup.  The reverse is also
true, but we ask you not to post bug reports (or replies) via the
newsgroup.  It can make it much harder to contact you if we need to ask
for more information, and it does not integrate well with the bug
tracker.

   <p>If your data is more than 500,000 bytes, please don't include it
directly in the bug report; instead, offer to send it on request, or
make it available by ftp and say where.

   <p>To enable maintainers to investigate a bug, your report
should include all these things:

     <ul>
<li>The version number of Emacs.  Without this, we won't know whether there is any
point in looking for the bug in the current version of GNU Emacs.

     <p><kbd>M-x report-emacs-bug</kbd> includes this information automatically,
but if you are not using that command for your report you can get the
version number by typing <kbd>M-x emacs-version &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.  If that
command does not work, you probably have something other than GNU
Emacs, so you will have to report the bug somewhere else.

     <li>The type of machine you are using, and the operating system name and
version number (again, automatically included by <kbd>M-x
report-emacs-bug</kbd>).  <kbd>M-x emacs-version &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> provides this
information too.  Copy its output from the <samp><span class="file">*Messages*</span></samp> buffer,
so that you get it all and get it accurately.

     <li>The operands given to the <code>configure</code> command when Emacs was
installed (automatically included by <kbd>M-x report-emacs-bug</kbd>).

     <li>A complete list of any modifications you have made to the Emacs source. 
(We may not have time to investigate the bug unless it happens in an
unmodified Emacs.  But if you've made modifications and you don't tell
us, you are sending us on a wild goose chase.)

     <p>Be precise about these changes.  A description in English is not
enough&mdash;send a unified context diff for them.

     <p>Adding files of your own, or porting to another machine, is a
modification of the source.

     <li>Details of any other deviations from the standard procedure for installing
GNU Emacs.

     <li>The complete text of any files needed to reproduce the bug.

     <p>If you can tell us a way to cause the problem without visiting any files,
please do so.  This makes it much easier to debug.  If you do need files,
make sure you arrange for us to see their exact contents.  For example, it
can matter whether there are spaces at the ends of lines, or a
newline after the last line in the buffer (nothing ought to care whether
the last line is terminated, but try telling the bugs that).

     <li>The precise commands we need to type to reproduce the bug.  If at all
possible, give a full recipe for an Emacs started with the `<samp><span class="samp">-Q</span></samp>'
option (see <a href="#Initial-Options">Initial Options</a>).  This bypasses your personal
customizations.

     <p><a name="index-open_002ddribble_002dfile-4804"></a><a name="index-dribble-file-4805"></a><a name="index-logging-keystrokes-4806"></a>One way to record the input to Emacs precisely is to write a dribble
file.  To start the file, use the <kbd>M-x open-dribble-file
&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> command.  From then on, Emacs copies all your input to the
specified dribble file until the Emacs process is killed.  Be aware
that sensitive information (such as passwords) may end up recorded in
the dribble file.

     <li><a name="index-open_002dtermscript-4807"></a><a name="index-termscript-file-4808"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040env_007bTERM_007d-environment-variable-4809"></a>For possible display bugs, the terminal type (the value of environment
variable <samp><span class="env">TERM</span></samp>), the complete termcap entry for the terminal from
<samp><span class="file">/etc/termcap</span></samp> (since that file is not identical on all machines),
and the output that Emacs actually sent to the terminal.

     <p>The way to collect the terminal output is to execute the Lisp expression

     <pre class="example">          (open-termscript "~/termscript")
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">using <kbd>M-:</kbd> or from the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer just after
starting Emacs.  From then on, Emacs copies all terminal output to the
specified termscript file as well, until the Emacs process is killed. 
If the problem happens when Emacs starts up, put this expression into
your Emacs initialization file so that the termscript file will be
open when Emacs displays the screen for the first time.

     <p>Be warned: it is often difficult, and sometimes impossible, to fix a
terminal-dependent bug without access to a terminal of the type that
stimulates the bug.

     <li>If non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> text or internationalization is relevant, the locale that
was current when you started Emacs.  On GNU/Linux and Unix systems, or
if you use a Posix-style shell such as Bash, you can use this shell
command to view the relevant values:

     <pre class="smallexample">          echo LC_ALL=$LC_ALL LC_COLLATE=$LC_COLLATE LC_CTYPE=$LC_CTYPE \
            LC_MESSAGES=$LC_MESSAGES LC_TIME=$LC_TIME LANG=$LANG
     </pre>
     <p>Alternatively, use the <samp><span class="command">locale</span></samp> command, if your system has it,
to display your locale settings.

     <p>You can use the <kbd>M-!</kbd> command to execute these commands from
Emacs, and then copy the output from the <samp><span class="file">*Messages*</span></samp> buffer into
the bug report.  Alternatively, <kbd>M-x getenv &lt;RET&gt; LC_ALL
&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> will display the value of <code>LC_ALL</code> in the echo area, and
you can copy its output from the <samp><span class="file">*Messages*</span></samp> buffer.

     <li>A description of what behavior you observe that you believe is
incorrect.  For example, &ldquo;The Emacs process gets a fatal signal&rdquo;, or,
&ldquo;The resulting text is as follows, which I think is wrong.&rdquo;

     <p>Of course, if the bug is that Emacs gets a fatal signal, then one can't
miss it.  But if the bug is incorrect text, the maintainer might fail to
notice what is wrong.  Why leave it to chance?

     <p>Even if the problem you experience is a fatal signal, you should still
say so explicitly.  Suppose something strange is going on, such as, your
copy of the source is out of sync, or you have encountered a bug in the
C library on your system.  (This has happened!)  Your copy might crash
and the copy here might not.  If you <em>said</em> to expect a crash, then
when Emacs here fails to crash, we would know that the bug was not
happening.  If you don't say to expect a crash, then we would not know
whether the bug was happening&mdash;we would not be able to draw any
conclusion from our observations.

     <li>If the bug is that the Emacs Manual or the Emacs Lisp Reference Manual
fails to describe the actual behavior of Emacs, or that the text is
confusing, copy in the text from the manual which you think is
at fault.  If the section is small, just the section name is enough.

     <li>If the manifestation of the bug is an Emacs error message, it is
important to report the precise text of the error message, and a
backtrace showing how the Lisp program in Emacs arrived at the error.

     <p>To get the error message text accurately, copy it from the
<samp><span class="file">*Messages*</span></samp> buffer into the bug report.  Copy all of it, not just
part.

     <p><a name="index-toggle_002ddebug_002don_002derror-4810"></a><a name="index-Edebug-4811"></a>To make a backtrace for the error, use <kbd>M-x toggle-debug-on-error</kbd>
before the error happens (that is to say, you must give that command
and then make the bug happen).  This causes the error to start the Lisp
debugger, which shows you a backtrace.  Copy the text of the
debugger's backtrace into the bug report.  See <a href="elisp.html#Edebug">Edebug</a>, for information on debugging
Emacs Lisp programs with the Edebug package.

     <p>This use of the debugger is possible only if you know how to make the
bug happen again.  If you can't make it happen again, at least copy
the whole error message.

     <p><a name="index-debug_002don_002dquit-4812"></a>If Emacs appears to be stuck in an infinite loop or in a very long
operation, typing <kbd>C-g</kbd> with the variable <code>debug-on-quit</code>
non-<code>nil</code> will start the Lisp debugger and show a backtrace. 
This backtrace is useful for debugging such long loops, so if you can
produce it, copy it into the bug report.

     <p><a name="index-debug_002don_002devent-4813"></a>If you cannot get Emacs to respond to <kbd>C-g</kbd> (e.g., because
<code>inhibit-quit</code> is set), then you can try sending the signal
specified by <code>debug-on-event</code> (default SIGUSR2) from outside
Emacs to cause it to enter the debugger.

     <li>Check whether any programs you have loaded into the Lisp world,
including your initialization file, set any variables that may affect
the functioning of Emacs.  Also, see whether the problem happens in a
freshly started Emacs without loading your initialization file (start
Emacs with the <code>-Q</code> switch to prevent loading the init files). 
If the problem does <em>not</em> occur then, you must report the precise
contents of any programs that you must load into the Lisp world in
order to cause the problem to occur.

     <li>If the problem does depend on an init file or other Lisp programs that
are not part of the standard Emacs system, then you should make sure it
is not a bug in those programs by complaining to their maintainers
first.  After they verify that they are using Emacs in a way that is
supposed to work, they should report the bug.

     <li>If you wish to mention something in the GNU Emacs source, show the line
of code with a few lines of context.  Don't just give a line number.

     <p>The line numbers in the development sources don't match those in your
sources.  It would take extra work for the maintainers to determine what
code is in your version at a given line number, and we could not be
certain.

     <li>Additional information from a C debugger such as GDB might enable
someone to find a problem on a machine which he does not have available. 
If you don't know how to use GDB, please read the GDB manual&mdash;it is not
very long, and using GDB is easy.  You can find the GDB distribution,
including the GDB manual in online form, in most of the same places you
can find the Emacs distribution.  To run Emacs under GDB, you should
switch to the <samp><span class="file">src</span></samp> subdirectory in which Emacs was compiled, then
do `<samp><span class="samp">gdb emacs</span></samp>'.  It is important for the directory <samp><span class="file">src</span></samp> to be
current so that GDB will read the <samp><span class="file">.gdbinit</span></samp> file in this
directory.

     <p>However, you need to think when you collect the additional information
if you want it to show what causes the bug.

     <p><a name="index-backtrace-for-bug-reports-4814"></a>For example, many people send just a backtrace, but that is not very
useful by itself.  A simple backtrace with arguments often conveys
little about what is happening inside GNU Emacs, because most of the
arguments listed in the backtrace are pointers to Lisp objects.  The
numeric values of these pointers have no significance whatever; all that
matters is the contents of the objects they point to (and most of the
contents are themselves pointers).

     <p><a name="index-debug_005fprint-4815"></a>To provide useful information, you need to show the values of Lisp
objects in Lisp notation.  Do this for each variable which is a Lisp
object, in several stack frames near the bottom of the stack.  Look at
the source to see which variables are Lisp objects, because the debugger
thinks of them as integers.

     <p>To show a variable's value in Lisp syntax, first print its value, then
use the user-defined GDB command <code>pr</code> to print the Lisp object in
Lisp syntax.  (If you must use another debugger, call the function
<code>debug_print</code> with the object as an argument.)  The <code>pr</code>
command is defined by the file <samp><span class="file">.gdbinit</span></samp>, and it works only if you
are debugging a running process (not with a core dump).

     <p>To make Lisp errors stop Emacs and return to GDB, put a breakpoint at
<code>Fsignal</code>.

     <p>For a short listing of Lisp functions running, type the GDB
command <code>xbacktrace</code>.

     <p>The file <samp><span class="file">.gdbinit</span></samp> defines several other commands that are useful
for examining the data types and contents of Lisp objects.  Their names
begin with `<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>'.  These commands work at a lower level than
<code>pr</code>, and are less convenient, but they may work even when
<code>pr</code> does not, such as when debugging a core dump or when Emacs has
had a fatal signal.

     <p><a name="index-debugging-Emacs_002c-tricks-and-techniques-4816"></a>More detailed advice and other useful techniques for debugging Emacs
are available in the file <samp><span class="file">etc/DEBUG</span></samp> in the Emacs distribution. 
That file also includes instructions for investigating problems
whereby Emacs stops responding (many people assume that Emacs is
&ldquo;hung&rdquo;, whereas in fact it might be in an infinite loop).

     <p>To find the file <samp><span class="file">etc/DEBUG</span></samp> in your Emacs installation, use the
directory name stored in the variable <code>data-directory</code>. 
</ul>

   <p>Here are some things that are not necessary in a bug report:

     <ul>
<li>A description of the envelope of the bug&mdash;this is not necessary for a
reproducible bug.

     <p>Often people who encounter a bug spend a lot of time investigating
which changes to the input file will make the bug go away and which
changes will not affect it.

     <p>This is often time-consuming and not very useful, because the way we
will find the bug is by running a single example under the debugger
with breakpoints, not by pure deduction from a series of examples. 
You might as well save time by not searching for additional examples. 
It is better to send the bug report right away, go back to editing,
and find another bug to report.

     <p>Of course, if you can find a simpler example to report <em>instead</em> of
the original one, that is a convenience.  Errors in the output will be
easier to spot, running under the debugger will take less time, etc.

     <p>However, simplification is not vital; if you can't do this or don't have
time to try, please report the bug with your original test case.

     <li>A core dump file.

     <p>Debugging the core dump might be useful, but it can only be done on
your machine, with your Emacs executable.  Therefore, sending the core
dump file to the Emacs maintainers won't be useful.  Above all, don't
include the core file in an email bug report!  Such a large message
can be extremely inconvenient.

     <li>A system-call trace of Emacs execution.

     <p>System-call traces are very useful for certain special kinds of
debugging, but in most cases they give little useful information.  It is
therefore strange that many people seem to think that <em>the</em> way to
report information about a crash is to send a system-call trace.  Perhaps
this is a habit formed from experience debugging programs that don't
have source code or debugging symbols.

     <p>In most programs, a backtrace is normally far, far more informative than
a system-call trace.  Even in Emacs, a simple backtrace is generally
more informative, though to give full information you should supplement
the backtrace by displaying variable values and printing them as Lisp
objects with <code>pr</code> (see above).

     <li>A patch for the bug.

     <p>A patch for the bug is useful if it is a good one.  But don't omit the
other information that a bug report needs, such as the test case, on the
assumption that a patch is sufficient.  We might see problems with your
patch and decide to fix the problem another way, or we might not
understand it at all.  And if we can't understand what bug you are
trying to fix, or why your patch should be an improvement, we mustn't
install it.

     <p>See <a href="#Sending-Patches">Sending Patches</a>, for guidelines on how to make it easy for us to
understand and install your patches.

     <li>A guess about what the bug is or what it depends on.

     <p>Such guesses are usually wrong.  Even experts can't guess right about
such things without first using the debugger to find the facts.

<h3 class="section">54.5 Sending Patches for GNU Emacs</h3>

<p><a name="index-sending-patches-for-GNU-Emacs-4817"></a><a name="index-patches_002c-sending-4818"></a>  If you would like to write bug fixes or improvements for GNU Emacs,
that is very helpful.  When you send your changes, please follow these
guidelines to make it easy for the maintainers to use them.  If you
don't follow these guidelines, your information might still be useful,
but using it will take extra work.  Maintaining GNU Emacs is a lot of
work in the best of circumstances, and we can't keep up unless you do
your best to help.

   <p>Every patch must have several pieces of information before we
can properly evaluate it.

   <p>When you have all these pieces, bundle them up in a mail message and
send it to the developers.  Sending it to
<a href="mailto:bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org">bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org</a> (which is the bug/feature list) is
recommended, because that list is coupled to a tracking system that
makes it easier to locate patches.  If your patch is not complete and
you think it needs more discussion, you might want to send it to
<a href="mailto:emacs-devel@gnu.org">emacs-devel@gnu.org</a> instead.  If you revise your patch,
send it as a followup to the initial topic.

   <p>We prefer to get the patches as plain text, either inline (be careful
your mail client does not change line breaks) or as MIME attachments.

     <ul>
<li>Include an explanation with your changes of what problem they fix or what
improvement they bring about.

          <ul>
<li>For a fix for an existing bug, it is
best to reply to the relevant discussion on the `<samp><span class="samp">bug-gnu-emacs</span></samp>'
list, or the bug entry in the GNU Bug Tracker at
<a href="http://debbugs.gnu.org">http://debbugs.gnu.org</a>.  Explain why your change fixes the bug.

          <li>For a new feature, include a description of the feature and your
implementation.

          <li>For a new bug, include a proper bug report for the problem you think
you have fixed.  We need to convince ourselves that the change is
right before installing it.  Even if it is correct, we might have
trouble understanding it if we don't have a way to reproduce the
problem. 
</ul>

     <li>Include all the comments that are appropriate to help people reading the
source in the future understand why this change was needed.

     <li>Don't mix together changes made for different reasons. 
Send them <em>individually</em>.

     <p>If you make two changes for separate reasons, then we might not want to
install them both.  We might want to install just one.  If you send them
all jumbled together in a single set of diffs, we have to do extra work
to disentangle them&mdash;to figure out which parts of the change serve
which purpose.  If we don't have time for this, we might have to ignore
your changes entirely.

     <p>If you send each change as soon as you have written it, with its own
explanation, then two changes never get tangled up, and we can consider
each one properly without any extra work to disentangle them.

     <li>Send each change as soon as that change is finished.  Sometimes people
think they are helping us by accumulating many changes to send them all
together.  As explained above, this is absolutely the worst thing you
could do.

     <p>Since you should send each change separately, you might as well send it
right away.  That gives us the option of installing it immediately if it
is important.

     <li>The patch itself.

     <p>Use `<samp><span class="samp">diff -u</span></samp>' to make your diffs.  Diffs without context are hard
to install reliably.  More than that, they are hard to study; we must
always study a patch to decide whether we want to install it.  Context
format is better than contextless diffs, but we prefer the unified
format.

     <p>If you have GNU diff, use `<samp><span class="samp">diff -u -F'^[_a-zA-Z0-9$]\+ *('</span></samp>' when
making diffs of C code.  This shows the name of the function that each
change occurs in.

     <p>If you are using the Emacs repository, make sure your copy is
up-to-date (e.g., with <code>git pull</code>).  You can commit your changes
to a private branch and generate a patch from the master version by
using <code>git format-patch master</code>. Or you can leave your changes
uncommitted and use <code>git diff</code>.

     <li>Avoid any ambiguity as to which is the old version and which is the new. 
Please make the old version the first argument to diff, and the new
version the second argument.  And please give one version or the other a
name that indicates whether it is the old version or your new changed
one.

     <li>Write the change log entries for your changes.  This is both to save us
the extra work of writing them, and to help explain your changes so we
can understand them.

     <p>The purpose of the change log is to show people where to find what was
changed.  So you need to be specific about what functions you changed;
in large functions, it's often helpful to indicate where within the
function the change was.

     <p>On the other hand, once you have shown people where to find the change,
you need not explain its purpose in the change log.  Thus, if you add a
new function, all you need to say about it is that it is new.  If you
feel that the purpose needs explaining, it probably does&mdash;but put the
explanation in comments in the code.  It will be more useful there.

     <p>Please look at the change log entries of recent commits to see what
sorts of information to put in, and to learn the style that we use.  Note that,
unlike some other projects, we do require change logs for
documentation, i.e., Texinfo files. 
See <a href="#Change-Log">Change Log</a>,
See <a href="standards.html#Change-Log-Concepts">Change Log Concepts</a>.

     <li>When you write the fix, keep in mind that we can't install a change that
would break other systems.  Please think about what effect your change
will have if compiled on another type of system.

     <p>Sometimes people send fixes that <em>might</em> be an improvement in
general&mdash;but it is hard to be sure of this.  It's hard to install
such changes because we have to study them very carefully.  Of course,
a good explanation of the reasoning by which you concluded the change
was correct can help convince us.

     <p>The safest changes are changes to the configuration files for a
particular machine.  These are safe because they can't create new bugs
on other machines.

     <p>Please help us keep up with the workload by designing the patch in a
form that is clearly safe to install.

<h2 class="chapter">55 Contributing to Emacs Development</h2>

<p><a name="index-contributing-to-Emacs-4819"></a>
Emacs is a collaborative project and we encourage contributions from
anyone and everyone.

   <p>There are many ways to contribute to Emacs:

     <ul>
<li>find and report bugs; See <a href="#Bugs">Bugs</a>.

     <li>answer questions on the Emacs user mailing list
<a href="https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/help-gnu-emacs">https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/help-gnu-emacs</a>.

     <li>write documentation, either on the wiki, or in the Emacs source
repository (see <a href="#Sending-Patches">Sending Patches</a>).

     <li>check if existing bug reports are fixed in newer versions of Emacs
<a href="http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/pkgreport.cgi?which=pkg&amp;data=emacs">http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/pkgreport.cgi?which=pkg&amp;data=emacs</a>.

     <li>fix existing bug reports
<a href="http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/pkgreport.cgi?which=pkg&amp;data=emacs">http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/pkgreport.cgi?which=pkg&amp;data=emacs</a>.

     <li><!-- etc/TODO not in WWW_GNU_ORG -->
implement a feature listed in the <samp><span class="file">etc/TODO</span></samp> file in the Emacs
distribution, and submit a patch.

     <li>implement a new feature, and submit a patch.

     <li>develop a package that works with Emacs, and publish it on your own
or in Gnu ELPA (<a href="https://elpa.gnu.org/">https://elpa.gnu.org/</a>).

     <li>port Emacs to a new platform, but that is not common nowadays.

   </ul>

   <p>If you would like to work on improving Emacs, please contact the maintainers at
<a href="http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/emacs-devel">the emacs-devel mailing list</a>. 
You can ask for suggested projects or suggest your own ideas.

   <p>If you have already written an improvement, please tell us about it.  If
you have not yet started work, it is useful to contact
<a href="http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/emacs-devel">emacs-devel</a>
before you start; it might be possible to suggest ways to make your
extension fit in better with the rest of Emacs.

   <p>When implementing a feature, please follow the Emacs coding standards;
See <a href="#Coding-Standards">Coding Standards</a>. In addition, non-trivial contributions
require a copyright assignment to the FSF; See <a href="#Copyright-Assignment">Copyright Assignment</a>.

   <p>The development version of Emacs can be downloaded from the
repository where it is actively maintained by a group of developers. 
See the Emacs project page
<a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/emacs/">http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/emacs/</a> for access details.

   <p>It is important to write your patch based on the current working
version.  If you start from an older version, your patch may be
outdated (so that maintainers will have a hard time applying it), or
changes in Emacs may have made your patch unnecessary.  After you have
downloaded the repository source, you should read the file
<samp><span class="file">INSTALL.REPO</span></samp> for build instructions (they differ to some extent
from a normal build).

   <p>If you would like to make more extensive contributions, see the
<samp><span class="file">./CONTRIBUTE</span></samp> file in the Emacs distribution for information on
how to be an Emacs developer.

   <p>For documentation on Emacs (to understand how to implement your
desired change), refer to:

Contributed code should follow the GNU Coding Standards
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/">http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/</a>. This may also be available
in info on your system.

   <p>If it doesn't, we'll need to find someone to fix the code before we
can use it.

   <p>Emacs has additional style and coding conventions:

     <ul>
<li>See <a href="elisp.html#Tips">&ldquo;Tips and Conventions&rdquo; Appendix in the Emacs Lisp Reference</a>.

     <li>Avoid using <code>defadvice</code> or <code>with-eval-after-load</code> for Lisp code
to be included in Emacs.

     <li>Remove all trailing whitespace in all source and text files.

     <li>Emacs has no convention on whether to use tabs in source code; please
don't change whitespace in the files you edit.

     <li>Use <code>?\s</code> instead of <code>? </code> in Lisp code for a space character.

<h3 class="section">55.2 Copyright Assignment</h3>

<p><a name="index-copyright-assignment-4821"></a>
The FSF (Free Software Foundation) is the copyright holder for GNU Emacs. 
The FSF is a nonprofit with a worldwide mission to promote computer
user freedom and to defend the rights of all free software users. 
For general information, see the website <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">http://www.fsf.org/</a>.

   <p>Generally speaking, for non-trivial contributions to GNU Emacs we
require that the copyright be assigned to the FSF.  For the reasons
behind this, see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-assign.html">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-assign.html</a>.

   <p>Copyright assignment is a simple process.  Residents of some countries
can do it entirely electronically.  We can help you get started, and
answer any questions you may have (or point you to the people with the
answers), at the <a href="mailto:emacs-devel@gnu.org">emacs-devel@gnu.org</a> mailing list.

   <p>(Please note: general discussion about why some GNU projects ask
for a copyright assignment is off-topic for emacs-devel. 
See gnu-misc-discuss instead.)

   <p>A copyright disclaimer is also a possibility, but we prefer an assignment. 
Note that the disclaimer, like an assignment, involves you sending
signed paperwork to the FSF (simply saying &ldquo;this is in the public domain&rdquo;
is not enough).  Also, a disclaimer cannot be applied to future work, it
has to be repeated each time you want to send something new.

   <p>We can accept small changes (roughly, fewer than 15 lines) without
an assignment.  This is a cumulative limit (e.g., three separate 5 line
patches) over all your contributions.

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix A GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</h2>

<!-- The GNU General Public License. -->
<div align="center">Version 3, 29 June 2007</div>

<!-- This file is intended to be included within another document, -->
<!-- hence no sectioning command or @node. -->
<pre class="display">     Copyright &copy; 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <a href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a>
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
     license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>
   <h3 class="heading">Preamble</h3>

<p>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

   <p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom
to share and change all versions of a program&mdash;to make sure it remains
free software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation,
use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it
applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.  You
can apply it to your programs, too.

   <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

   <p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you
have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom
of others.

   <p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too,
receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these
terms so they know their rights.

   <p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

   <p>For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

   <p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the
manufacturer can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the
aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The
systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for
individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. 
Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the
practice for those products.  If such problems arise substantially in
other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those
domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the
freedom of users.

   <p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. 
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish
to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program
could make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL
assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

   <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

<h3 class="heading">TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>

     <ol type=1 start=0>
<li>Definitions.

     <p>&ldquo;This License&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

     <p>&ldquo;Copyright&rdquo; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
of works, such as semiconductor masks.

     <p>&ldquo;The Program&rdquo; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Licensees&rdquo; and
&ldquo;recipients&rdquo; may be individuals or organizations.

     <p>To &ldquo;modify&rdquo; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of
an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &ldquo;modified version&rdquo; of
the earlier work or a work &ldquo;based on&rdquo; the earlier work.

     <p>A &ldquo;covered work&rdquo; means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

     <p>To &ldquo;propagate&rdquo; a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

     <p>To &ldquo;convey&rdquo; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user
through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
conveying.

     <p>An interactive user interface displays &ldquo;Appropriate Legal Notices&rdquo; to
the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

     <li>Source Code.

     <p>The &ldquo;source code&rdquo; for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  &ldquo;Object code&rdquo; means any non-source form
of a work.

     <p>A &ldquo;Standard Interface&rdquo; means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

     <p>The &ldquo;System Libraries&rdquo; of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
&ldquo;Major Component&rdquo;, in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

     <p>The &ldquo;Corresponding Source&rdquo; for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

     <p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

     <p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same
work.

     <li>Basic Permissions.

     <p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

     <p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. 
You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having
them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with
facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the
terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not
control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for
you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and
control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your
copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

     <p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

     <li>Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

     <p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

     <p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such
circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with
respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit
operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against
the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid
circumvention of technological measures.

     <li>Conveying Verbatim Copies.

     <p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

     <p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

     <li>Conveying Modified Source Versions.

     <p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
conditions:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,
and giving a relevant date.

          <li>The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
under this License and any conditions added under section 7.  This
requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to &ldquo;keep intact all
notices&rdquo;.

          <li>You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This License will
therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms,
to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they
are packaged.  This License gives no permission to license the work in
any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have
separately received it.

          <li>If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work
need not make them do so.
          </ol>

     <p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
&ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

     <li>Conveying Non-Source Forms.

     <p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these
ways:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily
used for software interchange.

          <li>Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written
offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you
offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give
anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the
Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is
covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used
for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable
cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access
to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

          <li>Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written
offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This alternative is
allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you
received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection
6b.

          <li>Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
(gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to copy
the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be
on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports
equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions
next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. 
Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain
obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to
satisfy these requirements.

          <li>Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you
inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of
the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under
subsection 6d.

          </ol>

     <p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

     <p>A &ldquo;User Product&rdquo; is either (1) a &ldquo;consumer product&rdquo;, which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a
consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of
coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user,
&ldquo;normally used&rdquo; refers to a typical or common use of that class of
product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way
in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected
to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of
whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or
non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant
mode of use of the product.

     <p>&ldquo;Installation Information&rdquo; for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to
install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User
Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The
information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of
the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with
solely because modification has been made.

     <p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

     <p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or
updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the
recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or
installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the modification
itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network
or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the
network.

     <p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

     <li>Additional Terms.

     <p>&ldquo;Additional permissions&rdquo; are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. 
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

     <p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

     <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders
of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms
of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

          <li>Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author
attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices
displayed by works containing it; or

          <li>Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

          <li>Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
authors of the material; or

          <li>Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade
names, trademarks, or service marks; or

          <li>Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by
anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with
contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any
liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those
licensors and authors.
          </ol>

     <p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &ldquo;further
restrictions&rdquo; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

     <p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

     <p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the
above requirements apply either way.

     <li>Termination.

     <p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

     <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

     <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

     <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

     <li>Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

     <p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run
a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

     <li>Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

     <p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

     <p>An &ldquo;entity transaction&rdquo; is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

     <p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

     <li>Patents.

     <p>A &ldquo;contributor&rdquo; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's &ldquo;contributor version&rdquo;.

     <p>A contributor's &ldquo;essential patent claims&rdquo; are all patent claims owned
or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, &ldquo;control&rdquo; includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

     <p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

     <p>In the following three paragraphs, a &ldquo;patent license&rdquo; is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To &ldquo;grant&rdquo; such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

     <p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  &ldquo;Knowingly relying&rdquo; means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

     <p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

     <p>A patent license is &ldquo;discriminatory&rdquo; if it does not include within the
scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on
the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically
granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you
are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the
business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the
third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the
work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties
who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent
license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by
you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in
connection with specific products or compilations that contain the
covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent
license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

     <p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

     <li>No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

     <p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey
a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree
to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying
from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could
satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely
from conveying the Program.

     <li>Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

     <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

     <li>Revised Versions of this License.

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or
of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If
the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General
Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
Software Foundation.

     <p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions
of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public
statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to
choose that version for the Program.

     <p>Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

     <li>Disclaimer of Warranty.

     <p>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.

     <li>Limitation of Liability.

     <p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM
TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

     <li>Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

     <p>If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

     </ol>

<h3 class="heading">END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>

<h3 class="heading">How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h3>

<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   <p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the &ldquo;copyright&rdquo; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<pre class="smallexample">     <var>one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.</var>
     Copyright (C) <var>year</var> <var>name of author</var>
     
     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at
     your option) any later version.
     
     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     General Public License for more details.
     
     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program.  If not, see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a>.
</pre>
   <p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

   <p>If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

<pre class="smallexample">     <var>program</var> Copyright (C) <var>year</var> <var>name of author</var>
     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `<samp><span class="samp">show w</span></samp>'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type `<samp><span class="samp">show c</span></samp>' for details.
</pre>
   <p>The hypothetical commands `<samp><span class="samp">show w</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">show c</span></samp>' should show
the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your
program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would
use an &ldquo;about box&rdquo;.

   <p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a &ldquo;copyright disclaimer&rdquo; for the program, if necessary. 
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a>.

   <p>The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But
first, please read <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html</a>.

<div align="center">Version 1.3, 3 November 2008</div>

<!-- This file is intended to be included within another document, -->
<!-- hence no sectioning command or @node. -->
<pre class="display">     Copyright &copy; 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <a href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a>
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>
     <ol type=1 start=0>
<li>PREAMBLE

     <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <dfn>free</dfn> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. 
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

     <p>This License is a kind of &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

     <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

     <li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     <p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The &ldquo;Document&rdquo;, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

     <p>A &ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

     <p>A &ldquo;Secondary Section&rdquo; is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

     <p>The &ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

     <p>The &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

     <p>A &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. 
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.

     <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, SGML or XML using a publicly available
DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and
JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

     <p>The &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     <p>The &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.

     <p>A section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;.)  To &ldquo;Preserve the Title&rdquo;
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; according to this definition.

     <p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

     <li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     <li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. 
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

     <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     <li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

          <ol type=A start=1>
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

          <li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

          <li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

          <li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

          <li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

          <li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

          <li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

          <li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

          <li>Preserve the section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

          <li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

          <li>For any section Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

          <li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

          <li>Delete any section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

          <li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo; or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

          <li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          </ol>

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     <p>You may add a section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties&mdash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     <li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

     <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
and any sections Entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.  You must delete all
sections Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements.&rdquo;

     <li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     <li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. 
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

     <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. 
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

     <li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     <p>If a section in the Document is Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

     <li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

     <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

     <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

     <li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

     <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix C Command Line Arguments for Emacs Invocation</h2>

<p><a name="index-command-line-arguments-4825"></a><a name="index-arguments-_0028command-line_0029-4826"></a><a name="index-options-_0028command-line_0029-4827"></a><a name="index-switches-_0028command-line_0029-4828"></a><a name="index-startup-_0028command-line-arguments_0029-4829"></a><a name="index-invocation-_0028command-line-arguments_0029-4830"></a><!-- FIXME: Document '-smid'?  -xfq -->

   <p>Emacs supports command line arguments to request various actions
when invoking Emacs.  These are for compatibility with other editors
and for sophisticated activities.  We don't recommend using them for
ordinary editing (See <a href="#Emacs-Server">Emacs Server</a>, for a way to access an existing
Emacs job from the command line).

   <p>Arguments starting with `<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>' are <dfn>options</dfn>, and so is
`<samp><span class="samp">+</span><var>linenum</var></samp>'.  All other arguments specify files to visit. 
Emacs visits the specified files while it starts up.  The last file
specified on the command line becomes the current buffer; the other
files are also visited in other buffers.  As with most programs, the
special argument `<samp><span class="samp">--</span></samp>' says that all subsequent arguments are file
names, not options, even if they start with `<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>'.

   <p>Emacs command options can specify many things, such as the size and
position of the X window Emacs uses, its colors, and so on.  A few
options support advanced usage, such as running Lisp functions on files
in batch mode.  The sections of this chapter describe the available
options, arranged according to their purpose.

   <p>There are two ways of writing options: the short forms that start with
a single `<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>', and the long forms that start with `<samp><span class="samp">--</span></samp>'.  For
example, `<samp><span class="samp">-d</span></samp>' is a short form and `<samp><span class="samp">--display</span></samp>' is the
corresponding long form.

   <p>The long forms with `<samp><span class="samp">--</span></samp>' are easier to remember, but longer to
type.  However, you don't have to spell out the whole option name; any
unambiguous abbreviation is enough.  When a long option takes an
argument, you can use either a space or an equal sign to separate the
option name and the argument.  Thus, you can write either
`<samp><span class="samp">--display sugar-bombs:0.0</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">--display=sugar-bombs:0.0</span></samp>'. 
We recommend an equal sign because it makes the relationship clearer,
and the tables below always show an equal sign.

the Emacs session.  We call them <dfn>initial options</dfn>.  A few options
specify things to do, such as loading libraries or calling Lisp
functions.  These are called <dfn>action options</dfn>.  These and file
names together are called <dfn>action arguments</dfn>.  The action
arguments are stored as a list of strings in the variable
<code>command-line-args</code>.  (Actually, when Emacs starts up,
<code>command-line-args</code> contains all the arguments passed from the
command line; during initialization, the initial arguments are removed
from this list when they are processed, leaving only the action
arguments.)

<h3 class="appendixsec">C.1 Action Arguments</h3>

<p>Here is a table of action arguments:

     <dl>

See <a href="#Visiting">Visiting</a>.

     <p>When Emacs starts up, it displays the startup buffer in one window,
and the buffer visiting <var>file</var> in another window
(see <a href="#Windows">Windows</a>).  If you supply more than one file argument, the
displayed file is the last one specified on the command line; the
other files are visited but their buffers are not shown.

     <p>If the startup buffer is disabled (see <a href="#Entering-Emacs">Entering Emacs</a>), then
<var>file</var> is visited in a single window if one file argument was
supplied; with two file arguments, Emacs displays the files in two
different windows; with more than two file argument, Emacs displays
the last file specified in one window, plus a Buffer Menu in a
different window (see <a href="#Several-Buffers">Several Buffers</a>).  To inhibit using the
Buffer Menu for this, change the variable
<code>inhibit-startup-buffer-menu</code> to <code>t</code>.

If <var>file</var> is not an absolute file name, Emacs first looks for it
in the current directory, then in the directories listed in
<code>load-path</code> (see <a href="#Lisp-Libraries">Lisp Libraries</a>).

     <p><strong>Warning:</strong> If previous command-line arguments have visited
files, the current directory is the directory of the last file
visited.

If you specify multiple `<samp><span class="samp">-L</span></samp>' options, Emacs preserves the
relative order; i.e., using `<samp><span class="samp">-L /foo -L /bar</span></samp>' results in
a <code>load-path</code> of the form <code>("/foo" "/bar" ...)</code>. 
If <var>dir</var> begins with `<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>', Emacs removes the `<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>' and
appends (rather than prepends) the remainder to <code>load-path</code>. 
(On MS Windows, use `<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>' instead of `<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>'; i.e., use
the value of <code>path-separator</code>.)

earlier on the command line visit files or switch buffers, that might
be a different buffer.  The effect of this command-line argument is

<h3 class="appendixsec">C.2 Initial Options</h3>

<p>The initial options specify parameters for the Emacs session.  This
section describes the more general initial options; some other options
specifically related to the X Window System appear in the following
sections.

   <p>Some initial options affect the loading of the initialization file. 
Normally, Emacs first loads <samp><span class="file">site-start.el</span></samp> if it exists, then
your own initialization file if it exists, and finally the default
initialization file <samp><span class="file">default.el</span></samp> if it exists (see <a href="#Init-File">Init File</a>).  Certain options prevent loading of some of these files or
substitute other files for them.

     <dl>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">-chdir </span><var>directory</var></samp>'<dd><a name="index-g_t_002dchdir-4856"></a><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--chdir=</span><var>directory</var></samp>'<dd><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dchdir-4857"></a><a name="index-change-Emacs-directory-4858"></a>Change to <var>directory</var> before doing anything else.  This is mainly used
by session management in X so that Emacs starts in the same directory as it
stopped.  This makes desktop saving and restoring easier.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">-t </span><var>device</var></samp>'<dd><a name="index-g_t_002dt-4859"></a><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--terminal=</span><var>device</var></samp>'<dd><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dterminal-4860"></a><a name="index-device-for-Emacs-terminal-I_002fO-4861"></a>Use <var>device</var> as the device for terminal input and output.  This
option implies `<samp><span class="samp">--no-window-system</span></samp>'.

the initial Emacs frame.  See <a href="#Display-X">Display X</a>, for more details.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">-nw</span></samp>'<dd><a name="index-g_t_002dnw-4865"></a><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--no-window-system</span></samp>'<dd><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dno_002dwindow_002dsystem-4866"></a><a name="index-disable-window-system-4867"></a>Don't communicate directly with the window system, disregarding the
<samp><span class="env">DISPLAY</span></samp> environment variable even if it is set.  This means that
Emacs uses the terminal from which it was launched for all its display
and input.

     <p><a name="index-batch-mode-4868"></a><br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">-batch</span></samp>'<dd><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dbatch-4869"></a><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--batch</span></samp>'<dd>Run Emacs in <dfn>batch mode</dfn>.  Batch mode is used for running
programs written in Emacs Lisp from shell scripts, makefiles, and so
on.  To invoke a Lisp program, use the `<samp><span class="samp">-batch</span></samp>' option in
conjunction with one or more of `<samp><span class="samp">-l</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">-f</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">--eval</span></samp>'
(see <a href="#Action-Arguments">Action Arguments</a>).  See <a href="#Command-Example">Command Example</a>, for an example.

     <p>In batch mode, Emacs does not display the text being edited, and the
standard terminal interrupt characters such as <kbd>C-z</kbd> and <kbd>C-c</kbd>
have their usual effect.  Emacs functions that normally print a
message in the echo area will print to either the standard output
stream (<code>stdout</code>) or the standard error stream (<code>stderr</code>)
instead.  (To be precise, functions like <code>prin1</code>, <code>princ</code>
and <code>print</code> print to <code>stdout</code>, while <code>message</code> and
<code>error</code> print to <code>stderr</code>.)  Functions that normally read
keyboard input from the minibuffer take their input from the
terminal's standard input stream (<code>stdin</code>) instead.

     <p>`<samp><span class="samp">--batch</span></samp>' implies `<samp><span class="samp">-q</span></samp>' (do not load an initialization file),
but <samp><span class="file">site-start.el</span></samp> is loaded nonetheless.  It also causes Emacs
to exit after processing all the command options.  In addition, it
disables auto-saving except in buffers for which auto-saving is
explicitly requested, and when saving files it omits the <code>fsync</code>
system call unless otherwise requested.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--script </span><var>file</var></samp>'<dd><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dscript-4870"></a><a name="index-script-mode-4871"></a>Run Emacs in batch mode, like `<samp><span class="samp">--batch</span></samp>', and then read and
execute the Lisp code in <var>file</var>.

     <p>The normal use of this option is in executable script files that run
Emacs.  They can start with this text on the first line

     <pre class="example">          #!/usr/bin/emacs --script
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">which will invoke Emacs with `<samp><span class="samp">--script</span></samp>' and supply the name of
the script file as <var>file</var>.  Emacs Lisp then treats the `<samp><span class="samp">#!</span></samp>'
on this first line as a comment delimiter.

When Emacs
is invoked with this option, the Customize facility does not allow
options to be saved (see <a href="#Easy-Customization">Easy Customization</a>).  This option does
not disable loading <samp><span class="file">site-start.el</span></samp>.

<h3 class="appendixsec">C.3 Command Argument Example</h3>

<p>Here is an example of using Emacs with arguments and options.  It
assumes you have a Lisp program file called <samp><span class="file">hack-c.el</span></samp> which, when
loaded, performs some useful operation on the current buffer, expected
to be a C program.

<pre class="example">     emacs --batch foo.c -l hack-c -f save-buffer &gt;&amp; log
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This says to visit <samp><span class="file">foo.c</span></samp>, load <samp><span class="file">hack-c.el</span></samp> (which makes
changes in the visited file), save <samp><span class="file">foo.c</span></samp> (note that
<code>save-buffer</code> is the function that <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd> is bound to), and
then exit back to the shell (because of `<samp><span class="samp">--batch</span></samp>').  `<samp><span class="samp">--batch</span></samp>'
also guarantees there will be no problem redirecting output to
<samp><span class="file">log</span></samp>, because Emacs will not assume that it has a display terminal
to work with.

<h3 class="appendixsec">C.4 Environment Variables</h3>

<p><a name="index-environment-variables-4895"></a>
  The <dfn>environment</dfn> is a feature of the operating system; it
consists of a collection of variables with names and values.  Each
variable is called an <dfn>environment variable</dfn>; environment variable
names are case-sensitive, and it is conventional to use upper case
letters only.  The values are all text strings.

   <p>What makes the environment useful is that subprocesses inherit the
environment automatically from their parent process.  This means you
can set up an environment variable in your login shell, and all the
programs you run (including Emacs) will automatically see it. 
Subprocesses of Emacs (such as shells, compilers, and version control
programs) inherit the environment from Emacs, too.

   <p><a name="index-setenv-4896"></a><a name="index-getenv-4897"></a><a name="index-initial_002denvironment-4898"></a>  Inside Emacs, the command <kbd>M-x getenv</kbd> reads the name of an
environment variable, and prints its value in the echo area.  <kbd>M-x
setenv</kbd> sets a variable in the Emacs environment, and <kbd>C-u M-x
setenv</kbd> removes a variable.  (Environment variable substitutions with
`<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>' work in the value just as in file names; see <a href="#File-Names-with-_0024">File Names with $</a>.)  The variable <code>initial-environment</code> stores the initial
environment inherited by Emacs.

   <p>The way to set environment variables outside of Emacs depends on the
operating system, and especially the shell that you are using.  For
example, here's how to set the environment variable <samp><span class="env">ORGANIZATION</span></samp>
to `<samp><span class="samp">not very much</span></samp>' using Bash:

<pre class="example">     export ORGANIZATION="not very much"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and here's how to do it in csh or tcsh:

<pre class="example">     setenv ORGANIZATION "not very much"
</pre>
   <p>When Emacs is using the X Window System, various environment
variables that control X work for Emacs as well.  See the X
documentation for more information.

<h4 class="appendixsubsec">C.4.1 General Variables</h4>

<p>Here is an alphabetical list of environment variables that have
special meanings in Emacs.  Most of these variables are also used by
some other programs.  Emacs does not require any of these environment
variables to be set, but it uses their values if they are set.

<!-- This used to be @vtable, but that enters the variables alone into -->
<!-- the Variable Index, which in some cases, like HOME, might be -->
<!-- confused with keys by that name, and other cases, like NAME, -->
<!-- might be confused with general-purpose phrases. -->

need to change it.  Setting it to a dummy address, like
`<samp><span class="samp">unix:path=/dev/null</span></samp>', suppresses connections to the D-Bus session
bus as well as autolaunching the D-Bus session bus if not running yet. 
<br><dt><samp><span class="env">EMACSDATA</span></samp><dd><a name="index-EMACSDATA_002c-environment-variable-4901"></a>Directory for the architecture-independent files that come with Emacs.

A colon-separated list of directories<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-22" name="fnd-22"><sup>22</sup></a> to search for
Emacs Lisp files.  If set, it modifies the usual initial value of the
<code>load-path</code> variable (see <a href="#Lisp-Libraries">Lisp Libraries</a>).  An empty element
stands for the default value of <code>load-path</code>; e.g., using
`<samp><span class="samp">EMACSLOADPATH="/tmp:"</span></samp>' adds <samp><span class="file">/tmp</span></samp> to the front of
the default <code>load-path</code>.  To specify an empty element in the

This variable defaults to <samp><span class="file">~/.bash_history</span></samp> if you use Bash, to
<samp><span class="file">~/.sh_history</span></samp> if you use ksh, and to <samp><span class="file">~/.history</span></samp>
otherwise.

expansion of file names starting with a tilde (<samp><span class="file">~</span></samp>).  On MS-DOS,
it defaults to the directory from which Emacs was started, with
`<samp><span class="samp">/bin</span></samp>' removed from the end if it was present.  On Windows, the
default value of <samp><span class="env">HOME</span></samp> is the <samp><span class="file">Application Data</span></samp>
subdirectory of the user profile directory (normally, this is
<samp><span class="file">C:/Documents and Settings/</span><var>username</var><span class="file">/Application Data</span></samp>,
where <var>username</var> is your user name), though for backwards
compatibility <samp><span class="file">C:/</span></samp> will be used instead if a <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file

<samp><span class="env">LANG</span></samp> environment variable, or to the default `<samp><span class="samp">C</span></samp>' locale if
<samp><span class="env">LANG</span></samp> is not set.  But if <samp><span class="env">LC_ALL</span></samp> is specified, it overrides
the settings of all the other locale environment variables.

     <p>On MS-Windows and OS X, if <samp><span class="env">LANG</span></samp> is not already set in the

<dt><samp><span class="env">COMSPEC</span></samp><a name="index-COMSPEC-4939"></a><dd>On MS-DOS and MS-Windows, the name of the command interpreter to use
when invoking batch files and commands internal to the shell.  On MS-DOS
this is also used to make a default value for the <samp><span class="env">SHELL</span></samp> environment
variable.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="env">NAME</span></samp><a name="index-NAME-4940"></a><dd>On MS-DOS, this variable defaults to the value of the <samp><span class="env">USER</span></samp>
variable.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="env">EMACSTEST</span></samp><a name="index-EMACSTEST-4941"></a><dd>On MS-DOS, this specifies a file to use to log the operation of the
internal terminal emulator.  This feature is useful for submitting bug
reports.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="env">EMACSCOLORS</span></samp><a name="index-EMACSCOLORS-4942"></a><dd>On MS-DOS, this specifies the screen colors.  It is useful to set them
this way, since otherwise Emacs would display the default colors
momentarily when it starts up.

     <p>The value of this variable should be the two-character encoding of the
foreground (the first character) and the background (the second
character) colors of the default face.  Each character should be the
hexadecimal code for the desired color on a standard PC text-mode
display.  For example, to get blue text on a light gray background,
specify `<samp><span class="samp">EMACSCOLORS=17</span></samp>', since 1 is the code of the blue color and
7 is the code of the light gray color.

     <p>The PC display usually supports only eight background colors.  However,
Emacs switches the DOS display to a mode where all 16 colors can be used
for the background, so all four bits of the background color are
actually used.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="env">PRELOAD_WINSOCK</span></samp><a name="index-PRELOAD_005fWINSOCK-4943"></a><dd>On MS-Windows, if you set this variable, Emacs will load and initialize
the network library at startup, instead of waiting until the first
time it is required.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="env">emacs_dir</span></samp><a name="index-emacs_005fdir-4944"></a><dd>On MS-Windows, <samp><span class="env">emacs_dir</span></samp> is a special environment variable, which
indicates the full path of the directory in which Emacs is installed. 
If Emacs is installed in the standard directory structure, it
calculates this value automatically.  It is not much use setting this
variable yourself unless your installation is non-standard, since
unlike other environment variables, it will be overridden by Emacs at
startup.  When setting other environment variables, such as
<samp><span class="env">EMACSLOADPATH</span></samp>, you may find it useful to use <samp><span class="env">emacs_dir</span></samp>
rather than hard-coding an absolute path.  This allows multiple
versions of Emacs to share the same environment variable settings, and
it allows you to move the Emacs installation directory, without
changing any environment or registry settings.

On MS-Windows, the installation program <samp><span class="command">addpm.exe</span></samp> adds
values for <samp><span class="env">emacs_dir</span></samp>, <samp><span class="env">EMACSLOADPATH</span></samp>, <samp><span class="env">EMACSDATA</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="env">EMACSPATH</span></samp>, <samp><span class="env">EMACSDOC</span></samp>, <samp><span class="env">SHELL</span></samp> and <samp><span class="env">TERM</span></samp> to the
<samp><span class="file">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</span></samp> section of the system registry, under
<samp><span class="file">/Software/GNU/Emacs</span></samp>.  It does this because there is no standard
place to set environment variables across different versions of
Windows.  Running <samp><span class="command">addpm.exe</span></samp> is no longer strictly necessary
in recent versions of Emacs, but if you are upgrading from an older
version, running <samp><span class="command">addpm.exe</span></samp> ensures that you do not have
older registry entries from a previous installation, which may not be
compatible with the latest version of Emacs.

   <p>When Emacs starts, as well as checking the environment, it also checks
the System Registry for those variables and for <samp><span class="env">HOME</span></samp>, <samp><span class="env">LANG</span></samp>
and <samp><span class="env">PRELOAD_WINSOCK</span></samp>.

   <p>To determine the value of those variables, Emacs goes through the
following procedure.  First, the environment is checked.  If the
variable is not found there, Emacs looks for registry keys by that

<h3 class="appendixsec">C.5 Specifying the Display Name</h3>

<p><a name="index-display-name-_0028X-Window-System_0029-4947"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040env_007bDISPLAY_007d-environment-variable-4948"></a>
  The environment variable <samp><span class="env">DISPLAY</span></samp> tells all X clients,
including Emacs, where to display their windows.  Its value is set by
default in ordinary circumstances, when you start an X server and run
jobs locally.  You can specify the display yourself; one reason to do
this is if you want to log into another system and run Emacs there,
and have the window displayed at your local terminal.

   <p><samp><span class="env">DISPLAY</span></samp> has the syntax
`<samp><var>host</var><span class="samp">:</span><var>display</var><span class="samp">.</span><var>screen</var></samp>', where <var>host</var> is the
host name of the X Window System server machine, <var>display</var> is an
arbitrarily-assigned number that distinguishes your server (X
terminal) from other servers on the same machine, and <var>screen</var> is
a field that allows an X server to control multiple terminal screens. 
The period and the <var>screen</var> field are optional.  If included,
<var>screen</var> is usually zero.

   <p>For example, if your host is named `<samp><span class="samp">glasperle</span></samp>' and your server is
the first (or perhaps the only) server listed in the configuration, your
<samp><span class="env">DISPLAY</span></samp> is `<samp><span class="samp">glasperle:0.0</span></samp>'.

   <p>You can specify the display name explicitly when you run Emacs, either
by changing the <samp><span class="env">DISPLAY</span></samp> variable, or with the option `<samp><span class="samp">-d
</span><var>display</var></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">--display=</span><var>display</var></samp>'.  Here is an example:

<pre class="smallexample">     emacs --display=glasperle:0 &amp;
</pre>
   <p>You can inhibit the use of the X window system with the `<samp><span class="samp">-nw</span></samp>'
option.  Then Emacs uses its controlling text terminal for display. 
See <a href="#Initial-Options">Initial Options</a>.

   <p>Sometimes, security arrangements prevent a program on a remote system
from displaying on your local system.  In this case, trying to run Emacs
produces messages like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     Xlib:  connection to "glasperle:0.0" refused by server
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You might be able to overcome this problem by using the <samp><span class="command">xhost</span></samp>
command on the local system to give permission for access from your
remote machine.

Depending on your terminal's capabilities, Emacs might be able to turn
on a color mode for 8, 16, 88, or 256 as the value of <var>num</var>.  If
there is no mode that supports <var>num</var> colors, Emacs acts as if
<var>num</var> were 0, i.e., it uses the terminal's default color support
mode.

     If <var>mode</var> is omitted, it defaults to <var>ansi8</var>.

  Here is a list of the command-line options for specifying size and
position of the initial Emacs frame:

     <dl>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">-g </span><var>width</var><span class="samp">x</span><var>height</var><span class="samp">[{+-}</span><var>xoffset</var><span class="samp">{+-}</span><var>yoffset</var><span class="samp">]]</span></samp>'<dd><a name="index-g_t_002dg-4981"></a><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--geometry=</span><var>width</var><span class="samp">x</span><var>height</var><span class="samp">[{+-}</span><var>xoffset</var><span class="samp">{+-}</span><var>yoffset</var><span class="samp">]]</span></samp>'<dd><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dgeometry-4982"></a><a name="index-geometry_002c-command_002dline-argument-4983"></a>Specify the size <var>width</var> and <var>height</var> (measured in character
columns and lines), and positions <var>xoffset</var> and <var>yoffset</var>
(measured in pixels).  The <var>width</var> and <var>height</var> parameters
apply to all frames, whereas <var>xoffset</var> and <var>yoffset</var> only to
the initial frame.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">-fs</span></samp>'<dd><a name="index-g_t_002dfs-4984"></a><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--fullscreen</span></samp>'<dd><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dfullscreen-4985"></a><a name="index-fullscreen_002c-command_002dline-argument-4986"></a>Specify that width and height should be that of the screen.  Normally

This normally
means that the frame has window manager decorations. 
(After starting Emacs, you can toggle this state using <kbd>M-F10</kbd>,
<code>toggle-frame-maximized</code>.)

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">-fh</span></samp>'<dd><a name="index-g_t_002dfh-4990"></a><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--fullheight</span></samp>'<dd><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dfullheight-4991"></a><a name="index-fullheight_002c-command_002dline-argument-4992"></a>Specify that the height should be the height of the screen.

</dl>

<p class="noindent">In the `<samp><span class="samp">--geometry</span></samp>' option, <span class="roman">{</span><code>+-</code><span class="roman">}</span> means either a plus
 sign or a minus sign.  A plus
sign before <var>xoffset</var> means it is the distance from the left side of
the screen; a minus sign means it counts from the right side.  A plus
sign before <var>yoffset</var> means it is the distance from the top of the
screen, and a minus sign there indicates the distance from the bottom. 
The values <var>xoffset</var> and <var>yoffset</var> may themselves be positive or
negative, but that doesn't change their meaning, only their direction.

   <p>Emacs uses the same units as <samp><span class="command">xterm</span></samp> does to interpret the geometry. 
The <var>width</var> and <var>height</var> are measured in characters, so a large font
creates a larger frame than a small font.  (If you specify a proportional
font, Emacs uses its maximum bounds width as the width unit.)  The
<var>xoffset</var> and <var>yoffset</var> are measured in pixels.

   <p>You do not have to specify all of the fields in the geometry
specification.  If you omit both <var>xoffset</var> and <var>yoffset</var>, the
window manager decides where to put the Emacs frame, possibly by
letting you place it with the mouse.  For example, `<samp><span class="samp">164x55</span></samp>'
specifies a window 164 columns wide, enough for two ordinary width
windows side by side, and 55 lines tall.

   <p>The default frame width is 80 characters and the default height is
40 lines.  You can omit either the width or the height or both.  If
you start the geometry with an integer, Emacs interprets it as the
width.  If you start with an `<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>' followed by an integer, Emacs
interprets it as the height.  Thus, `<samp><span class="samp">81</span></samp>' specifies just the
width; `<samp><span class="samp">x45</span></samp>' specifies just the height.

   <p>If you start with `<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>', that introduces an offset,
which means both sizes are omitted.  Thus, `<samp><span class="samp">-3</span></samp>' specifies the
<var>xoffset</var> only.  (If you give just one offset, it is always
<var>xoffset</var>.)  `<samp><span class="samp">+3-3</span></samp>' specifies both the <var>xoffset</var> and the
<var>yoffset</var>, placing the frame near the bottom left of the screen.

   <p>You can specify a default for any or all of the fields in your X
resource file (see <a href="#Resources">Resources</a>), and then override selected fields
with a `<samp><span class="samp">--geometry</span></samp>' option.

   <p>Since the mode line and the echo area occupy the last 2 lines of the
frame, the height of the initial text window is 2 less than the height
specified in your geometry.  In non-X-toolkit versions of Emacs, the
menu bar also takes one line of the specified number.  But in the X
toolkit version, the menu bar is additional and does not count against
the specified height.  The tool bar, if present, is also additional.

   <p>Enabling or disabling the menu bar or tool bar alters the amount of
space available for ordinary text.  Therefore, if Emacs starts up with
a tool bar (which is the default), and handles the geometry
specification assuming there is a tool bar, and then your
initialization file disables the tool bar, you will end up with a
frame geometry different from what you asked for.  To get the intended
size with no tool bar, use an X resource to specify &ldquo;no tool bar&rdquo;
(see <a href="#Table-of-Resources">Table of Resources</a>); then Emacs will already know there's no
tool bar when it processes the specified geometry.

   <p>When using one of `<samp><span class="samp">--fullscreen</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">--maximized</span></samp>',
`<samp><span class="samp">--fullwidth</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">--fullheight</span></samp>', some window managers require
you to set the variable <code>frame-resize-pixelwise</code> to a non-<code>nil</code>
value to make a frame appear truly maximized or full-screen.

   <p>Some window managers have options that can make them ignore both
program-specified and user-specified positions.  If these are set,
Emacs fails to position the window correctly.

<h3 class="appendixsec">C.9 Internal and External Borders</h3>

<p><a name="index-borders-_0028X-Window-System_0029-4996"></a>
  An Emacs frame has an internal border and an external border.  The
internal border is an extra strip of the background color around the
text portion of the frame.  Emacs itself draws the internal border. 
The external border is added by the window manager outside the frame;
depending on the window manager you use, it may contain various boxes
you can click on to move or iconify the window.

     <dl>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">-ib </span><var>width</var></samp>'<dd><a name="index-g_t_002dib-4997"></a><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--internal-border=</span><var>width</var></samp>'<dd><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dinternal_002dborder-4998"></a><a name="index-internal-border-width_002c-command_002dline-argument-4999"></a>Specify <var>width</var> as the width of the internal border (between the text

</dl>

   <p>When you specify the size of the frame, that does not count the
borders.  The frame's position is measured from the outside edge of the
external border.

   <p>Use the `<samp><span class="samp">-ib </span><var>n</var></samp>' option to specify an internal border
<var>n</var> pixels wide.  The default is 1.  Use `<samp><span class="samp">-bw </span><var>n</var></samp>' to
specify the width of the external border (though the window manager may
not pay attention to what you specify).  The default width of the
external border is 2.

<h3 class="appendixsec">C.10 Frame Titles</h3>

<p>An Emacs frame may or may not have a specified title.  The frame
title, if specified, appears in window decorations and icons as the

default title has the form `<samp><var>invocation-name</var><span class="samp">@</span><var>machine</var></samp>'

there is more than one frame).

   <p>You can specify a title for the initial Emacs frame with a command

   <p>Most window managers allow you to iconify (or &ldquo;minimize&rdquo;) an
Emacs frame, hiding it from sight.  Some window managers replace
iconified windows with tiny icons, while others remove them
entirely from sight.  The `<samp><span class="samp">-iconic</span></samp>' option tells Emacs to begin
running in an iconified state, rather than showing a frame right away. 
The text frame doesn't appear until you deiconify (or &ldquo;un-minimize&rdquo;)
it.

   <p>By default, Emacs uses an icon containing the Emacs logo.  On
desktop environments such as Gnome, this icon is also displayed in
other contexts, e.g., when switching into an Emacs frame.  The
`<samp><span class="samp">-nbi</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">--no-bitmap-icon</span></samp>' option tells Emacs to let the
window manager choose what sort of icon to use&mdash;usually just a small
rectangle containing the frame's title.

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix D X Options and Resources</h2>

<p>You can customize some X-related aspects of Emacs behavior using X
resources, as is usual for programs that use X.

   <p>When Emacs is compiled with GTK+ support, the appearance of various
graphical widgets, such as the menu-bar, scroll-bar, and dialog boxes,
is determined by
GTK resources, which we will also describe. 
When Emacs is built without GTK+ support, the appearance of these
widgets is determined by additional X resources.

   <p>On MS-Windows, you can customize some of the same aspects using the
system registry (see <a href="#MS_002dWindows-Registry">MS-Windows Registry</a>).

<h3 class="appendixsec">D.1 X Resources</h3>

<p><a name="index-resources-5024"></a><a name="index-X-resources-5025"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007b_007e_002f_002eXdefaults_007d-file-5026"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007b_007e_002f_002eXresources_007d-file-5027"></a>
  Programs running under the X Window System organize their user
options under a hierarchy of classes and resources.  You can specify
default values for these options in your <dfn>X resource file</dfn>,
usually named <samp><span class="file">~/.Xdefaults</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">~/.Xresources</span></samp>.  Changes in
this file do not take effect immediately, because the X server stores
its own list of resources; to update it, use the command
<samp><span class="command">xrdb</span></samp>&mdash;for instance, `<samp><span class="samp">xrdb ~/.Xdefaults</span></samp>'.

   <p><a name="index-registry_002c-setting-resources-_0028MS_002dWindows_0029-5028"></a>  (MS-Windows systems do not support X resource files; on such systems,
Emacs looks for X resources in the Windows Registry, first under the
key `<samp><span class="samp">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\GNU\Emacs</span></samp>', which affects only
the current user and override the system-wide settings, and then under
the key `<samp><span class="samp">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\GNU\Emacs</span></samp>', which affects
all users of the system.  The menu and scroll bars are native widgets
on MS-Windows, so they are only customizable via the system-wide
settings in the Display Control Panel.  You can also set resources
using the `<samp><span class="samp">-xrm</span></samp>' command line option, as explained below.)

   <p>Each line in the X resource file specifies a value for one option or
for a collection of related options.  The order in which the lines
appear in the file does not matter.  Each resource specification
consists of a <dfn>program name</dfn> and a <dfn>resource name</dfn>.  Case
distinctions are significant in each of these names.  Here is an
example:

<pre class="example">     emacs.cursorColor: dark green
</pre>
   <p>The program name is the name of the executable file to which the
resource applies.  For Emacs, this is normally `<samp><span class="samp">emacs</span></samp>'.  To
specify a definition that applies to all instances of Emacs,
regardless of the name of the Emacs executable, use `<samp><span class="samp">Emacs</span></samp>'.

   <p>The resource name is the name of a program setting.  For instance,
Emacs recognizes a `<samp><span class="samp">cursorColor</span></samp>' resource that controls the color
of the text cursor.

   <p>Resources are grouped into named classes.  For instance, the
`<samp><span class="samp">Foreground</span></samp>' class contains the `<samp><span class="samp">cursorColor</span></samp>',
`<samp><span class="samp">foreground</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">pointerColor</span></samp>' resources (see <a href="#Table-of-Resources">Table of Resources</a>).  Instead of using a resource name, you can use a class
name to specify the default value for all resources in that class,
like this:

<pre class="example">     emacs.Foreground: dark green
</pre>
   <p>Emacs does not process X resources at all if you set the variable
<code>inhibit-x-resources</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> value.  If you invoke
Emacs with the `<samp><span class="samp">-Q</span></samp>' (or `<samp><span class="samp">--quick</span></samp>') command-line option,
<code>inhibit-x-resources</code> is automatically set to <code>t</code>
(see <a href="#Initial-Options">Initial Options</a>).

   <p>In addition, you can use the following command-line options to
override the X resources file:

     <dl>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">-name </span><var>name</var></samp>'<dd><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dname-5029"></a><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--name=</span><var>name</var></samp>'<dd><a name="index-resource-name_002c-command_002dline-argument-5030"></a>This option sets the program name of the initial Emacs frame to
<var>name</var>.  It also sets the title of the initial frame to
<var>name</var>.  This option does not affect subsequent frames.

     <p>If you don't specify this option, the default is to use the Emacs
executable's name as the program name.

     <p>For consistency, `<samp><span class="samp">-name</span></samp>' also specifies the name to use for other
resource values that do not belong to any particular frame.

     <p>The resources that name Emacs invocations also belong to a class,
named `<samp><span class="samp">Emacs</span></samp>'.  If you write `<samp><span class="samp">Emacs</span></samp>' instead of
`<samp><span class="samp">emacs</span></samp>', the resource applies to all frames in all Emacs jobs,
regardless of frame titles and regardless of the name of the
executable file.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">-xrm </span><var>resource-values</var></samp>'<dd><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dxrm-5031"></a><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--xrm=</span><var>resource-values</var></samp>'<dd><a name="index-resource-values_002c-command_002dline-argument-5032"></a>This option specifies X resource values for the present Emacs job.

     <p><var>resource-values</var> should have the same format that you would use
inside a file of X resources.  To include multiple resource
specifications in <var>resource-values</var>, put a newline between them,
just as you would in a file.  You can also use `<samp><span class="samp">#include
"</span><var>filename</var><span class="samp">"</span></samp>' to include a file full of resource specifications. 
Resource values specified with `<samp><span class="samp">-xrm</span></samp>' take precedence over all
other resource specifications.

<h3 class="appendixsec">D.2 Table of X Resources for Emacs</h3>

<p>This table lists the X resource names that Emacs recognizes,
excluding those that control the appearance of graphical widgets like
the menu bar:

     <dl>
<dt><code>background</code> (class <code>Background</code>)<dd>Background color (see <a href="#Colors">Colors</a>).

     <br><dt><code>bitmapIcon</code> (class <code>BitmapIcon</code>)<dd>Tell the window manager to display the Emacs icon if `<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>'; don't
do so if `<samp><span class="samp">off</span></samp>'.  See <a href="#Icons-X">Icons X</a>, for a description of the icon.

     <br><dt><code>borderColor</code> (class <code>BorderColor</code>)<dd>Color of the frame's external border.  This has no effect if Emacs is
compiled with GTK+ support.

     <br><dt><code>borderWidth</code> (class <code>BorderWidth</code>)<dd>Width of the frame's external border, in pixels.  This has no effect
if Emacs is compiled with GTK+ support.

     <br><dt><code>cursorColor</code> (class <code>Foreground</code>)<dd>Text cursor color.  If this resource is specified when Emacs starts
up, Emacs sets its value as the background color of the <code>cursor</code>
face (see <a href="#Faces">Faces</a>).

     <br><dt><code>cursorBlink</code> (class <code>CursorBlink</code>)<dd>If the value of this resource is `<samp><span class="samp">off</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">false</span></samp>' or
`<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>' at startup, Emacs disables Blink Cursor mode (see <a href="#Cursor-Display">Cursor Display</a>).

     <br><dt><code>font</code> (class <code>Font</code>)<dd>Font name for the <code>default</code> face (see <a href="#Fonts">Fonts</a>).  You can also
specify a fontset name (see <a href="#Fontsets">Fontsets</a>).

     <br><dt><code>fontBackend</code> (class <code>FontBackend</code>)<dd>Comma-delimited list of backend(s) to use for drawing fonts, in order
of precedence.  For instance, the value `<samp><span class="samp">x,xft</span></samp>' tells Emacs to
draw fonts using the X core font driver, falling back on the Xft font
driver if that fails.  Normally, you should leave this resource unset,
in which case Emacs tries using all available font backends.

     <br><dt><code>foreground</code> (class <code>Foreground</code>)<dd>Default foreground color for text.

     <br><dt><code>geometry</code> (class <code>Geometry</code>)<dd>Window size and position.  The value should be a size and position
specification, of the same form as in the `<samp><span class="samp">-g</span></samp>' or
`<samp><span class="samp">--geometry</span></samp>' command-line option (see <a href="#Window-Size-X">Window Size X</a>).

     <p>The size applies to all frames in the Emacs session, but the position
applies only to the initial Emacs frame (or, in the case of a resource
for a specific frame name, only that frame).

     <p>Be careful not to specify this resource as `<samp><span class="samp">emacs*geometry</span></samp>', as
that may affect individual menus as well as the main Emacs frame.

     <br><dt><code>fullscreen</code> (class <code>Fullscreen</code>)<dd>The desired fullscreen size.  The value can be one of <code>fullboth</code>,
<code>maximized</code>, <code>fullwidth</code> or <code>fullheight</code>, which
correspond to the command-line options `<samp><span class="samp">-fs</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">-mm</span></samp>',
`<samp><span class="samp">-fw</span></samp>', and `<samp><span class="samp">-fh</span></samp>' (see <a href="#Window-Size-X">Window Size X</a>).  Note that this
applies to the initial frame only.

     <br><dt><code>iconName</code> (class <code>Title</code>)<dd>Name to display in the icon.

     <br><dt><code>internalBorder</code> (class <code>BorderWidth</code>)<dd>Width of the internal frame border, in pixels.

     <br><dt><code>lineSpacing</code> (class <code>LineSpacing</code>)<dd><a name="index-line-spacing-5033"></a>Additional space between lines, in pixels.

     <br><dt><code>menuBar</code> (class <code>MenuBar</code>)<dd><a name="index-menu-bar-5034"></a>If the value of this resource is `<samp><span class="samp">off</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">false</span></samp>' or
`<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>', Emacs disables Menu Bar mode at startup (see <a href="#Menu-Bars">Menu Bars</a>).

     <br><dt><code>minibuffer</code> (class <code>Minibuffer</code>)<dd>If `<samp><span class="samp">none</span></samp>', Emacs will not make a minibuffer in this frame; it
will use a separate minibuffer frame instead.

     <br><dt><code>paneFont</code> (class <code>Font</code>)<dd><a name="index-font-for-menus-5035"></a>Font name for menu pane titles, in non-toolkit versions of Emacs.

     <br><dt><code>pointerColor</code> (class <code>Foreground</code>)<dd>Color of the mouse cursor.  This has no effect in many graphical
desktop environments, as they do not let Emacs change the mouse cursor
this way.

     <br><dt><code>privateColormap</code> (class <code>PrivateColormap</code>)<dd>If `<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>', use a private color map, in the case where the default
visual of class PseudoColor and Emacs is using it.

     <br><dt><code>reverseVideo</code> (class <code>ReverseVideo</code>)<dd>Switch foreground and background default colors if `<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>', use colors as
specified if `<samp><span class="samp">off</span></samp>'.

     <br><dt><code>screenGamma</code> (class <code>ScreenGamma</code>)<dd><a name="index-gamma-correction-5036"></a>Gamma correction for colors, equivalent to the frame parameter
<code>screen-gamma</code>.

     <br><dt><code>scrollBarWidth</code> (class <code>ScrollBarWidth</code>)<dd><a name="index-scrollbar-width-5037"></a>The scroll bar width in pixels, equivalent to the frame parameter
<code>scroll-bar-width</code>.  Do not set this resource if Emacs is
compiled with GTK+ support.

     <br><dt><code>selectionFont</code> (class <code>SelectionFont</code>)<dd>Font name for pop-up menu items, in non-toolkit versions of Emacs.  (For
toolkit versions, see <a href="#Lucid-Resources">Lucid Resources</a>, also see <a href="#Motif-Resources">Motif Resources</a>.)

     <br><dt><code>selectionTimeout</code> (class <code>SelectionTimeout</code>)<dd>Number of milliseconds to wait for a selection reply. 
If the selection owner doesn't reply in this time, we give up. 
A value of 0 means wait as long as necessary.

     <br><dt><code>synchronous</code> (class <code>Synchronous</code>)<dd><a name="index-debugging-X-problems-5038"></a><a name="index-synchronous-X-mode-5039"></a>Run Emacs in synchronous mode if `<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>'.  Synchronous mode is
useful for debugging X problems.

     <br><dt><code>title</code> (class <code>Title</code>)<dd>Name to display in the title bar of the initial Emacs frame.

     <br><dt><code>toolBar</code> (class <code>ToolBar</code>)<dd><a name="index-tool-bar-5040"></a>If the value of this resource is `<samp><span class="samp">off</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">false</span></samp>' or
`<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>', Emacs disables Tool Bar mode at startup (see <a href="#Tool-Bars">Tool Bars</a>).

     <br><dt><code>useXIM</code> (class <code>UseXIM</code>)<dd><a name="index-XIM-5041"></a><a name="index-X-input-methods-5042"></a><a name="index-input-methods_002c-X-5043"></a>Disable use of X input methods (XIM) if `<samp><span class="samp">false</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">off</span></samp>'. 
This is only relevant if your Emacs is built with XIM support.  It
might be useful to turn off XIM on slow X client/server links.

     <br><dt><code>verticalScrollBars</code> (class <code>ScrollBars</code>)<dd>Give frames scroll bars if `<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>'; don't have scroll bars if
`<samp><span class="samp">off</span></samp>'.

     <br><dt><code>visualClass</code> (class <code>VisualClass</code>)<dd>The <dfn>visual class</dfn> for X color display.  If specified, the value
should start with one of `<samp><span class="samp">TrueColor</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">PseudoColor</span></samp>',
`<samp><span class="samp">DirectColor</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">StaticColor</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">GrayScale</span></samp>', and
`<samp><span class="samp">StaticGray</span></samp>', followed by `<samp><span class="samp">-</span><var>depth</var></samp>', where <var>depth</var>
is the number of color planes. 
</dl>

   <p>You can also use X resources to customize individual Emacs faces
(see <a href="#Faces">Faces</a>).  For example, setting the resource
`<samp><var>face</var><span class="samp">.attributeForeground</span></samp>' is equivalent to customizing the
`<samp><span class="samp">foreground</span></samp>' attribute of the face <var>face</var>.  However, we
recommend customizing faces from within Emacs, instead of using X
resources.  See <a href="#Face-Customization">Face Customization</a>.

  If Emacs is compiled with the X toolkit support using Lucid widgets,
you can use X resources to customize the appearance of the menu bar,
pop-up menus, and dialog boxes.  The resources for the menu bar fall
in the `<samp><span class="samp">pane.menubar</span></samp>' class (following, as always, either the
name of the Emacs executable or `<samp><span class="samp">Emacs</span></samp>' for all Emacs
invocations).  The resources for the pop-up menu are in the
`<samp><span class="samp">menu*</span></samp>' class.  The resources for dialog boxes are in the
`<samp><span class="samp">dialog*</span></samp>' class.

   <p>For example, to display menu bar entries with the `<samp><span class="samp">Courier-12</span></samp>'
font (see <a href="#Fonts">Fonts</a>), write this:

<pre class="example">     Emacs.pane.menubar.font: Courier-12
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Lucid widgets can display multilingual text in your locale.  To enable
this, specify a <code>fontSet</code> resource instead of a <code>font</code>
resource.  See <a href="#Fontsets">Fontsets</a>.  If both <code>font</code> and <code>fontSet</code>
resources are specified, the <code>fontSet</code> resource is used.

   <p>Here is a list of resources for menu bars, pop-up menus, and dialogs:

     <dl>
<dt><code>font</code><dd>Font for menu item text. 
<br><dt><code>fontSet</code><dd>Fontset for menu item text.

<br><dt><code>verticalSpacing</code><dd>Vertical spacing in pixels between items.  Default is 2. 
<br><dt><code>arrowSpacing</code><dd>Horizontal spacing between the arrow (which indicates a submenu) and
the associated text.  Default is 10. 
<br><dt><code>shadowThickness</code><dd>Thickness of shadow lines for 3D buttons, arrows, and other graphical

<h3 class="appendixsec">D.4 Motif Menu X Resources</h3>

<p><a name="index-Menu-X-Resources-_0028Motif-widgets_0029-5047"></a><a name="index-Motif-Widget-X-Resources-5048"></a>
  If Emacs is compiled with the X toolkit support using Motif or
LessTif widgets, you can use X resources to customize the appearance
of the menu bar, pop-up menus, and dialog boxes.  However, the
resources are organized differently from Lucid widgets.

   <p>The resource names for the menu bar are in the `<samp><span class="samp">pane.menubar</span></samp>'
class, and they must be specified in this form:

<pre class="smallexample">     Emacs.pane.menubar.<var>subwidget</var>.<var>resource</var>:  <var>value</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">For pop-up menus, the resources are in the `<samp><span class="samp">menu*</span></samp>' class, instead
of `<samp><span class="samp">pane.menubar</span></samp>'.  For dialog boxes, they are in `<samp><span class="samp">dialog</span></samp>'. 
In each case, each individual menu string is a subwidget; the
subwidget's name is the same as the menu item string.  For example,
the `<samp><span class="samp">File</span></samp>' menu in the menu bar is a subwidget named
`<samp><span class="samp">emacs.pane.menubar.File</span></samp>'.

   <p>Typically, you want to specify the same resources for the whole menu
bar.  To do this, use `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' instead of a specific subwidget name. 
For example, to specify the font `<samp><span class="samp">8x16</span></samp>' for all menu bar items,
including submenus, write this:

<pre class="smallexample">     Emacs.pane.menubar.*.fontList:  8x16
</pre>
   <p>Each item in a submenu also has its own name for X resources; for
example, the `<samp><span class="samp">File</span></samp>' submenu has an item named `<samp><span class="samp">Save (current
buffer)</span></samp>'.  A resource specification for a submenu item looks like
this:

<pre class="smallexample">     Emacs.pane.menubar.popup_*.<var>menu</var>.<var>item</var>.<var>resource</var>: <var>value</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">For example, here's how to specify the font for the `<samp><span class="samp">Save (current
buffer)</span></samp>' item:

<pre class="smallexample">     Emacs.pane.menubar.popup_*.File.Save (current buffer).fontList: 8x16
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">For an item in a second-level submenu, such as `<samp><span class="samp">Complete Word</span></samp>'
under `<samp><span class="samp">Spell Checking</span></samp>' under `<samp><span class="samp">Tools</span></samp>', the resource fits this
template:

<pre class="smallexample">     Emacs.pane.menubar.popup_*.popup_*.<var>menu</var>.<var>resource</var>: <var>value</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">For example,

<pre class="smallexample">     Emacs.pane.menubar.popup_*.popup_*.Spell Checking.Complete Word: <var>value</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(This should be one long line.)

   <p>If you want the submenu items to look different from the menu bar
itself, you must first specify the resource for all of them, then
override the value for submenus alone.  Here is an example:

<pre class="smallexample">     Emacs.pane.menubar.*.fontList:  8x16
     Emacs.pane.menubar.popup_*.fontList: 8x16
</pre>
   <p>To specify resources for the LessTif file-selection box, use
`<samp><span class="samp">fsb*</span></samp>', like this:

<pre class="example">     Emacs.fsb*.fontList: 8x16
</pre>
   <p>Here is a list of resources for LessTif menu bars and pop-up menus:

     <dl>
<dt><code>armColor</code><dd>The color to show in an armed button. 
<br><dt><code>fontList</code><dd>The font to use. 
<br><dt><code>marginBottom</code><dt><code>marginHeight</code><dt><code>marginLeft</code><dt><code>marginRight</code><dt><code>marginTop</code><dt><code>marginWidth</code><dd>Amount of space to leave around the item, within the border. 
<br><dt><code>borderWidth</code><dd>The width of the border around the menu item, on all sides. 
<br><dt><code>shadowThickness</code><dd>The width of the border shadow. 
<br><dt><code>bottomShadowColor</code><dd>The color for the border shadow, on the bottom and the right.

  If Emacs is compiled with GTK+ toolkit support, the simplest way to
customize its GTK+ widgets (e.g., menus, dialogs, tool bars and
scroll bars) is to choose an appropriate GTK+ theme, for example with
the GNOME theme selector.

   <p>In GTK+ version 2, you can also use <dfn>GTK+ resources</dfn> to
customize the appearance of GTK+ widgets used by Emacs.  These
resources are specified in either the file <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs.d/gtkrc</span></samp>
(for Emacs-specific GTK+ resources), or <samp><span class="file">~/.gtkrc-2.0</span></samp> (for
general GTK+ resources).  We recommend using <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs.d/gtkrc</span></samp>,
since GTK+ seems to ignore <samp><span class="file">~/.gtkrc-2.0</span></samp> when running GConf with
GNOME.  Note, however, that some GTK themes may override
customizations in <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs.d/gtkrc</span></samp>; there is nothing we can do
about this.  GTK+ resources do not affect aspects of Emacs unrelated
to GTK+ widgets, such as fonts and colors in the main Emacs window;
those are governed by normal X resources (see <a href="#Resources">Resources</a>).

   <p>The following sections describe how to customize GTK+ resources for
Emacs.  For details about GTK+ resources, see the GTK+ API document at
<a href="http://developer.gnome.org/gtk2/stable/gtk2-Resource-Files.html">http://developer.gnome.org/gtk2/stable/gtk2-Resource-Files.html</a>.

   <p>In GTK+ version 3, GTK+ resources have been replaced by a completely
different system.  The appearance of GTK+ widgets is now determined by
CSS-like style files: <samp><span class="file">gtk-3.0/gtk.css</span></samp> in the GTK+ installation
directory, and <samp><span class="file">~/.themes/</span><var>theme</var><span class="file">/gtk-3.0/gtk.css</span></samp> for local
style settings (where <var>theme</var> is the name of the current GTK+
theme).  Therefore, the description of GTK+ resources in this section
does not apply to GTK+ 3.  For details about the GTK+ 3 styling
system, see
<a href="http://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/3.0/GtkCssProvider.html">http://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/3.0/GtkCssProvider.html</a>.

<h4 class="appendixsubsec">D.5.1 GTK Resource Basics</h4>

<p>In a GTK+ 2 resource file (usually <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs.d/gtkrc</span></samp>), the
simplest kinds of resource settings simply assign a value to a
variable.  For example, putting the following line in the resource
file changes the font on all GTK+ widgets to `<samp><span class="samp">courier-12</span></samp>':

<pre class="smallexample">     gtk-font-name = "courier 12"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Note that in this case the font name must be supplied as a GTK font
pattern (also called a <dfn>Pango font name</dfn>), not as a
Fontconfig-style font name or XLFD.  See <a href="#Fonts">Fonts</a>.

   <p>To customize widgets you first define a <dfn>style</dfn>, and then apply
the style to the widgets.  Here is an example that sets the font for
menus (`<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>' characters indicate comments):

<pre class="smallexample">     # <span class="roman">Define the style `<samp>my_style</samp>'.</span>
     style "my_style"
     {
       font_name = "helvetica bold 14"
     }
     
     # <span class="roman">Specify that widget type `<samp>*emacs-menuitem*</samp>' uses `<samp>my_style</samp>'.</span>
     widget "*emacs-menuitem*" style "my_style"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The widget name in this example contains wildcards, so the style is
applied to all widgets matching `<samp><span class="samp">*emacs-menuitem*</span></samp>'.  The widgets
are named by the way they are contained, from the outer widget to the
inner widget.  Here is another example that applies `<samp><span class="samp">my_style</span></samp>'
specifically to the Emacs menu bar:

<pre class="smallexample">     widget "Emacs.pane.menubar.*" style "my_style"
</pre>
   <p>Here is a more elaborate example, showing how to change the parts of
the scroll bar:

<pre class="smallexample">     style "scroll"
     {
       fg[NORMAL] = "red"     # <span class="roman">Arrow color.</span>
       bg[NORMAL] = "yellow"  # <span class="roman">Thumb and background around arrow.</span>
       bg[ACTIVE] = "blue"    # <span class="roman">Trough color.</span>
       bg[PRELIGHT] = "white" # <span class="roman">Thumb color when the mouse is over it.</span>
     }
     
     widget "*verticalScrollBar*" style "scroll"
</pre>

<h4 class="appendixsubsec">D.5.2 GTK widget names</h4>

<p><a name="index-GTK-widget-names-5053"></a>
  A GTK+ widget is specified by a <dfn>widget name</dfn> and a <dfn>widget
class</dfn>.  The widget name refers to a specific widget
(e.g., `<samp><span class="samp">emacs-menuitem</span></samp>'), while the widget class refers to a
collection of similar widgets (e.g., `<samp><span class="samp">GtkMenuItem</span></samp>').  A widget
always has a class, but need not have a name.

   <p><dfn>Absolute names</dfn> are sequences of widget names or widget
classes, corresponding to hierarchies of widgets embedded within
other widgets.  For example, if a <code>GtkWindow</code> named <code>top</code>
contains a <code>GtkVBox</code> named <code>box</code>, which in turn contains
a <code>GtkMenuBar</code> called <code>menubar</code>, the absolute class name
of the menu-bar widget is <code>GtkWindow.GtkVBox.GtkMenuBar</code>, and
its absolute widget name is <code>top.box.menubar</code>.

   <p>GTK+ resource files can contain two types of commands for specifying
widget appearances:

     <dl>
<dt><code>widget</code><dd>specifies a style for widgets based on the class name, or just the
class.

     <br><dt><code>widget_class</code><dd>specifies a style for widgets based on the class name. 
</dl>

<p class="noindent">See the previous subsection for examples of using the <code>widget</code>
command; the <code>widget_class</code> command is used similarly.  Note that
the widget name/class and the style must be enclosed in double-quotes,
and these commands must be at the top level in the GTK+ resource file.

   <p>As previously noted, you may specify a widget name or class with
shell wildcard syntax: `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' matches zero or more characters and
`<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>' matches one character.  This example assigns a style to all
widgets:

<pre class="smallexample">     widget "*" style "my_style"

<h4 class="appendixsubsec">D.5.3 GTK Widget Names in Emacs</h4>

<p><a name="index-GTK-widget-names-5054"></a><a name="index-GTK-widget-classes-5055"></a>
  The GTK+ widgets used by an Emacs frame are listed below:

     <dl>
<dt><code>Emacs</code> (class <code>GtkWindow</code>)<dd>
          <dl>
<dt><code>pane</code> (class <code>GtkVBox</code>)<dd>
               <dl>
<dt><code>menubar</code> (class <code>GtkMenuBar</code>)<dd>
                    <dl>
<dt>[menu item widgets]<dd></dl>
               <br><dt>[unnamed widget] (class <code>GtkHandleBox</code>)<dd>
                    <dl>
<dt><code>emacs-toolbar</code> (class <code>GtkToolbar</code>)<dd>
                         <dl>
<dt>[tool bar item widgets]<dd></dl>
                    </dl>
               <br><dt><code>emacs</code> (class <code>GtkFixed</code>)<dd>
                    <dl>
<dt><code>verticalScrollBar</code> (class <code>GtkVScrollbar</code>)<dd></dl>
               </dl>
          </dl>
     </dl>

<p class="noindent">The contents of Emacs windows are drawn in the <code>emacs</code> widget. 
Note that even if there are multiple Emacs windows, each scroll bar
widget is named <code>verticalScrollBar</code>.

   <p>For example, here are two different ways to set the menu bar style:

<pre class="smallexample">     widget "Emacs.pane.menubar.*" style "my_style"
     widget_class "GtkWindow.GtkVBox.GtkMenuBar.*" style "my_style"
</pre>
   <p>For GTK+ dialogs, Emacs uses a widget named <code>emacs-dialog</code>, of
class <code>GtkDialog</code>.  For file selection, Emacs uses a widget named
<code>emacs-filedialog</code>, of class <code>GtkFileSelection</code>.

   <p>Because the widgets for pop-up menus and dialogs are free-standing
windows and not contained in the <code>Emacs</code> widget, their GTK+
absolute names do not start with `<samp><span class="samp">Emacs</span></samp>'.  To customize these
widgets, use wildcards like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     widget "*emacs-dialog*" style "my_dialog_style"
     widget "*emacs-filedialog* style "my_file_style"
     widget "*emacs-menuitem* style "my_menu_style"
</pre>
   <p>If you want to apply a style to all menus in Emacs, use this:

<pre class="smallexample">     widget_class "*Menu*" style "my_menu_style"
</pre>

<h4 class="appendixsubsec">D.5.4 GTK styles</h4>

<p><a name="index-GTK-styles-5056"></a>
  Here is an example of two GTK+ style declarations:

<pre class="smallexample">     pixmap_path "/usr/share/pixmaps:/usr/include/X11/pixmaps"
     
     style "default"
     {
       font_name = "helvetica 12"
     
       bg[NORMAL] = { 0.83, 0.80, 0.73 }
       bg[SELECTED] = { 0.0, 0.55, 0.55 }
       bg[INSENSITIVE] = { 0.77, 0.77, 0.66 }
       bg[ACTIVE] = { 0.0, 0.55, 0.55 }
       bg[PRELIGHT] = { 0.0, 0.55, 0.55 }
     
       fg[NORMAL] = "black"
       fg[SELECTED] = { 0.9, 0.9, 0.9 }
       fg[ACTIVE] = "black"
       fg[PRELIGHT] = { 0.9, 0.9, 0.9 }
     
       base[INSENSITIVE] = "#777766"
       text[INSENSITIVE] = { 0.60, 0.65, 0.57 }
     
       bg_pixmap[NORMAL] = "background.xpm"
       bg_pixmap[INSENSITIVE] = "background.xpm"
       bg_pixmap[ACTIVE] = "background.xpm"
       bg_pixmap[PRELIGHT] = "&lt;none&gt;"
     
     }
     
     style "ruler" = "default"
     {
       font_name = "helvetica 8"
     }
     
</pre>
   <p>The style `<samp><span class="samp">ruler</span></samp>' inherits from `<samp><span class="samp">default</span></samp>'.  This way you can build
on existing styles.  The syntax for fonts and colors is described below.

   <p>As this example shows, it is possible to specify several values for
foreground and background depending on the widget's <dfn>state</dfn>.  The
possible states are:

     <dl>
<dt><code>NORMAL</code><dd>This is the default state for widgets. 
<br><dt><code>ACTIVE</code><dd>This is the state for a widget that is ready to do something.  It is
also for the trough of a scroll bar, i.e., <code>bg[ACTIVE] = "red"</code>
sets the scroll bar trough to red.  Buttons that have been armed
(pressed but not released yet) are in this state. 
<br><dt><code>PRELIGHT</code><dd>This is the state for a widget that can be manipulated, when the mouse
pointer is over it&mdash;for example when the mouse is over the thumb in
the scroll bar or over a menu item.  When the mouse is over a button
that is not pressed, the button is in this state. 
<br><dt><code>SELECTED</code><dd>This is the state for data that has been selected by the user.  It can
be selected text or items selected in a list.  This state is not used
in Emacs. 
<br><dt><code>INSENSITIVE</code><dd>This is the state for widgets that are visible, but they can not be
manipulated in the usual way&mdash;for example, buttons that can't be
pressed, and disabled menu items.  To display disabled menu items in
yellow, use <code>fg[INSENSITIVE] = "yellow"</code>. 
</dl>

   <p>Here are the things that can go in a style declaration:

     <dl>
<dt><code>bg[</code><var>state</var><code>] = </code><var>color</var><dd>This specifies the background color for the widget.  Note that
editable text doesn't use <code>bg</code>; it uses <code>base</code> instead.

     <br><dt><code>base[</code><var>state</var><code>] = </code><var>color</var><dd>This specifies the background color for editable text.  In Emacs, this
color is used for the background of the text fields in the file
dialog.

     <br><dt><code>bg_pixmap[</code><var>state</var><code>] = "</code><var>pixmap</var><code>"</code><dd>This specifies an image background (instead of a background color). 
<var>pixmap</var> should be the image file name.  GTK can use a number of
image file formats, including XPM, XBM, GIF, JPEG and PNG.  If you
want a widget to use the same image as its parent, use
`<samp><span class="samp">&lt;parent&gt;</span></samp>'.  If you don't want any image, use `<samp><span class="samp">&lt;none&gt;</span></samp>'. 
`<samp><span class="samp">&lt;none&gt;</span></samp>' is the way to cancel a background image inherited from a
parent style.

     <p>You can't specify the file by its absolute file name.  GTK looks for
the pixmap file in directories specified in <code>pixmap_path</code>. 
<code>pixmap_path</code> is a colon-separated list of directories within
double quotes, specified at the top level in a <samp><span class="file">gtkrc</span></samp> file
(i.e., not inside a style definition; see example above):

     <pre class="smallexample">          pixmap_path "/usr/share/pixmaps:/usr/include/X11/pixmaps"
     </pre>
     <br><dt><code>fg[</code><var>state</var><code>] = </code><var>color</var><dd>This specifies the foreground color for widgets to use.  It is the
color of text in menus and buttons, and the color for the arrows in
the scroll bar.  For editable text, use <code>text</code>.

     <br><dt><code>text[</code><var>state</var><code>] = </code><var>color</var><dd>This is the color for editable text.  In Emacs, this color is used for the
text fields in the file dialog.

     <br><dt><code>font_name = "</code><var>font</var><code>"</code><dd>This specifies the font for text in the widget.  <var>font</var> is a
GTK-style (or Pango) font name, like `<samp><span class="samp">Sans Italic 10</span></samp>'. 
See <a href="#Fonts">Fonts</a>.  The names are case insensitive. 
</dl>

   <p>There are three ways to specify a color: a color name, an RGB
triplet, or a GTK-style RGB triplet.  See <a href="#Colors">Colors</a>, for a description
of color names and RGB triplets.  Color names should be enclosed with
double quotes, e.g., `<samp><span class="samp">"red"</span></samp>'.  RGB triplets should be written
without double quotes, e.g., `<samp><span class="samp">#ff0000</span></samp>'.  GTK-style RGB triplets
have the form <code>{&nbsp;</code><var>r</var><code>,&nbsp;</code><var>g</var><code>,&nbsp;</code><var>b</var><code>&nbsp;}</code><!-- /@w -->, where
<var>r</var>, <var>g</var> and <var>b</var> are either integers in the range 0&ndash;65535
or floats in the range 0.0&ndash;1.0.

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix E Emacs 24 Antinews</h2>

<!-- Update the emacs.texi Antinews menu entry with the above version number. -->
<p>For those users who live backwards in time, here is information
about downgrading to Emacs version 24.5.  We hope you will enjoy the
greater simplicity that results from the absence of many Emacs
25.0.94 features.

     <ul>
<li>Support for Cairo drawing has been removed.  On GNU and Unix systems,
you now have only one drawing engine&mdash;the venerable X Window system. 
No need to procrastinate on the dilemma whether you do or don't want
the new shiny Cairo thing.  Hail, simplicity!

     <li>Emacs still works on SGI IRIX systems.  If you live backwards in time,
this is actually a bonus, as IRIX systems will become more and more
popular as you move farther back in time.

     <li>Support for dynamically loaded modules has been removed.  You get to
use only the trusted Emacs codebase, with no additions.  Those
external modules written by some J.R. Hacker cannot be trusted anyway. 
Good riddance!

     <li>We have greatly simplified the Emacs features which access the network
by removing the Network Security Manager.  No more annoying prompts
about trusting this or that site or page&mdash;you asked for it, you get
it, no questions asked!  You, the user, are now in charge of any
security issues related to sites whose certificates expired or didn't
exist in the first place.  Giving the user the utmost freedom was and
always will be the most important goal of Emacs development.  We keep
that goal even as we develop Emacs back in time.

     <li>We made the output of <kbd>C-h l</kbd> much simpler and easier to grasp by
removing the names of commands run by the recorded keystrokes.  True
Emacs lovers know their bindings by heart anyway, so why waste
precious screen estate on that which is well known?

     <li>Selection- and clipboard-related commands and variables got their
historical names back.  It's now the definitive
<code>x-select-enable-clipboard</code> again instead of the vague
<code>select-enable-clipboard</code>, and all those <code>gui-select-text</code>,
<code>gui-get-primary-selection</code>, etc. got their <code>x-*</code> names
back.  (What's a &ldquo;GUI&rdquo;, anyway?)  The only true window system with
selections is the X Window system, so we stopped pretending that other
platforms have anything similar to that.  You now know when you invoke
a command that accesses X.

     <li>Passwords are no longer hidden when typed in <code>-batch</code> mode.  It
was a misfeature to have it not shown in the first place: who can type
without seeing what they type?  We couldn't convince the users of GUI
sessions to give up hiding the password, so we at least made it
visible in batch mode, which is something every veteran Emacs user
uses all the time.  Stay tuned for un-hiding the password in GUI
sessions as well as we downgrade progressively to previous Emacs
versions.

     <li>The nuisance with Unicode characters popping up all over the place has
been amply dealt with.  We've removed <kbd>C-x 8</kbd> shorthands for
characters such as ‘, ’, “, ”, €, ≤, and many others; as a nice
benefit, this removes many useless entries at the beginning of the
<kbd>C-h b</kbd> output.  The <code>electric-quote-mode</code> has been deleted,
so there's only the one true quoting method now&mdash;using the
plain-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> quote characters.  And if that's not enough, the
doc strings and other messages show text quoted <tt>`like this'</tt>
as they were written, instead of arbitrarily replacing them
with Unicode &ldquo;curved quote&rdquo; characters <tt>‘like this’</tt>.  The
<code>text-quoting-style</code> variable becomes therefore unneeded and was
removed.  As result, text produced by Emacs can be sent to those
venerable teletypes again, yeah!

     <p>For the same reasons, the character classes <code>[:alpha:]</code> and
<code>[:alnum:]</code> again match any word-constituent character, and
<code>[:graph:]</code> and <code>[:print:]</code> match every multibyte character. 
Confusing use of Unicode character properties is gone.

     <li>I-search and query-replace no longer try to confuse you by using the
&ldquo;character-folding&rdquo; magic.  They will no longer find any characters
you didn't actually type, like find <kbd>ⓐ</kbd> when you actually typed
<kbd>a</kbd>.  Users who want to find some fancy character will have to
type it explicitly.

     <li>The <samp><span class="file">desktop.el</span></samp> package no longer records window and frame
configuration, and doesn't attempt to restore them.  You now have back
your freedom of re-arranging your windows and frames anew each time
you restore a session.  This made the new backward-incompatible format
of the <samp><span class="file">.emacs.desktop</span></samp> file unnecessary, so the format was
reverted back to what it was before Emacs 25.  You can now again use
the desktop file with all the previous versions of Emacs.

     <li>We have reworked the Prettify Symbols mode to support only the default
<code>prettify-symbols-compose-predicate</code>.  No need to consider
whether your major or minor mode needs its own prettifications; just
use what came with Emacs.  We also removed the
<code>prettify-symbols-unprettify-at-point</code> option: once prettified,
always prettified!  These changes make the Prettify Symbols mode quite
a lot simpler and easier to use.

     <li>Support for nifty new features of xterm, such as access to the X
selection and the clipboard, the &ldquo;bracketed paste mode&rdquo;, and other
advanced capabilities has been removed.  When you kill text in an
xterm Emacs session, that text is only saved in the Emacs kill ring,
without letting other applications have any way of accessing it.  An
xterm is just a text terminal, nothing more, nothing less.  There
should be no feature we support on xterm that isn't supported on bare
console terminals.  For the same reasons, support for mouse-tracking
on xterm was removed.  We will continue this line of simplifications
as we downgrade to previous versions of Emacs; stay tuned.

     <li>Various features in <samp><span class="file">package.el</span></samp> have been simplified.  The
&ldquo;external&rdquo; package status is no longer available.  A package present
on multiple archives will now be listed as many times as it is found:
we don't believe in concealing any information from the users.  This
and other similar simplifications made
<code>package-menu-toggle-hiding</code> unnecessary, since there's nothing
to unhide now.

     <li>The <kbd>&lt;UP&gt;</kbd> and <kbd>&lt;DOWN&gt;</kbd> keys in the minibuffer have
been simplified to move by history items.  No need to wonder whether
you have moved to the next/previous item or to another line within the
same item.  Well-written commands shouldn't allow too long history
entries anyway; be sure to report any that do as bugs, so that we
could fix them in past versions of Emacs.

     <li>The VC mode was simplified by removing the support for &ldquo;push&rdquo;
commands.  Moving back in time means you will have less and less need
to use modern version control systems such as Git, Bazaar, and
Mercurial, so the necessity of using &ldquo;push&rdquo; commands will gradually
disappear.  We removed it from Emacs in advance, so that you won't
need to un-learn it when this command disappears, as it should.

     <li>The support for full C/C++ expressions in macros has been removed from
Hide-Ifdef mode.  It now supports only the basic literal macros.  As
result, the user interface was simplified, and a number of useless
commands have been removed from Hide-Ifdef mode.  Further
simplifications were made possible by removing support for some fancy
new preprocessor directives, such as <code>#if defined</code>, <code>#elif</code>,
etc.

     <li>We have reverted to Etags for looking up definitions of functions,
variables, etc.  Commands such as <kbd>M-.</kbd> use tags tables, as they
always have.  This allowed the removal of the entire <samp><span class="file">xref.el</span></samp>
package and its many metastases in the other Emacs packages and
commands, significantly simplifying those.  No more complexities with
the various &ldquo;backends&rdquo; that provide incoherent behavior that is hard
to explain and remember; either the symbol is in TAGS or it isn't.  No
more new user interfaces we never before saw in Emacs, either; if you
want the next definition for the symbol you typed, just invoke
<kbd>C-u M-.</kbd>&mdash;what could be simpler?  As a nice side effect, you get
to use your beloved <code>tags-loop-continue</code> and <code>pop-tag-mark</code>
commands and their memorable bindings.  The <samp><span class="file">package.el</span></samp> package
has been removed for similar reasons.

     <li><code>(/ </code><var>n</var><code>)</code> once again yields just <var>n</var>.  Emacs Lisp is not
Common Lisp, so compatibility with CL just complicates Emacs here.

     <li>The functions <code>filepos-to-bufferpos</code> and
<code>bufferpos-to-filepos</code> have been removed.  Code that needs to
find a file position by a buffer position or vice versa should adapt
by reading the file with no conversions and counting bytes while
comparing text.  How hard can that be?

     <li>We saw no need for the <code>make-process</code> primitive, so we removed
it.  The <code>start-process</code> primitive provides all the functionality
one needs, so adding more APIs just confuses users.

     <li>The functions <code>bidi-find-overridden-directionality</code> and
<code>buffer-substring-with-bidi-context</code> were removed, in preparation
for removing the whole bidi support when downgrading to Emacs 23.

     <li>Horizontal scroll bars are no longer supported.  Enlarge your windows
and frames instead, or use <code>truncate-lines</code> and the automatic
horizontal scrolling of text that Emacs had since time immemorial.

     <li>Emacs is again counting the height of a frame's menu and its tool bar
in the frame's text height calculations.  This makes Emacs invocation
on different platforms and with different toolkits less predictable
when frame geometry parameters are given on the Emacs command line,
thus making Emacs more adventurous and less boring to use.

     <li>The <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp> program no longer supports Ruby and Go languages. 
You won't need that as you progressively travel back in time towards
the time before these languages were invented.  We removed support for
them in anticipation for that time.

     <li>To keep up with decreasing computer memory capacity and disk space, many
other functions and files have been eliminated in Emacs 24.5.

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix F Emacs and Mac OS / GNUstep</h2>

<p><a name="index-Mac-OS-X-5057"></a><a name="index-Macintosh-5058"></a><a name="index-GNUstep-5059"></a>
  This section describes the peculiarities of using Emacs built with
the GNUstep libraries on GNU/Linux or other operating systems, or on
Mac OS X with native window system support.  On Mac OS X, Emacs can be
built either without window system support, with X11, or with the
Cocoa interface; this section only applies to the Cocoa build.  This
does not support versions of Mac OS X earlier than 10.6.

   <p>For various historical and technical reasons, Emacs uses the term
`<samp><span class="samp">Nextstep</span></samp>' internally, instead of &ldquo;Cocoa&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mac OS X&rdquo;; for
instance, most of the commands and variables described in this section
begin with `<samp><span class="samp">ns-</span></samp>', which is short for `<samp><span class="samp">Nextstep</span></samp>'.  NeXTstep
was an application interface released by NeXT Inc during the 1980s, of
which Cocoa is a direct descendant.  Apart from Cocoa, there is
another NeXTstep-style system: GNUstep, which is free software.  As of
this writing, Emacs GNUstep support is alpha status (see <a href="#GNUstep-Support">GNUstep Support</a>), but we hope to improve it in the future.

</div>

<h3 class="section">F.1 Basic Emacs usage under Mac OS and GNUstep</h3>

<p>By default, the &lt;alt&gt; and &lt;option&gt; keys are the same as
&lt;Meta&gt;.  The Mac &lt;Cmd&gt; key is the same as &lt;Super&gt;, and
Emacs provides a set of key bindings using this modifier key that mimic
other Mac / GNUstep applications (see <a href="#Mac-_002f-GNUstep-Events">Mac / GNUstep Events</a>).  You
can change these bindings in the usual way (see <a href="#Key-Bindings">Key Bindings</a>).

   <p><a name="index-ns_002dalternate_002dmodifier-5060"></a><a name="index-ns_002dright_002dalternate_002dmodifier-5061"></a>  The variable <code>ns-right-alternate-modifier</code> controls the
behavior of the right &lt;alt&gt; and &lt;option&gt; keys.  These keys
behave like the left-hand keys if the value is <code>left</code> (the
default).  A value of <code>control</code>, <code>meta</code>, <code>alt</code>,
<code>super</code>, or <code>hyper</code> makes them behave like the corresponding
modifier keys; a value to <code>left</code> means be the same key as
<code>ns-alternate-modifier</code>; a value of <code>none</code> tells Emacs to
ignore them.

   <p><kbd>S-mouse-1</kbd> adjusts the region to the click position,
just like <kbd>mouse-3</kbd> (<code>mouse-save-then-kill</code>); it does not pop
up a menu for changing the default face, as <kbd>S-mouse-1</kbd> normally
does (see <a href="#Text-Scale">Text Scale</a>).  This change makes Emacs behave more like
other Mac / GNUstep applications.

   <p>When you open or save files using the menus, or using the
<kbd>Cmd-o</kbd> and <kbd>Cmd-S</kbd> bindings, Emacs uses graphical file
dialogs to read file names.  However, if you use the regular Emacs key
sequences, such as <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>, Emacs uses the minibuffer to read
file names.

   <p>On GNUstep, in an X-windows environment you need to use <kbd>Cmd-c</kbd>
instead of one of the <kbd>C-w</kbd> or <kbd>M-w</kbd> commands to transfer text
to the X primary selection; otherwise, Emacs will use the
clipboard selection.  Likewise, <kbd>Cmd-y</kbd> (instead of <kbd>C-y</kbd>)
yanks from the X primary selection instead of the kill-ring or
clipboard.

<h4 class="subsection">F.1.1 Grabbing environment variables</h4>

<!-- How is this any different to launching from a window manager menu -->
<!-- in GNU/Linux?  These are sometimes not login shells either. -->
<p>Many programs which may run under Emacs, like latex or man, depend on the
settings of environment variables.  If Emacs is launched from the shell, it
will automatically inherit these environment variables and its subprocesses
will inherit them from it.  But if Emacs is launched from the Finder it
is not a descendant of any shell, so its environment variables haven't been
set, which often causes the subprocesses it launches to behave differently than
they would when launched from the shell.

   <p>For the PATH and MANPATH variables, a system-wide method
of setting PATH is recommended on Mac OS X, using the
<samp><span class="file">/etc/paths</span></samp> files and the <samp><span class="file">/etc/paths.d</span></samp> directory.

</div>

<h3 class="section">F.2 Mac / GNUstep Customization</h3>

<p>There are a few customization options that are specific to the
Nextstep port.  For example, they affect things such as the modifier
keys and the fullscreen behavior.  To see all such options, use
<kbd>M-x customize-group &lt;RET&gt; ns &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.

<h4 class="subsection">F.2.1 Font and Color Panels</h4>

<p>The standard Mac / GNUstep font and color panels are accessible via
Lisp commands.  The Font Panel may be accessed with <kbd>M-x
ns-popup-font-panel</kbd>.  It will set the default font in the frame most
recently used or clicked on.

<!-- To make the setting permanent, use @samp{Save Options} in the -->
<!-- Options menu, or run @code{menu-bar-options-save}. -->
<p>You can bring up a color panel with <kbd>M-x ns-popup-color-panel</kbd> and
drag the color you want over the Emacs face you want to change.  Normal
dragging will alter the foreground color.  Shift dragging will alter the
background color.  To discard the settings, create a new frame and
close the altered one.

<!-- To make the changes permanent select the "Save Options" -->
<!-- item in the "Options" menu, or run @code{menu-bar-options-save}. -->
<p>Useful in this context is the listing of all faces obtained by
<kbd>M-x list-faces-display</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-Core-Text_002c-on-Mac-OS-X-5062"></a>In Mac OS X, Emacs uses a Core Text based font backend
by default.  If you prefer the older font style, enter the following
at the command-line before starting Emacs:

<pre class="example">     % defaults write org.gnu.Emacs FontBackend ns

<h3 class="section">F.3 Windowing System Events under Mac OS / GNUstep</h3>

<p>Nextstep applications receive a number of special events which have
no X equivalent.  These are sent as specially defined key events, which
do not correspond to any sequence of keystrokes.  Under Emacs, these
key events can be bound to functions just like ordinary
keystrokes.  Here is a list of these events.

     <dl>
<dt>&lt;ns-open-file&gt;<dd><a name="index-ns_002dpop_002dup_002dframes-5063"></a>This event occurs when another Nextstep application requests that
Emacs open a file.  A typical reason for this would be a user
double-clicking a file in the Finder application.  By default, Emacs
responds to this event by opening a new frame and visiting the file in
that frame (<code>ns-find-file</code>).  As an exception, if the selected
buffer is the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer, Emacs visits the file in the
selected frame.

     <p>You can change how Emacs responds to a <code>ns-open-file</code> event by
changing the variable <code>ns-pop-up-frames</code>.  Its default value,
`<samp><span class="samp">fresh</span></samp>', is what we have just described.  A value of <code>t</code>
means to always visit the file in a new frame.  A value of <code>nil</code>
means to always visit the file in an existing frame.

     <br><dt>&lt;ns-open-temp-file&gt;<dd>This event occurs when another application requests that Emacs open a
temporary file.  By default, this is handled by just generating a
<code>ns-open-file</code> event, the results of which are described above.

     <br><dt>&lt;ns-open-file-line&gt;<dd>Some applications, such as ProjectBuilder and gdb, request not only a
particular file, but also a particular line or sequence of lines in
the file.  Emacs handles this by visiting that file and highlighting
the requested line (<code>ns-open-file-select-line</code>).

     <br><dt>&lt;ns-drag-file&gt;<dd>This event occurs when a user drags files from another application
into an Emacs frame.  The default behavior is to insert the contents
of all the dragged files into the current buffer
(<code>ns-insert-files</code>).  The list of dragged files is stored in the
variable <code>ns-input-file</code>.

     <br><dt>&lt;ns-drag-color&gt;<dd>This event occurs when a user drags a color from the color well (or
some other source) into an Emacs frame.  The default behavior is to
alter the foreground color of the area the color was dragged onto
(<code>ns-set-foreground-at-mouse</code>).  If this event is issued with a
&lt;Shift&gt; modifier, Emacs changes the background color instead
(<code>ns-set-background-at-mouse</code>).  The name of the dragged color is
stored in the variable <code>ns-input-color</code>.

     <br><dt>&lt;ns-change-font&gt;<dd>This event occurs when the user selects a font in a Nextstep font
panel (which can be opened with <kbd>Cmd-t</kbd>).  The default behavior is
to adjust the font of the selected frame
(<code>ns-respond-to-changefont</code>).  The name and size of the selected
font are stored in the variables <code>ns-input-font</code> and
<code>ns-input-fontsize</code>, respectively.

     <br><dt>&lt;ns-power-off&gt;<dd>This event occurs when the user logs out and Emacs is still running, or when
&ldquo;Quit Emacs&rdquo; is chosen from the application menu. 
The default behavior is to save all file-visiting buffers. 
</dl>

   <p>Emacs also allows users to make use of Nextstep services, via a set
of commands whose names begin with `<samp><span class="samp">ns-service-</span></samp>' and end with the
name of the service.  Type <kbd>M-x ns-service-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> to
see a list of these commands.  These functions either operate on
marked text (replacing it with the result) or take a string argument
and return the result as a string.  You can also use the Lisp function
<code>ns-perform-service</code> to pass arbitrary strings to arbitrary
services and receive the results back.  Note that you may need to
restart Emacs to access newly-available services.

<h3 class="section">G.1 How to Start Emacs on MS-Windows</h3>

<p><a name="index-starting-Emacs-on-MS_002dWindows-5066"></a>
  There are several ways of starting Emacs on MS-Windows:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li><a name="index-runemacs_002eexe-5067"></a><a name="index-desktop-shortcut_002c-MS_002dWindows-5068"></a><a name="index-start-directory_002c-MS_002dWindows-5069"></a><a name="index-directory-where-Emacs-starts-on-MS_002dWindows-5070"></a>From the desktop shortcut icon: either double-click the left mouse
button on the icon, or click once, then press &lt;RET&gt;.  The desktop
shortcut should specify as its &ldquo;Target&rdquo; (in the &ldquo;Properties&rdquo; of
the shortcut) the full absolute file name of <samp><span class="file">runemacs.exe</span></samp>,
<em>not</em> of <samp><span class="file">emacs.exe</span></samp>.  This is because <samp><span class="file">runemacs.exe</span></samp>
hides the console window that would have been created if the target of
the shortcut were <samp><span class="file">emacs.exe</span></samp> (which is a console program, as far
as Windows is concerned).  If you use this method, Emacs starts in the
directory specified by the shortcut.  To control where that is,
right-click on the shortcut, select &ldquo;Properties&rdquo;, and in the
&ldquo;Shortcut&rdquo; tab modify the &ldquo;Start in&rdquo; field to your liking.

     <li>From the Command Prompt window, by typing <kbd>emacs &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> at the
prompt.  The Command Prompt window where you did that will not be
available for invoking other commands until Emacs exits.  In this
case, Emacs will start in the current directory of the Windows shell.

     <li>From the Command Prompt window, by typing <kbd>runemacs &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> at
the prompt.  The Command Prompt window where you did that will be
immediately available for invoking other commands.  In this case,
Emacs will start in the current directory of the Windows shell.

     <li><a name="index-invoking-Emacs-from-Windows-Explorer-5071"></a><a name="index-emacsclient_002eexe-5072"></a><a name="index-emacsclientw_002eexe-5073"></a>Via <samp><span class="file">emacsclient.exe</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">emacsclientw.exe</span></samp>, which allow you
to invoke Emacs from other programs, and to reuse a running Emacs
process for serving editing jobs required by other programs. 
See <a href="#Emacs-Server">Emacs Server</a>.  The difference between <samp><span class="file">emacsclient.exe</span></samp>
and <samp><span class="file">emacsclientw.exe</span></samp> is that the former is a console program,
while the latter is a Windows GUI program.  Both programs wait for
Emacs to signal that the editing job is finished, before they exit and
return control to the program that invoked them.  Which one of them to
use in each case depends on the expectations of the program that needs
editing services.  If that program is itself a console (text-mode)
program, you should use <samp><span class="file">emacsclient.exe</span></samp>, so that any of its
messages and prompts appear in the same command window as those of the
invoking program.  By contrast, if the invoking program is a GUI
program, you will be better off using <samp><span class="file">emacsclientw.exe</span></samp>, because
<samp><span class="file">emacsclient.exe</span></samp> will pop up a command window if it is invoked
from a GUI program.  A notable situation where you would want
<samp><span class="file">emacsclientw.exe</span></samp> is when you right-click on a file in the
Windows Explorer and select &ldquo;Open With&rdquo; from the pop-up menu.  Use
the `<samp><span class="samp">--alternate-editor=</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">-a</span></samp>' options if Emacs might not
be running (or not running as a server) when <samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp> is
invoked&mdash;that will always give you an editor.  When invoked via
<samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp>, Emacs will start in the current directory of
the program that invoked <samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp>.
        </ol>

   <p><a name="index-emacsclient_002c-on-MS_002dWindows-5074"></a>Note that, due to limitations of MS-Windows, Emacs cannot have both
GUI and text-mode frames in the same session.  It also cannot open
text-mode frames on more than a single <dfn>Command Prompt</dfn> window,
because each Windows program can have only one console at any given
time.  For these reasons, if you invoke <samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp> with the
<samp><span class="option">-c</span></samp> option, and the Emacs server runs in a text-mode session,
Emacs will always create a new text-mode frame in the same
<dfn>Command Prompt</dfn> window where it was started; a GUI frame will be
created only if the server runs in a GUI session.  Similarly, if you
invoke <samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp> with the <samp><span class="option">-t</span></samp> option, Emacs will
create a GUI frame if the server runs in a GUI session, or a text-mode
frame when the session runs in text mode in a <dfn>Command Prompt</dfn>
window.  See <a href="#emacsclient-Options">emacsclient Options</a>.

<h3 class="section">G.2 Text Files and Binary Files</h3>

<p><a name="index-text-and-binary-files-on-MS_002dDOS_002fMS_002dWindows-5075"></a>
  GNU Emacs uses newline characters to separate text lines.  This is the
convention used on GNU, Unix, and other Posix-compliant systems.

   <p><a name="index-end_002dof_002dline-conversion-on-MS_002dDOS_002fMS_002dWindows-5076"></a>  By contrast, MS-DOS and MS-Windows normally use carriage-return linefeed,
a two-character sequence, to separate text lines.  (Linefeed is the same
character as newline.)  Therefore, convenient editing of typical files
with Emacs requires conversion of these end-of-line (EOL) sequences. 
And that is what Emacs normally does: it converts carriage-return
linefeed into newline when reading files, and converts newline into
carriage-return linefeed when writing files.  The same mechanism that
handles conversion of international character codes does this conversion
also (see <a href="#Coding-Systems">Coding Systems</a>).

   <p><a name="index-cursor-location_002c-on-MS_002dDOS-5077"></a><a name="index-point-location_002c-on-MS_002dDOS-5078"></a>  One consequence of this special format-conversion of most files is
that character positions as reported by Emacs (see <a href="#Position-Info">Position Info</a>) do
not agree with the file size information known to the operating system.

   <p>In addition, if Emacs recognizes from a file's contents that it uses
newline rather than carriage-return linefeed as its line separator, it
does not perform EOL conversion when reading or writing that file. 
Thus, you can read and edit files from GNU and Unix systems on MS-DOS
with no special effort, and they will retain their Unix-style
end-of-line convention after you edit them.

   <p>The mode line indicates whether end-of-line translation was used for
the current buffer.  If MS-DOS end-of-line translation is in use for the
buffer, the MS-Windows build of Emacs displays a backslash `<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>' after
the coding system mnemonic near the beginning of the mode line
(see <a href="#Mode-Line">Mode Line</a>).  If no EOL translation was performed, the string
`<samp><span class="samp">(Unix)</span></samp>' is displayed instead of the backslash, to alert you that the
file's EOL format is not the usual carriage-return linefeed.

   <p><a name="index-DOS_002dto_002dUnix-conversion-of-files-5079"></a>  To visit a file and specify whether it uses DOS-style or Unix-style
end-of-line, specify a coding system (see <a href="#Text-Coding">Text Coding</a>).  For
example, <kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt; c unix &lt;RET&gt; C-x C-f foobar.txt</kbd>
visits the file <samp><span class="file">foobar.txt</span></samp> without converting the EOLs; if some
line ends with a carriage-return linefeed pair, Emacs will display
`<samp><span class="samp">^M</span></samp>' at the end of that line.  Similarly, you can direct Emacs to
save a buffer in a specified EOL format with the <kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt; f</kbd>
command.  For example, to save a buffer with Unix EOL format, type
<kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt; f unix &lt;RET&gt; C-x C-s</kbd>.  If you visit a file
with DOS EOL conversion, then save it with Unix EOL format, that
effectively converts the file to Unix EOL style, like the
<code>dos2unix</code> program.

   <p><a name="index-untranslated-file-system-5080"></a><a name="index-add_002duntranslated_002dfilesystem-5081"></a>  When you use NFS, Samba, or some other similar method to access file
systems that reside on computers using GNU or Unix systems, Emacs
should not perform end-of-line translation on any files in these file
systems&mdash;not even when you create a new file.  To request this,
designate these file systems as <dfn>untranslated</dfn> file systems by
calling the function <code>add-untranslated-filesystem</code>.  It takes one
argument: the file system name, including a drive letter and
optionally a directory.  For example,

<pre class="example">     (add-untranslated-filesystem "Z:")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">designates drive Z as an untranslated file system, and

<pre class="example">     (add-untranslated-filesystem "Z:\\foo")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">designates directory <samp><span class="file">\foo</span></samp> on drive Z as an untranslated file
system.

   <p>Most often you would use <code>add-untranslated-filesystem</code> in your
<samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file, or in <samp><span class="file">site-start.el</span></samp> so that all the users at
your site get the benefit of it.

   <p><a name="index-remove_002duntranslated_002dfilesystem-5082"></a>  To countermand the effect of <code>add-untranslated-filesystem</code>, use
the function <code>remove-untranslated-filesystem</code>.  This function takes
one argument, which should be a string just like the one that was used
previously with <code>add-untranslated-filesystem</code>.

   <p>Designating a file system as untranslated does not affect character
set conversion, only end-of-line conversion.  Essentially, it directs
Emacs to create new files with the Unix-style convention of using
newline at the end of a line.  See <a href="#Coding-Systems">Coding Systems</a>.

<h3 class="section">G.3 File Names on MS-Windows</h3>

<p><a name="index-file-names-on-MS_002dWindows-5083"></a>
  MS-Windows and MS-DOS normally use a backslash, `<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>', to
separate name units within a file name, instead of the slash used on
other systems.  Emacs on MS-DOS/MS-Windows permits use of either slash or
backslash, and also knows about drive letters in file names.

   <p><a name="index-file_002dname-completion_002c-on-MS_002dWindows-5084"></a>  On MS-DOS/MS-Windows, file names are case-insensitive, so Emacs by
default ignores letter-case in file names during completion.

   <p><a name="index-w32_002dget_002dtrue_002dfile_002dattributes-5085"></a>  The variable <code>w32-get-true-file-attributes</code> controls whether
Emacs should issue additional system calls to determine more
accurately file attributes in primitives like <code>file-attributes</code>
and <code>directory-files-and-attributes</code>.  These additional calls are
needed to report correct file ownership, link counts and file types
for special files such as pipes.  Without these system calls, file
ownership will be attributed to the current user, link counts will be
always reported as 1, and special files will be reported as regular
files.

   <p>If the value of this variable is <code>local</code> (the default), Emacs
will issue these additional system calls only for files on local fixed
drives.  Any other non-<code>nil</code> value means do this even for
removable and remote volumes, where this could potentially slow down
Dired and other related features.  The value of <code>nil</code> means never
issue those system calls.  Non-<code>nil</code> values are more useful on
NTFS volumes, which support hard links and file security, than on FAT,
FAT32, and exFAT volumes.

   <p><a name="index-file-names_002c-invalid-characters-on-MS_002dWindows-5086"></a>  Unlike Unix, MS-Windows file systems restrict the set of characters
that can be used in a file name.  The following characters are not
allowed:

     <ul>
<li>Shell redirection symbols `<samp><span class="samp">&lt;</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>', and `<samp><span class="samp">|</span></samp>'.

     <li>Colon `<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>' (except after the drive letter).

     <li>Forward slash `<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>' and backslash `<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>' (except as directory
separators).

     <li>Wildcard characters `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>'.

     <li>Control characters whose codepoints are 1 through 31 decimal.  In
particular, newlines in file names are not allowed.

     <li>The null character, whose codepoint is zero (this limitation exists on
Unix filesystems as well). 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">In addition, referencing any file whose name matches a DOS character
device, such as <samp><span class="file">NUL</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">LPT1</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">PRN</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">CON</span></samp>,
with or without any file-name extension, will always resolve to those
character devices, in any directory.  Therefore, only use such file
names when you want to use the corresponding character device.

<h3 class="section">G.4 Emulation of <code>ls</code> on MS-Windows</h3>

<p><a name="index-Dired_002c-and-MS_002dWindows_002fMS_002dDOS-5087"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bls_007d-emulation-5088"></a>
  Dired normally uses the external program <code>ls</code>
to produce the directory listing displayed in Dired
buffers (see <a href="#Dired">Dired</a>).  However, MS-Windows and MS-DOS systems don't
come with such a program, although several ports of <span class="sc">gnu</span> <code>ls</code>
are available.  Therefore, Emacs on those systems <em>emulates</em>
<code>ls</code> in Lisp, by using the <samp><span class="file">ls-lisp.el</span></samp> package.  While
<samp><span class="file">ls-lisp.el</span></samp> provides a reasonably full emulation of <code>ls</code>,
there are some options and features peculiar to that emulation;
they are described in this section.

   <p>The <code>ls</code> emulation supports many of the <code>ls</code> switches, but
it doesn't support all of them.  Here's the list of the switches it
does support: <samp><span class="option">-A</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-a</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-B</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-C</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-c</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-G</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-g</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-h</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-i</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-n</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-R</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-r</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-S</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-s</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-t</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-U</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-u</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="option">-X</span></samp>.  The <samp><span class="option">-F</span></samp> switch is partially
supported (it appends the character that classifies the file, but does
not prevent symlink following).

   <p><a name="index-ls_002dlisp_002duse_002dinsert_002ddirectory_002dprogram-5089"></a>  On MS-Windows and MS-DOS, <samp><span class="file">ls-lisp.el</span></samp> is preloaded when Emacs
is built, so the Lisp emulation of <code>ls</code> is always used on those
platforms.  If you have a ported <code>ls</code>, setting
<code>ls-lisp-use-insert-directory-program</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> value
will revert to using an external program named by the variable
<code>insert-directory-program</code>.

   <p><a name="index-ls_002dlisp_002dignore_002dcase-5090"></a>  By default, <samp><span class="file">ls-lisp.el</span></samp> uses a case-sensitive sort order for
the directory listing it produces; this is so the listing looks the
same as on other platforms.  If you wish that the files be sorted in
case-insensitive order, set the variable <code>ls-lisp-ignore-case</code> to
a non-<code>nil</code> value.

   <p><a name="index-ls_002dlisp_002ddirs_002dfirst-5091"></a>  By default, files and subdirectories are sorted together, to emulate
the behavior of <code>ls</code>.  However, native MS-Windows/MS-DOS file
managers list the directories before the files; if you want that
behavior, customize the option <code>ls-lisp-dirs-first</code> to a
non-<code>nil</code> value.

   <p><a name="index-ls_002dlisp_002dverbosity-5092"></a>  The variable <code>ls-lisp-verbosity</code> controls the file attributes
that <samp><span class="file">ls-lisp.el</span></samp> displays.  The value should be a list that
contains one or more of the symbols <code>links</code>, <code>uid</code>, and
<code>gid</code>.  <code>links</code> means display the count of different file
names that are associated with (a.k.a. <dfn>links to</dfn>) the file's
data; this is only useful on NTFS volumes.  <code>uid</code> means display
the numerical identifier of the user who owns the file.  <code>gid</code>
means display the numerical identifier of the file owner's group.  The
default value is <code>(links uid gid)</code> i.e., all the 3 optional
attributes are displayed.

   <p><a name="index-ls_002dlisp_002demulation-5093"></a>  The variable <code>ls-lisp-emulation</code> controls the flavor of the
<code>ls</code> emulation by setting the defaults for the 3 options
described above: <code>ls-lisp-ignore-case</code>,
<code>ls-lisp-dirs-first</code>, and <code>ls-lisp-verbosity</code>.  The value of
this option can be one of the following symbols:

     <dl>
<dt><code>GNU</code><dt><code>nil</code><dd>Emulate <span class="sc">gnu</span> systems; this is the default.  This sets
<code>ls-lisp-ignore-case</code> and <code>ls-lisp-dirs-first</code> to
<code>nil</code>, and <code>ls-lisp-verbosity</code> to <code>(links uid gid)</code>. 
<br><dt><code>UNIX</code><dd>Emulate Unix systems.  Like <code>GNU</code>, but sets
<code>ls-lisp-verbosity</code> to <code>(links uid)</code>. 
<br><dt><code>MacOS</code><dd>Emulate MacOS.  Sets <code>ls-lisp-ignore-case</code> to <code>t</code>, and
<code>ls-lisp-dirs-first</code> and <code>ls-lisp-verbosity</code> to <code>nil</code>. 
<br><dt><code>MS-Windows</code><dd>Emulate MS-Windows.  Sets <code>ls-lisp-ignore-case</code> and
<code>ls-lisp-dirs-first</code> to <code>t</code>, and <code>ls-lisp-verbosity</code> to
<code>(links)</code> on Windows NT/2K/XP/2K3 and to <code>nil</code> on Windows 9X. 
Note that the default emulation is <em>not</em> <code>MS-Windows</code>, even
on Windows, since many users of Emacs on those platforms prefer the
<span class="sc">gnu</span> defaults. 
</dl>

<p class="noindent">Any other value of <code>ls-lisp-emulation</code> means the same as <code>GNU</code>. 
Customizing this option calls the function <code>ls-lisp-set-options</code> to
update the 3 dependent options as needed.  If you change the value of
this variable without using customize after <samp><span class="file">ls-lisp.el</span></samp> is loaded
(note that it is preloaded on MS-Windows and MS-DOS), you can call that
function manually for the same result.

   <p><a name="index-ls_002dlisp_002dsupport_002dshell_002dwildcards-5094"></a>  The variable <code>ls-lisp-support-shell-wildcards</code> controls how
file-name patterns are supported: if it is non-<code>nil</code> (the
default), they are treated as shell-style wildcards; otherwise they
are treated as Emacs regular expressions.

   <p><a name="index-ls_002dlisp_002dformat_002dtime_002dlist-5095"></a>  The variable <code>ls-lisp-format-time-list</code> defines how to format
the date and time of files.  <em>The value of this variable is
ignored</em>, unless Emacs cannot determine the current locale.  (However,
if the value of <code>ls-lisp-use-localized-time-format</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>, Emacs obeys <code>ls-lisp-format-time-list</code> even if
the current locale is available; see below.)

   <p>The value of <code>ls-lisp-format-time-list</code> is a list of 2 strings. 
The first string is used if the file was modified within the current
year, while the second string is used for older files.  In each of
these two strings you can use `<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>'-sequences to substitute parts
of the time.  For example:
<pre class="lisp">     ("%b %e %H:%M" "%b %e  %Y")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Note that the strings substituted for these `<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>'-sequences depend
on the current locale.  See <a href="elisp.html#Time-Parsing">Time Parsing</a>, for more about format time specs.

   <p><a name="index-ls_002dlisp_002duse_002dlocalized_002dtime_002dformat-5096"></a>  Normally, Emacs formats the file time stamps in either traditional
or ISO-style time format.  However, if the value of the variable
<code>ls-lisp-use-localized-time-format</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, Emacs
formats file time stamps according to what
<code>ls-lisp-format-time-list</code> specifies.  The `<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>'-sequences in
<code>ls-lisp-format-time-list</code> produce locale-dependent month and day
names, which might cause misalignment of columns in Dired display.

<h3 class="section">G.5 HOME and Startup Directories on MS-Windows</h3>

<p><a name="index-HOME-directory-on-MS_002dWindows-5097"></a>
  The Windows equivalent of <code>HOME</code> is the <dfn>user-specific
application data directory</dfn>.  The actual location depends on the
Windows version; typical values are <samp><span class="file">C:\Documents and
Settings\</span><var>username</var><span class="file">\Application Data</span></samp> on Windows 2000/XP/2K3,
<samp><span class="file">C:\Users\</span><var>username</var><span class="file">\AppData\Roaming</span></samp> on Windows
Vista/7/2008, and either <samp><span class="file">C:\WINDOWS\Application Data</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="file">C:\WINDOWS\Profiles\</span><var>username</var><span class="file">\Application Data</span></samp> on Windows
9X/ME.  If this directory does not exist or cannot be accessed, Emacs
falls back to <samp><span class="file">C:\</span></samp> as the default value of <code>HOME</code>.

   <p>You can override this default value of <code>HOME</code> by explicitly
setting the environment variable <samp><span class="env">HOME</span></samp> to point to any directory
on your system.  <samp><span class="env">HOME</span></samp> can be set either from the command shell
prompt or from `<samp><span class="samp">Properties</span></samp>' dialog of `<samp><span class="samp">My Computer</span></samp>'. 
<code>HOME</code> can also be set in the system registry,
see <a href="#MS_002dWindows-Registry">MS-Windows Registry</a>.

   <p>For compatibility with older versions of Emacs<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-23" name="fnd-23"><sup>23</sup></a>, if there is a file named <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> in <samp><span class="file">C:\</span></samp>, the root
directory of drive <samp><span class="file">C:</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="env">HOME</span></samp> is set neither in the
environment nor in the Registry, Emacs will treat <samp><span class="file">C:\</span></samp> as the
default <code>HOME</code> location, and will not look in the application
data directory, even if it exists.  Note that only <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> is
looked for in <samp><span class="file">C:\</span></samp>; the older name <samp><span class="file">_emacs</span></samp> (see below) is
not.  This use of <samp><span class="file">C:\.emacs</span></samp> to define <code>HOME</code> is
deprecated.

   <p>Whatever the final place is, Emacs sets the internal value of the
<samp><span class="env">HOME</span></samp> environment variable to point to it, and it will use that
location for other files and directories it normally looks for or
creates in your home directory.

   <p>You can always find out what Emacs thinks is your home directory's
location by typing <kbd>C-x d ~/ &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.  This should present the
list of files in the home directory, and show its full name on the
first line.  Likewise, to visit your init file, type <kbd>C-x C-f
~/.emacs &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> (assuming the file's name is <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>).

   <p><a name="index-init-file-_0040file_007b_002eemacs_007d-on-MS_002dWindows-5098"></a>  The home directory is where your init file is stored.  It can have
any name mentioned in <a href="#Init-File">Init File</a>.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007b_005femacs_007d-init-file_002c-MS_002dWindows-5099"></a>  Because MS-DOS does not allow file names with leading dots, and
older Windows systems made it hard to create files with such names,
the Windows port of Emacs supports an init file name <samp><span class="file">_emacs</span></samp>, if
such a file exists in the home directory and <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> does not. 
This name is considered obsolete.

<h3 class="section">G.6 Keyboard Usage on MS-Windows</h3>

<p><a name="index-keyboard_002c-MS_002dWindows-5100"></a>
  This section describes the Windows-specific features related to
keyboard input in Emacs.

   <p><a name="index-MS_002dWindows-keyboard-shortcuts-5101"></a>  Many key combinations (known as &ldquo;keyboard shortcuts&rdquo;) that have
conventional uses in MS-Windows programs conflict with traditional
Emacs key bindings.  (These Emacs key bindings were established years
before Microsoft was founded.)  Examples of conflicts include
<kbd>C-c</kbd>, <kbd>C-x</kbd>, <kbd>C-z</kbd>, <kbd>C-a</kbd>, and <kbd>W-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>. 
You can redefine some of them with meanings more like the MS-Windows
meanings by enabling CUA Mode (see <a href="#CUA-Bindings">CUA Bindings</a>).

   <p><a name="index-w32_002dalt_002dis_002dmeta-5102"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bAlt_007d-key-_0028MS_002dWindows_0029-5103"></a>  By default, the key labeled &lt;Alt&gt; is mapped as the &lt;META&gt;
key.  If you wish it to produce the <code>Alt</code> modifier instead, set
the variable <code>w32-alt-is-meta</code> to a <code>nil</code> value.

   <p><a name="index-w32_002dregister_002dhot_002dkey-5104"></a><a name="index-w32_002dunregister_002dhot_002dkey-5105"></a>  MS-Windows reserves certain key combinations, such as
<kbd>&lt;Alt&gt;-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>, for its own use.  These key combinations are
intercepted by the system before Emacs can see them.  You can use the
<code>w32-register-hot-key</code> function to allow a key sequence to be
seen by Emacs instead of being grabbed by Windows.  This function
registers a key sequence as a <dfn>hot key</dfn>, overriding the special
meaning of that key sequence for Windows.  (MS-Windows is told that
the key sequence is a hot key only when one of the Emacs windows has
focus, so that the special keys still have their usual meaning for
other Windows applications.)

   <p>The argument to <code>w32-register-hot-key</code> must be a single key,
with or without modifiers, in vector form that would be acceptable to
<code>define-key</code>.  The meta modifier is interpreted as the &lt;Alt&gt;
key if <code>w32-alt-is-meta</code> is <code>t</code> (the default), and the hyper
modifier is always interpreted as the Windows key (usually labeled
with &lt;start&gt; and the Windows logo).  If the function succeeds in
registering the key sequence, it returns the hotkey ID, a number;
otherwise it returns <code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-M_002dTAB_0040r_007b_002c-_0028MS_002dWindows_0029_007d-5106"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040kbd_007bM_002d_0040key_007bTAB_007d_007d-vs-_0040kbd_007b_0040key_007bAlt_007d_002d_0040key_007bTAB_007d_007d-_0028MS_002dWindows_0029-5107"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040kbd_007b_0040key_007bAlt_007d_002d_0040key_007bTAB_007d_007d-vs-_0040kbd_007bM_002d_0040key_007bTAB_007d_007d-_0028MS_002dWindows_0029-5108"></a>  For example, <code>(w32-register-hot-key [M-tab])</code> lets you use
<kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> normally in Emacs; for instance, to complete the word or
symbol at point at top level, or to complete the current search string
against previously sought strings during incremental search.

   <p>The function <code>w32-unregister-hot-key</code> reverses the effect of
<code>w32-register-hot-key</code> for its argument key sequence.

   <p><a name="index-w32_002dcapslock_002dis_002dshiftlock-5109"></a>  By default, the &lt;CapsLock&gt; key only affects normal character
keys (it converts lower-case characters to their upper-case
variants).  However, if you set the variable
<code>w32-capslock-is-shiftlock</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> value, the
&lt;CapsLock&gt; key will affect non-character keys as well, as if you
pressed the &lt;Shift&gt; key while typing the non-character key.

   <p><a name="index-w32_002denable_002dcaps_002dlock-5110"></a>  If the variable <code>w32-enable-caps-lock</code> is set to a <code>nil</code>
value, the &lt;CapsLock&gt; key produces the symbol <code>capslock</code>
instead of the shifted version of they keys.  The default value is
<code>t</code>.

   <p><a name="index-w32_002denable_002dnum_002dlock-5111"></a><a name="index-keypad-keys-_0028MS_002dWindows_0029-5112"></a>  Similarly, if <code>w32-enable-num-lock</code> is <code>nil</code>, the
&lt;NumLock&gt; key will produce the symbol <code>kp-numlock</code>.  The
default is <code>t</code>, which causes &lt;NumLock&gt; to work as expected:
toggle the meaning of the keys on the numeric keypad.

   <p><a name="index-w32_002dapps_002dmodifier-5113"></a>  The variable <code>w32-apps-modifier</code> controls the effect of the
&lt;Apps&gt; key (usually located between the right &lt;Alt&gt; and the
right &lt;Ctrl&gt; keys).  Its value can be one of the symbols
<code>hyper</code>, <code>super</code>, <code>meta</code>, <code>alt</code>, <code>control</code>,
or <code>shift</code> for the respective modifier, or <code>nil</code> to appear
as the key <code>apps</code>.  The default is <code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-w32_002dlwindow_002dmodifier-5114"></a><a name="index-w32_002drwindow_002dmodifier-5115"></a><a name="index-w32_002dscroll_002dlock_002dmodifier-5116"></a>  The variable <code>w32-lwindow-modifier</code> determines the effect of
the left Windows key (usually labeled with &lt;start&gt; and the Windows
logo).  If its value is <code>nil</code> (the default), the key will produce
the symbol <code>lwindow</code>.  Setting it to one of the symbols
<code>hyper</code>, <code>super</code>, <code>meta</code>, <code>alt</code>, <code>control</code>,
or <code>shift</code> will produce the respective modifier.  A similar
variable <code>w32-rwindow-modifier</code> controls the effect of the right
Windows key, and <code>w32-scroll-lock-modifier</code> does the same for the
&lt;ScrLock&gt; key.  If these variables are set to <code>nil</code>, the
right Windows key produces the symbol <code>rwindow</code> and &lt;ScrLock&gt;
produces the symbol <code>scroll</code>.

   <p><a name="index-w32_002dpass_002dalt_002dto_002dsystem-5117"></a><a name="index-Windows-system-menu-5118"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bAlt_007d-key-invokes-menu-_0028Windows_0029-5119"></a>  Emacs compiled as a native Windows application normally turns off
the Windows feature that tapping the &lt;Alt&gt; key invokes the Windows
menu.  The reason is that the &lt;Alt&gt; serves as &lt;META&gt; in Emacs. 
When using Emacs, users often press the &lt;META&gt; key temporarily and
then change their minds; if this has the effect of bringing up the
Windows menu, it alters the meaning of subsequent commands.  Many
users find this frustrating.

   <p>You can re-enable Windows's default handling of tapping the &lt;Alt&gt;
key by setting <code>w32-pass-alt-to-system</code> to a non-<code>nil</code>
value.

   <p><a name="index-w32_002dpass_002dlwindow_002dto_002dsystem-5120"></a><a name="index-w32_002dpass_002drwindow_002dto_002dsystem-5121"></a>  The variables <code>w32-pass-lwindow-to-system</code> and
<code>w32-pass-rwindow-to-system</code> determine whether the respective
keys are passed to Windows or swallowed by Emacs.  If the value is
<code>nil</code>, the respective key is silently swallowed by Emacs,
otherwise it is passed to Windows.  The default is <code>t</code> for both
of these variables.  Passing each of these keys to Windows produces
its normal effect: for example, <kbd>&lt;Lwindow&gt;</kbd> opens the
<code>Start</code> menu, etc.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-24" name="fnd-24"><sup>24</sup></a>

   <p><a name="index-w32_002drecognize_002daltgr-5122"></a><a name="index-AltGr-_0040r_007b_0028MS_002dWindows_0029_007d-5123"></a><a name="index-AltGr-key-_0028MS_002dWindows_0029-5124"></a>  The variable <code>w32-recognize-altgr</code> controls whether the
&lt;AltGr&gt; key (if it exists on your keyboard), or its equivalent,
the combination of the right &lt;Alt&gt; and left &lt;Ctrl&gt; keys
pressed together, is recognized as the &lt;AltGr&gt; key.  The default
is <code>t</code>, which means these keys produce <code>AltGr</code>; setting it
to <code>nil</code> causes &lt;AltGr&gt; or the equivalent key combination to
be interpreted as the combination of &lt;Ctrl&gt; and &lt;META&gt;
modifiers.

<p><a name="index-mouse_002c-and-MS_002dWindows-5125"></a>
  This section describes the Windows-specific variables related to
the mouse.

   <p><a name="index-w32_002dmouse_002dbutton_002dtolerance-5126"></a><a name="index-simulation-of-middle-mouse-button-5127"></a>  The variable <code>w32-mouse-button-tolerance</code> specifies the
time interval, in milliseconds, for faking middle mouse button press
on 2-button mice.  If both mouse buttons are depressed within this
time interval, Emacs generates a middle mouse button click event
instead of a double click on one of the buttons.

   <p><a name="index-w32_002dpass_002dextra_002dmouse_002dbuttons_002dto_002dsystem-5128"></a>  If the variable <code>w32-pass-extra-mouse-buttons-to-system</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>, Emacs passes the fourth and fifth mouse buttons to
Windows.

   <p><a name="index-w32_002dswap_002dmouse_002dbuttons-5129"></a>  The variable <code>w32-swap-mouse-buttons</code> controls which of the 3
mouse buttons generates the <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> events.  When it is
<code>nil</code> (the default), the middle button generates <kbd>mouse-2</kbd>
and the right button generates <kbd>mouse-3</kbd> events.  If this variable
is non-<code>nil</code>, the roles of these two buttons are reversed.

<h3 class="section">G.8 Subprocesses on Windows 9X/ME and Windows NT/2K/XP/Vista/7/8/10</h3>

<p><a name="index-subprocesses-on-MS_002dWindows-5130"></a>
<a name="index-DOS-applications_002c-running-from-Emacs-5131"></a>  Emacs compiled as a native Windows application (as opposed to the DOS
version) includes full support for asynchronous subprocesses. 
In the Windows version, synchronous and asynchronous subprocesses work
fine on both
Windows 9X/ME and Windows NT/2K/XP/Vista/7/8/10 as long as you run
only 32-bit or 64-bit Windows
applications.  However, when you run a DOS application in a subprocess,
you may encounter problems or be unable to run the application at all;
and if you run two DOS applications at the same time in two
subprocesses, you may have to reboot your system.

   <p>Since the standard command interpreter (and most command line utilities)
on Windows 9X are DOS applications, these problems are significant when
using that system.  But there's nothing we can do about them; only
Microsoft can fix them.

   <p>If you run just one DOS application subprocess, the subprocess should
work as expected as long as it is &ldquo;well-behaved&rdquo; and does not perform
direct screen access or other unusual actions.  If you have a CPU
monitor application, your machine will appear to be 100% busy even when
the DOS application is idle, but this is only an artifact of the way CPU
monitors measure processor load.

   <p>You must terminate the DOS application before you start any other DOS
application in a different subprocess.  Emacs is unable to interrupt or
terminate a DOS subprocess.  The only way you can terminate such a
subprocess is by giving it a command that tells its program to exit.

   <p>If you attempt to run two DOS applications at the same time in separate
subprocesses, the second one that is started will be suspended until the
first one finishes, even if either or both of them are asynchronous.

   <p><a name="index-kill-DOS-application-5132"></a>If you can go to the first subprocess, and tell it to exit, the second
subprocess should continue normally.  However, if the second subprocess
is synchronous, Emacs itself will be hung until the first subprocess
finishes.  If it will not finish without user input, then you have no
choice but to reboot if you are running on Windows 9X.  If you are
running on Windows NT/2K/XP, you can use a process viewer application to kill
the appropriate instance of NTVDM instead (this will terminate both DOS
subprocesses).

   <p>If you have to reboot Windows 9X in this situation, do not use the
<code>Shutdown</code> command on the <code>Start</code> menu; that usually hangs the
system.  Instead, type <kbd>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-&lt;Alt&gt;-&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd> and then choose
<code>Shutdown</code>.  That usually works, although it may take a few minutes
to do its job.

   <p><a name="index-w32_002dquote_002dprocess_002dargs-5133"></a>  The variable <code>w32-quote-process-args</code> controls how Emacs quotes
the process arguments.  Non-<code>nil</code> means quote with the <code>"</code>
character.  If the value is a character, Emacs uses that character to escape
any quote characters that appear; otherwise it chooses a suitable escape
character based on the type of the program.

   <p><a name="index-w32_002dpipe_002dbuffer_002dsize-5134"></a>  The variable <code>w32-pipe-buffer-size</code> controls the size of the
buffer Emacs requests from the system when it creates pipes for
communications with subprocesses.  The default value is zero, which
lets the OS choose the size.  Any valid positive value will request a
buffer of that size in bytes.  This can be used to tailor
communications with subprocesses to programs that exhibit unusual
behavior with respect to buffering pipe I/O.

   <p><a name="index-w32_002dshell_002dexecute-5135"></a>  The function <code>w32-shell-execute</code> can be useful for writing
customized commands that run MS-Windows applications registered to
handle a certain standard Windows operation for a specific type of
document or file.  This function is a wrapper around the Windows
<code>ShellExecute</code> API.  See the MS-Windows API documentation for
more details.

<h3 class="section">G.9 Printing and MS-Windows</h3>

<p>Printing commands, such as <code>lpr-buffer</code> (see <a href="#Printing">Printing</a>) and
<code>ps-print-buffer</code> (see <a href="#PostScript">PostScript</a>) work in MS-DOS and
MS-Windows by sending the output to one of the printer ports, if a
Posix-style <code>lpr</code> program is unavailable.  The same Emacs
variables control printing on all systems, but in some cases they have
different default values on MS-DOS and MS-Windows.

   <p>Emacs on MS Windows attempts to determine your default printer
automatically (using the function <code>default-printer-name</code>). 
But in some rare cases this can fail, or you may wish to use a different
printer from within Emacs.  The rest of this section explains how to
tell Emacs which printer to use.

   <p><a name="index-printer_002dname_0040r_007b_002c-_0028MS_002dDOS_002fMS_002dWindows_0029_007d-5136"></a>  If you want to use your local printer, then set the Lisp variable
<code>lpr-command</code> to <code>""</code> (its default value on Windows) and
<code>printer-name</code> to the name of the printer port&mdash;for example,
<code>"PRN"</code>, the usual local printer port, or <code>"LPT2"</code>, or
<code>"COM1"</code> for a serial printer.  You can also set
<code>printer-name</code> to a file name, in which case &ldquo;printed&rdquo; output
is actually appended to that file.  If you set <code>printer-name</code> to
<code>"NUL"</code>, printed output is silently discarded (sent to the system
null device).

   <p>You can also use a printer shared by another machine by setting
<code>printer-name</code> to the UNC share name for that printer&mdash;for
example, <code>"//joes_pc/hp4si"</code>.  (It doesn't matter whether you use
forward slashes or backslashes here.)  To find out the names of shared
printers, run the command `<samp><span class="samp">net view</span></samp>' from the command prompt to
obtain a list of servers, and `<samp><span class="samp">net view </span><var>server-name</var></samp>' to see
the names of printers (and directories) shared by that server. 
Alternatively, click the `<samp><span class="samp">Network Neighborhood</span></samp>' icon on your
desktop, and look for machines that share their printers via the
network.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bnet-use_007d_002c-and-printing-on-MS_002dWindows-5137"></a><a name="index-networked-printers-_0028MS_002dWindows_0029-5138"></a>  If the printer doesn't appear in the output of `<samp><span class="samp">net view</span></samp>', or
if setting <code>printer-name</code> to the UNC share name doesn't produce a
hardcopy on that printer, you can use the `<samp><span class="samp">net use</span></samp>' command to
connect a local print port such as <code>"LPT2"</code> to the networked
printer.  For example, typing <kbd>net use LPT2: \\joes_pc\hp4si</kbd><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-25" name="fnd-25"><sup>25</sup></a>
causes Windows to <dfn>capture</dfn> the <code>LPT2</code> port and redirect the
printed material to the printer connected to the machine <code>joes_pc</code>. 
After this command, setting <code>printer-name</code> to <code>"LPT2"</code>
should produce the hardcopy on the networked printer.

   <p>With some varieties of Windows network software, you can instruct
Windows to capture a specific printer port such as <code>"LPT2"</code>, and
redirect it to a networked printer via the <code>Control&nbsp;Panel-&gt;Printers</code><!-- /@w --> applet instead of `<samp><span class="samp">net use</span></samp>'.

   <p>If you set <code>printer-name</code> to a file name, it's best to use an
absolute file name.  Emacs changes the working directory according to
the default directory of the current buffer, so if the file name in
<code>printer-name</code> is relative, you will end up with several such
files, each one in the directory of the buffer from which the printing
was done.

   <p>If the value of <code>printer-name</code> is correct, but printing does
not produce the hardcopy on your printer, it is possible that your
printer does not support printing plain text (some cheap printers omit
this functionality).  In that case, try the PostScript print commands,
described below.

   <p><a name="index-print_002dbuffer-_0040r_007b_0028MS_002dDOS_0029_007d-5139"></a><a name="index-print_002dregion-_0040r_007b_0028MS_002dDOS_0029_007d-5140"></a><a name="index-lpr_002dheaders_002dswitches-_0040r_007b_0028MS_002dDOS_0029_007d-5141"></a>  The commands <code>print-buffer</code> and <code>print-region</code> call the
<code>pr</code> program, or use special switches to the <code>lpr</code> program, to
produce headers on each printed page.  MS-DOS and MS-Windows don't
normally have these programs, so by default, the variable
<code>lpr-headers-switches</code> is set so that the requests to print page
headers are silently ignored.  Thus, <code>print-buffer</code> and
<code>print-region</code> produce the same output as <code>lpr-buffer</code> and
<code>lpr-region</code>, respectively.  If you do have a suitable <code>pr</code>
program (for example, from GNU Coreutils), set
<code>lpr-headers-switches</code> to <code>nil</code>; Emacs will then call
<code>pr</code> to produce the page headers, and print the resulting output as
specified by <code>printer-name</code>.

   <p><a name="index-print_002dregion_002dfunction-_0040r_007b_0028MS_002dDOS_0029_007d-5142"></a><a name="index-lpr-usage-under-MS_002dDOS-5143"></a><a name="index-lpr_002dcommand-_0040r_007b_0028MS_002dDOS_0029_007d-5144"></a><a name="index-lpr_002dswitches-_0040r_007b_0028MS_002dDOS_0029_007d-5145"></a>  Finally, if you do have an <code>lpr</code> work-alike, you can set the
variable <code>lpr-command</code> to <code>"lpr"</code>.  Then Emacs will use
<code>lpr</code> for printing, as on other systems.  (If the name of the
program isn't <code>lpr</code>, set <code>lpr-command</code> to the appropriate value.) 
The variable <code>lpr-switches</code> has its standard meaning
when <code>lpr-command</code> is not <code>""</code>.  If the variable
<code>printer-name</code> has a string value, it is used as the value for the
<code>-P</code> option to <code>lpr</code>, as on Unix.

   <p><a name="index-ps_002dprint_002dbuffer-_0040r_007b_0028MS_002dDOS_0029_007d-5146"></a><a name="index-ps_002dspool_002dbuffer-_0040r_007b_0028MS_002dDOS_0029_007d-5147"></a><a name="index-ps_002dprinter_002dname-_0040r_007b_0028MS_002dDOS_0029_007d-5148"></a><a name="index-ps_002dlpr_002dcommand-_0040r_007b_0028MS_002dDOS_0029_007d-5149"></a><a name="index-ps_002dlpr_002dswitches-_0040r_007b_0028MS_002dDOS_0029_007d-5150"></a>  A parallel set of variables, <code>ps-lpr-command</code>,
<code>ps-lpr-switches</code>, and <code>ps-printer-name</code> (see <a href="#PostScript-Variables">PostScript Variables</a>), defines how PostScript files should be printed.  These
variables are used in the same way as the corresponding variables
described above for non-PostScript printing.  Thus, the value of
<code>ps-printer-name</code> is used as the name of the device (or file) to
which PostScript output is sent, just as <code>printer-name</code> is used
for non-PostScript printing.  (There are two distinct sets of
variables in case you have two printers attached to two different
ports, and only one of them is a PostScript printer.)

   <p><a name="index-Ghostscript_002c-use-for-PostScript-printing-5151"></a>  The default value of the variable <code>ps-lpr-command</code> is <code>""</code>,
which causes PostScript output to be sent to the printer port specified
by <code>ps-printer-name</code>; but <code>ps-lpr-command</code> can also be set to
the name of a program which will accept PostScript files.  Thus, if you
have a non-PostScript printer, you can set this variable to the name of
a PostScript interpreter program (such as Ghostscript).  Any switches
that need to be passed to the interpreter program are specified using
<code>ps-lpr-switches</code>.  (If the value of <code>ps-printer-name</code> is a
string, it will be added to the list of switches as the value for the
<code>-P</code> option.  This is probably only useful if you are using
<code>lpr</code>, so when using an interpreter typically you would set
<code>ps-printer-name</code> to something other than a string so it is
ignored.)

   <p>For example, to use Ghostscript for printing on the system's default
printer, put this in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file:

<pre class="example">     (setq ps-printer-name t)
     (setq ps-lpr-command "D:/gs6.01/bin/gswin32c.exe")
     (setq ps-lpr-switches '("-q" "-dNOPAUSE" "-dBATCH"
                             "-sDEVICE=mswinpr2"
                             "-sPAPERSIZE=a4"))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(This assumes that Ghostscript is installed in the
<samp><span class="file">D:/gs6.01</span></samp> directory.)

<h3 class="section">G.10 Specifying Fonts on MS-Windows</h3>

<p><a name="index-font-specification-_0028MS-Windows_0029-5152"></a>
  Starting with Emacs 23, fonts are specified by their name, size
and optional properties.  The format for specifying fonts comes from the
fontconfig library used in modern Free desktops:

<pre class="example">       [Family[-PointSize]][:Option1=Value1[:Option2=Value2[...]]]
</pre>
   <p>The old XLFD based format is also supported for backwards compatibility.

   <p><a name="index-font-backend-selection-_0028MS_002dWindows_0029-5153"></a>  Emacs 23 and later supports a number of font backends.  Currently,
the <code>gdi</code> and <code>uniscribe</code> backends are supported on Windows. 
The <code>gdi</code> font backend is available on all versions of Windows,
and supports all fonts that are natively supported by Windows.  The
<code>uniscribe</code> font backend is available on Windows 2000 and later,
and supports TrueType and OpenType fonts.  Some languages requiring
complex layout can only be properly supported by the Uniscribe
backend.  By default, both backends are enabled if supported, with
<code>uniscribe</code> taking priority over <code>gdi</code>.  To override that
and use the GDI backend even if Uniscribe is available, invoke Emacs
with the <kbd>-xrm Emacs.fontBackend:gdi</kbd> command-line argument, or
add a <code>Emacs.fontBackend</code> resource with the value <code>gdi</code> in
the Registry under either the
`<samp><span class="samp">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\GNU\Emacs</span></samp>' or the
`<samp><span class="samp">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\GNU\Emacs</span></samp>' key (see <a href="#Resources">Resources</a>).

   <p><a name="index-font-properties-_0028MS-Windows_0029-5154"></a>Optional properties common to all font backends on MS-Windows are:

     
<a name="index-font_002dweight_002dtable-_0040r_007b_0028MS_002dWindows_0029_007d-5155"></a>
<dl><dt><code>weight</code><dd>Specifies the weight of the font.  Special values <code>light</code>,
<code>medium</code>, <code>demibold</code>, <code>bold</code>, and <code>black</code> can be specified
without <code>weight=</code> (e.g., <kbd>Courier New-12:bold</kbd>).  Otherwise,
the weight should be a numeric value between 100 and 900, or one of the
named weights in <code>font-weight-table</code>.  If unspecified, a regular font
is assumed.

     <p><a name="index-font_002dslant_002dtable-_0040r_007b_0028MS_002dWindows_0029_007d-5156"></a><br><dt><code>slant</code><dd>Specifies whether the font is italic.  Special values
<code>roman</code>, <code>italic</code> and <code>oblique</code> can be specified
without <code>slant=</code> (e.g., <kbd>Courier New-12:italic</kbd>). 
Otherwise, the slant should be a numeric value, or one of the named
slants in <code>font-slant-table</code>.  On Windows, any slant above 150 is
treated as italics, and anything below as roman.

     <br><dt><code>family</code><dd>Specifies the font family, but normally this will be specified
at the start of the font name.

of the point size specified after the family name.

     <br><dt><code>adstyle</code><dd>Specifies additional style information for the font. 
On MS-Windows, the values <code>mono</code>, <code>sans</code>, <code>serif</code>,
<code>script</code> and <code>decorative</code> are recognized.  These are most useful
as a fallback with the font family left unspecified.

     <p><a name="index-w32_002dcharset_002dinfo_002dalist-5157"></a><br><dt><code>registry</code><dd>Specifies the character set registry that the font is

selection of fonts to those that support a particular character set by
using a specific registry from <code>w32-charset-info-alist</code> here.

     <br><dt><code>spacing</code><dd>Specifies how the font is spaced.  The <code>p</code> spacing specifies
a proportional font, and <code>m</code> or <code>c</code> specify a monospaced font.

     <br><dt><code>foundry</code><dd>Not used on Windows, but for informational purposes and to
prevent problems with code that expects it to be set, is set internally to
<code>raster</code> for bitmapped fonts, <code>outline</code> for scalable fonts,

determines whether to make the system caret visible.  The default when
no screen reader software is in use is <code>nil</code>, which means Emacs
draws its own cursor to indicate the position of point.  A
non-<code>nil</code> value means Emacs will indicate point location with the
system caret; this facilitates use of screen reader software, and is
the default when such software is detected when running Emacs. 
When this variable is non-<code>nil</code>, other variables affecting the
cursor display have no effect.

application; all of this chapter applies for all of those systems, if
you use an Emacs that was built for MS-DOS.

<p><a name="index-DEL-_0040r_007b_0028MS_002dDOS_0029_007d-5167"></a><a name="index-BS-_0040r_007b_0028MS_002dDOS_0029_007d-5168"></a>  The key that is called &lt;DEL&gt; in Emacs (because that's how it is
designated on most workstations) is known as &lt;BS&gt; (backspace) on a
PC.  That is why the PC-specific terminal initialization remaps the
&lt;BS&gt; key to act as &lt;DEL&gt;; the &lt;Delete&gt; key is remapped to act
as <kbd>C-d</kbd> for the same reasons.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dg-_0040r_007b_0028MS_002dDOS_0029_007d-5169"></a><a name="index-C_002dBreak-_0040r_007b_0028MS_002dDOS_0029_007d-5170"></a><a name="index-quitting-on-MS_002dDOS-5171"></a>  Emacs built for MS-DOS recognizes <kbd>C-&lt;Break&gt;</kbd> as a quit
character, just like <kbd>C-g</kbd>.  This is because Emacs cannot detect
that you have typed <kbd>C-g</kbd> until it is ready for more input.  As a
consequence, you cannot use <kbd>C-g</kbd> to stop a running command
(see <a href="#Quitting">Quitting</a>). 
By contrast, <kbd>C-&lt;Break&gt;</kbd> <em>is</em> detected as soon as you
type it (as <kbd>C-g</kbd> is on other systems), so it can be used to stop
a running command and for emergency escape
(see <a href="#Emergency-Escape">Emergency Escape</a>).

   <p><a name="index-Meta-_0028under-MS_002dDOS_0029-5172"></a><a name="index-Hyper-_0028under-MS_002dDOS_0029-5173"></a><a name="index-Super-_0028under-MS_002dDOS_0029-5174"></a><a name="index-dos_002dsuper_002dkey-5175"></a><a name="index-dos_002dhyper_002dkey-5176"></a>  The PC keyboard maps use the left &lt;Alt&gt; key as the &lt;META&gt; key. 
You have two choices for emulating the &lt;SUPER&gt; and &lt;HYPER&gt; keys:
choose either the right &lt;Ctrl&gt; key or the right &lt;Alt&gt; key by
setting the variables <code>dos-hyper-key</code> and <code>dos-super-key</code> to 1
or 2 respectively.  If neither <code>dos-super-key</code> nor
<code>dos-hyper-key</code> is 1, then by default the right &lt;Alt&gt; key is
also mapped to the &lt;META&gt; key.  However, if the MS-DOS international
keyboard support program <samp><span class="file">KEYB.COM</span></samp> is installed, Emacs will
<em>not</em> map the right &lt;Alt&gt; to &lt;META&gt;, since it is used for
accessing characters like <kbd>~</kbd> and <kbd>@</kbd> on non-US keyboard
layouts; in this case, you may only use the left &lt;Alt&gt; as &lt;META&gt;
key.

what key codes are returned by keys in the numeric keypad.  You can also
define the keypad &lt;ENTER&gt; key to act like <kbd>C-j</kbd>, by putting the
following line into your <samp><span class="file">_emacs</span></samp> file:

<pre class="smallexample">     ;; <span class="roman">Make the &lt;ENTER&gt; key from the numeric keypad act as </span><kbd>C-j</kbd><span class="roman">.</span>

<h4 class="subsection">G.12.2 Mouse Usage on MS-DOS</h4>

<p><a name="index-mouse-support-under-MS_002dDOS-5179"></a>  Emacs on MS-DOS supports a mouse (on the default terminal only). 
The mouse commands work as documented, including those that use menus
and the menu bar
(see <a href="#Menu-Bar">Menu Bar</a>). 
 Scroll bars don't work in MS-DOS Emacs.  PC mice usually have only
two buttons; these act as <kbd>mouse-1</kbd> and <kbd>mouse-2</kbd>, but if you
press both of them together, that has the effect of <kbd>mouse-3</kbd>.  If
the mouse does have 3 buttons, Emacs detects that at startup, and all
the 3 buttons function normally, as on X.

   <p>Help strings for menu-bar and pop-up menus are displayed in the echo
area when the mouse pointer moves across the menu items.  Highlighting
of mouse-sensitive text
(see <a href="#Mouse-References">Mouse References</a>)
is also supported.

   <p><a name="index-mouse_002c-set-number-of-buttons-5180"></a><a name="index-msdos_002dset_002dmouse_002dbuttons-5181"></a>  Some versions of mouse drivers don't report the number of mouse
buttons correctly.  For example, mice with a wheel report that they
have 3 buttons, but only 2 of them are passed to Emacs; the clicks on
the wheel, which serves as the middle button, are not passed.  In
these cases, you can use the <kbd>M-x msdos-set-mouse-buttons</kbd> command
to tell Emacs how many mouse buttons to expect.  You could make such a
setting permanent by adding this fragment to your <samp><span class="file">_emacs</span></samp> init
file:

<pre class="example">     ;; <span class="roman">Treat the mouse like a 2-button mouse.</span>
     (msdos-set-mouse-buttons 2)
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-Windows-clipboard-support-5182"></a>  Emacs built for MS-DOS supports clipboard operations when it runs on
Windows.  Commands that put text on the kill ring, or yank text from
the ring, check the Windows clipboard first, just as Emacs does on the
X Window System
(see <a href="#Mouse-Commands">Mouse Commands</a>). 
Only the primary selection and the cut buffer are supported by MS-DOS
Emacs on Windows; the secondary selection always appears as empty.

   <p>Due to the way clipboard access is implemented by Windows, the
length of text you can put into the clipboard is limited by the amount
of free DOS memory that is available to Emacs.  Usually, up to 620KB of
text can be put into the clipboard, but this limit depends on the system
configuration and is lower if you run Emacs as a subprocess of
another program.  If the killed text does not fit, Emacs outputs a
message saying so, and does not put the text into the clipboard.

   <p>Null characters also cannot be put into the Windows clipboard.  If the
killed text includes null characters, Emacs does not put such text into
the clipboard, and displays in the echo area a message to that effect.

   <p><a name="index-dos_002ddisplay_002dscancodes-5183"></a>  The variable <code>dos-display-scancodes</code>, when non-<code>nil</code>,
directs Emacs to display the <acronym>ASCII</acronym> value and the keyboard scan code of
each keystroke; this feature serves as a complement to the
<code>view-lossage</code> command, for debugging.

<h4 class="subsection">G.12.3 Display on MS-DOS</h4>

<p><a name="index-faces-under-MS_002dDOS-5184"></a><a name="index-fonts_002c-emulating-under-MS_002dDOS-5185"></a>
  Display on MS-DOS cannot use font variants, like bold or italic, but
it does support multiple faces, each of which can specify a foreground
and a background color.  Therefore, you can get the full functionality
of Emacs packages that use fonts (such as <code>font-lock</code>, Enriched
Text mode, and others) by defining the relevant faces to use different
colors.  Use the <code>list-colors-display</code> command
(see <a href="#Colors">Colors</a>)
and the <code>list-faces-display</code> command
(see <a href="#Faces">Faces</a>)
to see what colors and faces are available and what they look like.

   <p>See <a href="#MS_002dDOS-and-MULE">MS-DOS and MULE</a>, later in this chapter, for information on
how Emacs displays glyphs and characters that aren't supported by the
native font built into the DOS display.

   <p><a name="index-cursor-shape-on-MS_002dDOS-5186"></a>  When Emacs starts, it changes the cursor shape to a solid box.  This
is for compatibility with other systems, where the box cursor is the
default in Emacs.  This default shape can be changed to a bar by
specifying the <code>cursor-type</code> parameter in the variable
<code>default-frame-alist</code>
(see <a href="#Creating-Frames">Creating Frames</a>). 
The MS-DOS terminal doesn't support a vertical-bar cursor,
so the bar cursor is horizontal, and the <var>width</var> parameter,
if specified by the frame parameters, actually determines its height. 
For this reason, the <code>bar</code> and <code>hbar</code> cursor types produce
the same effect on MS-DOS.  As an extension, the bar cursor
specification can include the starting scan line of the cursor as well
as its width, like this:

<pre class="example">      '(cursor-type bar <var>width</var> . <var>start</var>)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In addition, if the <var>width</var> parameter is negative, the cursor bar
begins at the top of the character cell.

   <p><a name="index-frames-on-MS_002dDOS-5187"></a>  The MS-DOS terminal can only display a single frame at a time.  The
Emacs frame facilities work on MS-DOS much as they do on text
terminals
(see <a href="#Frames">Frames</a>). 
When you run Emacs from a DOS window on MS-Windows, you can make the
visible frame smaller than the full screen, but Emacs still cannot
display more than a single frame at a time.

   <p><a name="index-frame-size-under-MS_002dDOS-5188"></a><a name="index-dos_002dmode4350-5189"></a><a name="index-dos_002dmode25-5190"></a>  The <code>dos-mode4350</code> command switches the display to 43 or 50
lines, depending on your hardware; the <code>dos-mode25</code> command switches
to the default 80x25 screen size.

   <p>By default, Emacs only knows how to set screen sizes of 80 columns by
25, 28, 35, 40, 43 or 50 rows.  However, if your video adapter has
special video modes that will switch the display to other sizes, you can
have Emacs support those too.  When you ask Emacs to switch the frame to
<var>n</var> rows by <var>m</var> columns dimensions, it checks if there is a
variable called <code>screen-dimensions-</code><var>n</var><code>x</code><var>m</var>, and if so,
uses its value (which must be an integer) as the video mode to switch
to.  (Emacs switches to that video mode by calling the BIOS <code>Set
Video Mode</code> function with the value of
<code>screen-dimensions-</code><var>n</var><code>x</code><var>m</var> in the <code>AL</code> register.) 
For example, suppose your adapter will switch to 66x80 dimensions when
put into video mode 85.  Then you can make Emacs support this screen
size by putting the following into your <samp><span class="file">_emacs</span></samp> file:

<pre class="example">     (setq screen-dimensions-66x80 85)
</pre>
   <p>Since Emacs on MS-DOS can only set the frame size to specific
supported dimensions, it cannot honor every possible frame resizing
request.  When an unsupported size is requested, Emacs chooses the next
larger supported size beyond the specified size.  For example, if you
ask for 36x80 frame, you will get 40x80 instead.

   <p>The variables <code>screen-dimensions-</code><var>n</var><code>x</code><var>m</var> are used only
when they exactly match the specified size; the search for the next
larger supported size ignores them.  In the above example, even if your
VGA supports 38x80 dimensions and you define a variable
<code>screen-dimensions-38x80</code> with a suitable value, you will still get
40x80 screen when you ask for a 36x80 frame.  If you want to get the
38x80 size in this case, you can do it by setting the variable named
<code>screen-dimensions-36x80</code> with the same video mode value as
<code>screen-dimensions-38x80</code>.

   <p>Changing frame dimensions on MS-DOS has the effect of changing all the
other frames to the new dimensions.

<h4 class="subsection">G.12.4 File Names on MS-DOS</h4>

<p><a name="index-file-names-under-MS_002dDOS-5191"></a><a name="index-init-file_002c-default-name-under-MS_002dDOS-5192"></a>
  On MS-DOS, file names are case-insensitive and limited to eight
characters, plus optionally a period and three more characters.  Emacs
knows enough about these limitations to handle file names that were
meant for other operating systems.  For instance, leading dots
`<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>'  in file names are invalid in MS-DOS, so Emacs transparently
converts them to underscores `<samp><span class="samp">_</span></samp>'; thus your default init file
(see <a href="#Init-File">Init File</a>)
is called <samp><span class="file">_emacs</span></samp> on MS-DOS.  Excess characters before or after
the period are generally ignored by MS-DOS itself; thus, if you visit
the file <samp><span class="file">LongFileName.EvenLongerExtension</span></samp>, you will silently
get <samp><span class="file">longfile.eve</span></samp>, but Emacs will still display the long file
name on the mode line.  Other than that, it's up to you to specify
file names which are valid under MS-DOS; the transparent conversion as
described above only works on file names built into Emacs.

   <p><a name="index-backup-file-names-on-MS_002dDOS-5193"></a>  The above restrictions on the file names on MS-DOS make it almost
impossible to construct the name of a backup file
(see <a href="#Backup-Names">Backup Names</a>)
without losing some of the original file name characters.  For
example, the name of a backup file for <samp><span class="file">docs.txt</span></samp> is
<samp><span class="file">docs.tx~</span></samp> even if single backup is used.

   <p><a name="index-file-names-under-Windows-95_002fNT-5194"></a><a name="index-long-file-names-in-DOS-box-under-Windows-95_002fNT-5195"></a>  If you run Emacs as a DOS application under Windows 9X, Windows ME, or
Windows 2000/XP, you can turn on support for long file names.  If you do
that, Emacs doesn't truncate file names or convert them to lower case;
instead, it uses the file names that you specify, verbatim.  To enable
long file name support, set the environment variable <samp><span class="env">LFN</span></samp> to
`<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>' before starting Emacs.  Unfortunately, Windows NT doesn't allow
DOS programs to access long file names, so Emacs built for MS-DOS will
only see their short 8+3 aliases.

   <p><a name="index-HOME-directory-under-MS_002dDOS-5196"></a>  MS-DOS has no notion of home directory, so Emacs on MS-DOS pretends
that the directory where it is installed is the value of the <samp><span class="env">HOME</span></samp>
environment variable.  That is, if your Emacs binary,
<samp><span class="file">emacs.exe</span></samp>, is in the directory <samp><span class="file">c:/utils/emacs/bin</span></samp>, then
Emacs acts as if <samp><span class="env">HOME</span></samp> were set to `<samp><span class="samp">c:/utils/emacs</span></samp>'.  In
particular, that is where Emacs looks for the init file <samp><span class="file">_emacs</span></samp>. 
With this in mind, you can use `<samp><span class="samp">~</span></samp>' in file names as an alias for
the home directory, as you would on GNU or Unix.  You can also set
<samp><span class="env">HOME</span></samp> variable in the environment before starting Emacs; its
value will then override the above default behavior.

   <p>Emacs on MS-DOS handles the directory name <samp><span class="file">/dev</span></samp> specially,
because of a feature in the emulator libraries of DJGPP that pretends
I/O devices have names in that directory.  We recommend that you avoid
using an actual directory named <samp><span class="file">/dev</span></samp> on any disk.

can work on MS-DOS by sending the output to one of the printer ports,
if a Posix-style <code>lpr</code> program is unavailable.  The same Emacs
variables control printing on all systems, but in some cases they have
different default values on MS-DOS.

   <p>See <a href="#Windows-Printing">Windows Printing</a>,
for details about setting up printing to a networked printer.

   <p>Some printers expect DOS codepage encoding of non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> text, even
though they are connected to a Windows machine that uses a different
encoding for the same locale.  For example, in the Latin-1 locale, DOS
uses codepage 850 whereas Windows uses codepage 1252.  See <a href="#MS_002dDOS-and-MULE">MS-DOS and MULE</a>.  When you print to such printers from Windows, you can use the
<kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt; c</kbd> (<code>universal-coding-system-argument</code>) command
before <kbd>M-x lpr-buffer</kbd>; Emacs will then convert the text to the DOS
codepage that you specify.  For example,
<kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt; c cp850-dos &lt;RET&gt; M-x lpr-region &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
will print the region while converting it to the codepage 850 encoding.

   <p><a name="index-dos_002dprinter-5197"></a><a name="index-dos_002dps_002dprinter-5198"></a>  For backwards compatibility, the value of <code>dos-printer</code>
(<code>dos-ps-printer</code>), if it has a value, overrides the value of
<code>printer-name</code> (<code>ps-printer-name</code>), on MS-DOS.

<h4 class="subsection">G.12.6 International Support on MS-DOS</h4>

<p><a name="index-international-support-_0040r_007b_0028MS_002dDOS_0029_007d-5199"></a>
  Emacs on MS-DOS supports the same international character sets as it
does on GNU, Unix and other platforms
(see <a href="#International">International</a>),
including coding systems for converting between the different
character sets.  However, due to incompatibilities between
MS-DOS/MS-Windows and other systems, there are several DOS-specific
aspects of this support that you should be aware of.  This section
describes these aspects.

   <p>The description below is largely specific to the MS-DOS port of
Emacs, especially where it talks about practical implications for
Emacs users.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-x dos-codepage-setup</kbd><dd>Set up Emacs display and coding systems as appropriate for the current
DOS codepage. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-codepage_002c-MS_002dDOS-5200"></a><a name="index-DOS-codepages-5201"></a>  MS-DOS is designed to support one character set of 256 characters at
any given time, but gives you a variety of character sets to choose
from.  The alternative character sets are known as <dfn>DOS codepages</dfn>. 
Each codepage includes all 128 <acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters, but the other 128
characters (codes 128 through 255) vary from one codepage to another. 
Each DOS codepage is identified by a 3-digit number, such as 850, 862,
etc.

   <p>In contrast to X, which lets you use several fonts at the same time,
MS-DOS normally doesn't allow use of several codepages in a single
session.  MS-DOS was designed to load a single codepage at system
startup, and require you to reboot in order to change
it<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-26" name="fnd-26"><sup>26</sup></a>.  Much the same limitation applies when you run DOS
executables on other systems such as MS-Windows.

   <p><a name="index-dos_002dcodepage-5202"></a>  For multibyte operation on MS-DOS, Emacs needs to know which
characters the chosen DOS codepage can display.  So it queries the
system shortly after startup to get the chosen codepage number, and
stores the number in the variable <code>dos-codepage</code>.  Some systems
return the default value 437 for the current codepage, even though the
actual codepage is different.  (This typically happens when you use the
codepage built into the display hardware.)  You can specify a different
codepage for Emacs to use by setting the variable <code>dos-codepage</code> in
your init file.

   <p><a name="index-language-environment_002c-automatic-selection-on-_0040r_007bMS_002dDOS_007d-5203"></a>  Multibyte Emacs supports only certain DOS codepages: those which can
display Far-Eastern scripts, like the Japanese codepage 932, and those
that encode a single ISO 8859 character set.

   <p>The Far-Eastern codepages can directly display one of the MULE
character sets for these countries, so Emacs simply sets up to use the
appropriate terminal coding system that is supported by the codepage. 
The special features described in the rest of this section mostly
pertain to codepages that encode ISO 8859 character sets.

   <p>For the codepages that correspond to one of the ISO character sets,
Emacs knows the character set based on the codepage number.  Emacs
automatically creates a coding system to support reading and writing
files that use the current codepage, and uses this coding system by
default.  The name of this coding system is <code>cp</code><var>nnn</var>, where
<var>nnn</var> is the codepage number.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-27" name="fnd-27"><sup>27</sup></a>

   <p><a name="index-mode-line-_0040r_007b_0028MS_002dDOS_0029_007d-5204"></a>  All the <code>cp</code><var>nnn</var> coding systems use the letter `<samp><span class="samp">D</span></samp>'
(for &ldquo;DOS&rdquo;) as their mode-line mnemonic.  Since both the terminal
coding system and the default coding system for file I/O are set to
the proper <code>cp</code><var>nnn</var> coding system at startup, it is normal
for the mode line on MS-DOS to begin with `<samp><span class="samp">-DD\-</span></samp>'. 
See <a href="#Mode-Line">Mode Line</a>. 
Far-Eastern DOS terminals do not use the <code>cp</code><var>nnn</var> coding
systems, and thus their initial mode line looks like the Emacs
default.

   <p>Since the codepage number also indicates which script you are using,
Emacs automatically runs <code>set-language-environment</code> to select the
language environment for that script
(see <a href="#Language-Environments">Language Environments</a>).

   <p>If a buffer contains a character belonging to some other ISO 8859
character set, not the one that the chosen DOS codepage supports, Emacs
displays it using a sequence of <acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters.  For example, if the
current codepage doesn't have a glyph for the letter `<samp><span class="samp">&ograve;</span></samp>' (small
`<samp><span class="samp">o</span></samp>' with a grave accent), it is displayed as `<samp><span class="samp">{`o}</span></samp>', where
the braces serve as a visual indication that this is a single character. 
(This may look awkward for some non-Latin characters, such as those from
Greek or Hebrew alphabets, but it is still readable by a person who
knows the language.)  Even though the character may occupy several
columns on the screen, it is really still just a single character, and
all Emacs commands treat it as one.

   <p><a name="index-MS_002dWindows-codepages-5205"></a>  MS-Windows provides its own codepages, which are different from the
DOS codepages for the same locale.  For example, DOS codepage 850
supports the same character set as Windows codepage 1252; DOS codepage
855 supports the same character set as Windows codepage 1251, etc. 
The MS-Windows version of Emacs uses the current codepage for display
when invoked with the `<samp><span class="samp">-nw</span></samp>' option.

<h4 class="subsection">G.12.7 Subprocesses on MS-DOS</h4>

<p><a name="index-compilation-under-MS_002dDOS-5206"></a><a name="index-inferior-processes-under-MS_002dDOS-5207"></a><a name="index-compile-_0040r_007b_0028MS_002dDOS_0029_007d-5208"></a><a name="index-grep-_0040r_007b_0028MS_002dDOS_0029_007d-5209"></a>  Because MS-DOS is a single-process &ldquo;operating system&rdquo;,
asynchronous subprocesses are not available.  In particular, Shell
mode and its variants do not work.  Most Emacs features that use
asynchronous subprocesses also don't work on MS-DOS, including
Shell mode and GUD.  When in doubt, try and see; commands that
don't work output an error message saying that asynchronous processes
aren't supported.

   <p>Compilation under Emacs with <kbd>M-x compile</kbd>, searching files with
<kbd>M-x grep</kbd> and displaying differences between files with <kbd>M-x
diff</kbd> do work, by running the inferior processes synchronously.  This
means you cannot do any more editing until the inferior process
finishes.

   <p>Spell checking also works, by means of special support for synchronous
invocation of the <code>ispell</code> program.  This is slower than the
asynchronous invocation on other platforms

   <p>Instead of the Shell mode, which doesn't work on MS-DOS, you can use
the <kbd>M-x eshell</kbd> command.  This invokes the Eshell package that
implements a Posix-like shell entirely in Emacs Lisp.

   <p>By contrast, Emacs compiled as a native Windows application
<strong>does</strong> support asynchronous subprocesses. 
See <a href="#Windows-Processes">Windows Processes</a>.

   <p><a name="index-printing-under-MS_002dDOS-5210"></a>  Printing commands, such as <code>lpr-buffer</code>
(see <a href="#Printing">Printing</a>) and <code>ps-print-buffer</code> (see <a href="#PostScript">PostScript</a>),
work in MS-DOS by sending the output to one of the printer ports. 
See <a href="#MS_002dDOS-Printing">MS-DOS Printing</a>.

   <p>When you run a subprocess synchronously on MS-DOS, make sure the
program terminates and does not try to read keyboard input.  If the
program does not terminate on its own, you will be unable to terminate
it, because MS-DOS provides no general way to terminate a process. 
Pressing <kbd>C-c</kbd> or <kbd>C-&lt;Break&gt;</kbd> might sometimes help in these
cases.

   <p>Accessing files on other machines is not supported on MS-DOS.  Other
network-oriented commands such as sending mail, Web browsing, remote
login, etc., don't work either, unless network access is built into
MS-DOS with some network redirector.

   <p><a name="index-directory-listing-on-MS_002dDOS-5211"></a><a name="index-dired_002dlisting_002dswitches-_0040r_007b_0028MS_002dDOS_0029_007d-5212"></a>  Dired on MS-DOS uses the <code>ls-lisp</code> package
(see <a href="#ls-in-Lisp">ls in Lisp</a>). 
Therefore, Dired on MS-DOS supports only some of the possible options
you can mention in the <code>dired-listing-switches</code> variable.  The
options that work are `<samp><span class="samp">-A</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">-a</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">-c</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">-i</span></samp>',
`<samp><span class="samp">-r</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">-S</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">-s</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">-t</span></samp>', and `<samp><span class="samp">-u</span></samp>'.

<h2 class="unnumbered">The GNU Manifesto</h2>

   <blockquote>
The GNU Manifesto which appears below was written by Richard Stallman at
the beginning of the GNU project, to ask for participation and support. 
For the first few years, it was updated in minor ways to account for
developments, but now it seems best to leave it unchanged as most people
have seen it.

        <p>Since that time, we have learned about certain common misunderstandings
that different wording could help avoid.  Footnotes added in 1993 help
clarify these points.

        <p>For up-to-date information about available GNU software, please see
our web site, <a href="http://www.gnu.org">http://www.gnu.org</a>.  For software tasks and other
ways to contribute, see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/help">http://www.gnu.org/help</a>. 
</blockquote>

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">What's GNU?  Gnu's Not Unix!</h3>

<p>GNU, which stands for Gnu's Not Unix, is the name for the complete
Unix-compatible software system which I am writing so that I can give it
away free to everyone who can use it.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-28" name="fnd-28"><sup>28</sup></a> Several other volunteers are helping
me.  Contributions of time, money, programs and equipment are greatly
needed.

   <p>So far we have an Emacs text editor with Lisp for writing editor commands,
a source level debugger, a yacc-compatible parser generator, a linker, and
around 35 utilities.  A shell (command interpreter) is nearly completed.  A
new portable optimizing C compiler has compiled itself and may be released
this year.  An initial kernel exists but many more features are needed to
emulate Unix.  When the kernel and compiler are finished, it will be
possible to distribute a GNU system suitable for program development.  We
will use TeX as our text formatter, but an nroff is being worked on.  We
will use the free, portable X window system as well.  After this we will
add a portable Common Lisp, an Empire game, a spreadsheet, and hundreds of
other things, plus on-line documentation.  We hope to supply, eventually,
everything useful that normally comes with a Unix system, and more.

   <p>GNU will be able to run Unix programs, but will not be identical to Unix. 
We will make all improvements that are convenient, based on our experience
with other operating systems.  In particular, we plan to have longer
file names, file version numbers, a crashproof file system, file name
completion perhaps, terminal-independent display support, and perhaps
eventually a Lisp-based window system through which several Lisp programs
and ordinary Unix programs can share a screen.  Both C and Lisp will be
available as system programming languages.  We will try to support UUCP,
MIT Chaosnet, and Internet protocols for communication.

   <p>GNU is aimed initially at machines in the 68000/16000 class with virtual
memory, because they are the easiest machines to make it run on.  The extra
effort to make it run on smaller machines will be left to someone who wants
to use it on them.

   <p>To avoid horrible confusion, please pronounce the &ldquo;G&rdquo; in the word &ldquo;GNU&rdquo;
when it is the name of this project.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Why I Must Write GNU</h3>

<p>I consider that the golden rule requires that if I like a program I must
share it with other people who like it.  Software sellers want to divide
the users and conquer them, making each user agree not to share with
others.  I refuse to break solidarity with other users in this way.  I
cannot in good conscience sign a nondisclosure agreement or a software
license agreement.  For years I worked within the Artificial Intelligence
Lab to resist such tendencies and other inhospitalities, but eventually
they had gone too far: I could not remain in an institution where such
things are done for me against my will.

   <p>So that I can continue to use computers without dishonor, I have decided to
put together a sufficient body of free software so that I will be able to
get along without any software that is not free.  I have resigned from the
AI lab to deny MIT any legal excuse to prevent me from giving GNU away.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Why GNU Will Be Compatible with Unix</h3>

<p>Unix is not my ideal system, but it is not too bad.  The essential features
of Unix seem to be good ones, and I think I can fill in what Unix lacks
without spoiling them.  And a system compatible with Unix would be
convenient for many other people to adopt.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">How GNU Will Be Available</h3>

<p>GNU is not in the public domain.  Everyone will be permitted to modify and
redistribute GNU, but no distributor will be allowed to restrict its
further redistribution.  That is to say, proprietary modifications will not
be allowed.  I want to make sure that all versions of GNU remain free.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Why Many Other Programmers Want to Help</h3>

<p>I have found many other programmers who are excited about GNU and want to
help.

   <p>Many programmers are unhappy about the commercialization of system
software.  It may enable them to make more money, but it requires them to
feel in conflict with other programmers in general rather than feel as
comrades.  The fundamental act of friendship among programmers is the
sharing of programs; marketing arrangements now typically used essentially
forbid programmers to treat others as friends.  The purchaser of software
must choose between friendship and obeying the law.  Naturally, many decide
that friendship is more important.  But those who believe in law often do
not feel at ease with either choice.  They become cynical and think that
programming is just a way of making money.

   <p>By working on and using GNU rather than proprietary programs, we can be
hospitable to everyone and obey the law.  In addition, GNU serves as an
example to inspire and a banner to rally others to join us in sharing. 
This can give us a feeling of harmony which is impossible if we use
software that is not free.  For about half the programmers I talk to, this
is an important happiness that money cannot replace.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">How You Can Contribute</h3>

<p>I am asking computer manufacturers for donations of machines and money. 
I'm asking individuals for donations of programs and work.

   <p>One consequence you can expect if you donate machines is that GNU will run
on them at an early date.  The machines should be complete, ready to use
systems, approved for use in a residential area, and not in need of
sophisticated cooling or power.

   <p>I have found very many programmers eager to contribute part-time work for
GNU.  For most projects, such part-time distributed work would be very hard
to coordinate; the independently-written parts would not work together. 
But for the particular task of replacing Unix, this problem is absent.  A
complete Unix system contains hundreds of utility programs, each of which
is documented separately.  Most interface specifications are fixed by Unix
compatibility.  If each contributor can write a compatible replacement for
a single Unix utility, and make it work properly in place of the original
on a Unix system, then these utilities will work right when put together. 
Even allowing for Murphy to create a few unexpected problems, assembling
these components will be a feasible task.  (The kernel will require closer
communication and will be worked on by a small, tight group.)

   <p>If I get donations of money, I may be able to hire a few people full or
part time.  The salary won't be high by programmers' standards, but I'm
looking for people for whom building community spirit is as important as
making money.  I view this as a way of enabling dedicated people to devote
their full energies to working on GNU by sparing them the need to make a
living in another way.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Why All Computer Users Will Benefit</h3>

<p>Once GNU is written, everyone will be able to obtain good system
software free, just like air.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-29" name="fnd-29"><sup>29</sup></a>

   <p>This means much more than just saving everyone the price of a Unix license. 
It means that much wasteful duplication of system programming effort will
be avoided.  This effort can go instead into advancing the state of the
art.

   <p>Complete system sources will be available to everyone.  As a result, a user
who needs changes in the system will always be free to make them himself,
or hire any available programmer or company to make them for him.  Users
will no longer be at the mercy of one programmer or company which owns the
sources and is in sole position to make changes.

   <p>Schools will be able to provide a much more educational environment by
encouraging all students to study and improve the system code.  Harvard's
computer lab used to have the policy that no program could be installed on
the system if its sources were not on public display, and upheld it by
actually refusing to install certain programs.  I was very much inspired by
this.

   <p>Finally, the overhead of considering who owns the system software and what
one is or is not entitled to do with it will be lifted.

   <p>Arrangements to make people pay for using a program, including licensing of
copies, always incur a tremendous cost to society through the cumbersome
mechanisms necessary to figure out how much (that is, which programs) a
person must pay for.  And only a police state can force everyone to obey
them.  Consider a space station where air must be manufactured at great
cost: charging each breather per liter of air may be fair, but wearing the
metered gas mask all day and all night is intolerable even if everyone can
afford to pay the air bill.  And the TV cameras everywhere to see if you
ever take the mask off are outrageous.  It's better to support the air
plant with a head tax and chuck the masks.

   <p>Copying all or parts of a program is as natural to a programmer as
breathing, and as productive.  It ought to be as free.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Some Easily Rebutted Objections to GNU's Goals</h3>

<blockquote>
&ldquo;Nobody will use it if it is free, because that means they can't rely
on any support.&rdquo;

        <p>&ldquo;You have to charge for the program to pay for providing the
support.&rdquo;
</blockquote>

   <p>If people would rather pay for GNU plus service than get GNU free without
service, a company to provide just service to people who have obtained GNU
free ought to be profitable.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-30" name="fnd-30"><sup>30</sup></a>

   <p>We must distinguish between support in the form of real programming work
and mere handholding.  The former is something one cannot rely on from a
software vendor.  If your problem is not shared by enough people, the
vendor will tell you to get lost.

   <p>If your business needs to be able to rely on support, the only way is to
have all the necessary sources and tools.  Then you can hire any available
person to fix your problem; you are not at the mercy of any individual. 
With Unix, the price of sources puts this out of consideration for most
businesses.  With GNU this will be easy.  It is still possible for there to
be no available competent person, but this problem cannot be blamed on
distribution arrangements.  GNU does not eliminate all the world's problems,
only some of them.

   <p>Meanwhile, the users who know nothing about computers need handholding:
doing things for them which they could easily do themselves but don't know
how.

   <p>Such services could be provided by companies that sell just hand-holding
and repair service.  If it is true that users would rather spend money and
get a product with service, they will also be willing to buy the service
having got the product free.  The service companies will compete in quality
and price; users will not be tied to any particular one.  Meanwhile, those
of us who don't need the service should be able to use the program without
paying for the service.

   <blockquote>
&ldquo;You cannot reach many people without advertising,
and you must charge for the program to support that.&rdquo;

        <p>&ldquo;It's no use advertising a program people can get free.&rdquo;
</blockquote>

   <p>There are various forms of free or very cheap publicity that can be used to
inform numbers of computer users about something like GNU.  But it may be
true that one can reach more microcomputer users with advertising.  If this
is really so, a business which advertises the service of copying and
mailing GNU for a fee ought to be successful enough to pay for its
advertising and more.  This way, only the users who benefit from the
advertising pay for it.

   <p>On the other hand, if many people get GNU from their friends, and such
companies don't succeed, this will show that advertising was not really
necessary to spread GNU.  Why is it that free market advocates don't
want to let the free market decide this?<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-31" name="fnd-31"><sup>31</sup></a>

   <blockquote>
&ldquo;My company needs a proprietary operating system
to get a competitive edge.&rdquo;
</blockquote>

   <p>GNU will remove operating system software from the realm of competition. 
You will not be able to get an edge in this area, but neither will your
competitors be able to get an edge over you.  You and they will compete in
other areas, while benefiting mutually in this one.  If your business is
selling an operating system, you will not like GNU, but that's tough on
you.  If your business is something else, GNU can save you from being
pushed into the expensive business of selling operating systems.

   <p>I would like to see GNU development supported by gifts from many
manufacturers and users, reducing the cost to each.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-32" name="fnd-32"><sup>32</sup></a>

   <blockquote>
&ldquo;Don't programmers deserve a reward for their creativity?&rdquo;
</blockquote>

   <p>If anything deserves a reward, it is social contribution.  Creativity can
be a social contribution, but only in so far as society is free to use the
results.  If programmers deserve to be rewarded for creating innovative
programs, by the same token they deserve to be punished if they restrict
the use of these programs.

   <blockquote>
&ldquo;Shouldn't a programmer be able to ask for a reward for his creativity?&rdquo;
</blockquote>

   <p>There is nothing wrong with wanting pay for work, or seeking to maximize
one's income, as long as one does not use means that are destructive.  But
the means customary in the field of software today are based on
destruction.

   <p>Extracting money from users of a program by restricting their use of it is
destructive because the restrictions reduce the amount and the ways that
the program can be used.  This reduces the amount of wealth that humanity
derives from the program.  When there is a deliberate choice to restrict,
the harmful consequences are deliberate destruction.

   <p>The reason a good citizen does not use such destructive means to become
wealthier is that, if everyone did so, we would all become poorer from the
mutual destructiveness.  This is Kantian ethics; or, the Golden Rule. 
Since I do not like the consequences that result if everyone hoards
information, I am required to consider it wrong for one to do so. 
Specifically, the desire to be rewarded for one's creativity does not
justify depriving the world in general of all or part of that creativity.

   <blockquote>
&ldquo;Won't programmers starve?&rdquo;
</blockquote>

   <p>I could answer that nobody is forced to be a programmer.  Most of us cannot
manage to get any money for standing on the street and making faces.  But
we are not, as a result, condemned to spend our lives standing on the
street making faces, and starving.  We do something else.

   <p>But that is the wrong answer because it accepts the questioner's implicit
assumption: that without ownership of software, programmers cannot possibly
be paid a cent.  Supposedly it is all or nothing.

   <p>The real reason programmers will not starve is that it will still be
possible for them to get paid for programming; just not paid as much as
now.

   <p>Restricting copying is not the only basis for business in software.  It is
the most common basis because it brings in the most money.  If it were
prohibited, or rejected by the customer, software business would move to
other bases of organization which are now used less often.  There are
always numerous ways to organize any kind of business.

   <p>Probably programming will not be as lucrative on the new basis as it is
now.  But that is not an argument against the change.  It is not considered
an injustice that sales clerks make the salaries that they now do.  If
programmers made the same, that would not be an injustice either.  (In
practice they would still make considerably more than that.)

   <blockquote>
&ldquo;Don't people have a right to control how their creativity is used?&rdquo;
</blockquote>

   <p>&ldquo;Control over the use of one's ideas&rdquo; really constitutes control over
other people's lives; and it is usually used to make their lives more
difficult.

   <p>People who have studied the issue of intellectual property
rights<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-33" name="fnd-33"><sup>33</sup></a> carefully
(such as lawyers) say that there is no intrinsic right to intellectual
property.  The kinds of supposed intellectual property rights that the
government recognizes were created by specific acts of legislation for
specific purposes.

   <p>For example, the patent system was established to encourage inventors to
disclose the details of their inventions.  Its purpose was to help society
rather than to help inventors.  At the time, the life span of 17 years for
a patent was short compared with the rate of advance of the state of the
art.  Since patents are an issue only among manufacturers, for whom the
cost and effort of a license agreement are small compared with setting up
production, the patents often do not do much harm.  They do not obstruct
most individuals who use patented products.

   <p>The idea of copyright did not exist in ancient times, when authors
frequently copied other authors at length in works of non-fiction.  This
practice was useful, and is the only way many authors' works have survived
even in part.  The copyright system was created expressly for the purpose
of encouraging authorship.  In the domain for which it was
invented&mdash;books, which could be copied economically only on a printing
press&mdash;it did little harm, and did not obstruct most of the individuals
who read the books.

   <p>All intellectual property rights are just licenses granted by society
because it was thought, rightly or wrongly, that society as a whole would
benefit by granting them.  But in any particular situation, we have to ask:
are we really better off granting such license?  What kind of act are we
licensing a person to do?

   <p>The case of programs today is very different from that of books a hundred
years ago.  The fact that the easiest way to copy a program is from one
neighbor to another, the fact that a program has both source code and
object code which are distinct, and the fact that a program is used rather
than read and enjoyed, combine to create a situation in which a person who
enforces a copyright is harming society as a whole both materially and
spiritually; in which a person should not do so regardless of whether the
law enables him to.

   <blockquote>
&ldquo;Competition makes things get done better.&rdquo;
</blockquote>

   <p>The paradigm of competition is a race: by rewarding the winner, we
encourage everyone to run faster.  When capitalism really works this way,
it does a good job; but its defenders are wrong in assuming it always works
this way.  If the runners forget why the reward is offered and become
intent on winning, no matter how, they may find other strategies&mdash;such as,
attacking other runners.  If the runners get into a fist fight, they will
all finish late.

   <p>Proprietary and secret software is the moral equivalent of runners in a
fist fight.  Sad to say, the only referee we've got does not seem to
object to fights; he just regulates them (&ldquo;For every ten yards you run,
you can fire one shot&rdquo;).  He really ought to break them up, and penalize
runners for even trying to fight.

   <blockquote>
&ldquo;Won't everyone stop programming without a monetary incentive?&rdquo;
</blockquote>

   <p>Actually, many people will program with absolutely no monetary incentive. 
Programming has an irresistible fascination for some people, usually the
people who are best at it.  There is no shortage of professional musicians
who keep at it even though they have no hope of making a living that way.

   <p>But really this question, though commonly asked, is not appropriate to the
situation.  Pay for programmers will not disappear, only become less.  So
the right question is, will anyone program with a reduced monetary
incentive?  My experience shows that they will.

   <p>For more than ten years, many of the world's best programmers worked at the
Artificial Intelligence Lab for far less money than they could have had
anywhere else.  They got many kinds of non-monetary rewards: fame and
appreciation, for example.  And creativity is also fun, a reward in itself.

   <p>Then most of them left when offered a chance to do the same interesting
work for a lot of money.

   <p>What the facts show is that people will program for reasons other than
riches; but if given a chance to make a lot of money as well, they will
come to expect and demand it.  Low-paying organizations do poorly in
competition with high-paying ones, but they do not have to do badly if the
high-paying ones are banned.

   <blockquote>
&ldquo;We need the programmers desperately.  If they demand that we
stop helping our neighbors, we have to obey.&rdquo;
</blockquote>

   <p>You're never so desperate that you have to obey this sort of demand. 
Remember: millions for defense, but not a cent for tribute!

   <blockquote>
&ldquo;Programmers need to make a living somehow.&rdquo;
</blockquote>

   <p>In the short run, this is true.  However, there are plenty of ways that
programmers could make a living without selling the right to use a program. 
This way is customary now because it brings programmers and businessmen the
most money, not because it is the only way to make a living.  It is easy to
find other ways if you want to find them.  Here are a number of examples.

   <p>A manufacturer introducing a new computer will pay for the porting of
operating systems onto the new hardware.

   <p>The sale of teaching, hand-holding and maintenance services could also
employ programmers.

   <p>People with new ideas could distribute programs as
freeware<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-34" name="fnd-34"><sup>34</sup></a>, asking for donations from satisfied users, or selling
hand-holding services.  I have met people who are already working this
way successfully.

   <p>Users with related needs can form users' groups, and pay dues.  A group
would contract with programming companies to write programs that the
group's members would like to use.

   <p>All sorts of development can be funded with a Software Tax:

   <blockquote>
Suppose everyone who buys a computer has to pay x percent of
the price as a software tax.  The government gives this to
an agency like the NSF to spend on software development.

        <p>But if the computer buyer makes a donation to software development
himself, he can take a credit against the tax.  He can donate to
the project of his own choosing&mdash;often, chosen because he hopes to
use the results when it is done.  He can take a credit for any amount
of donation up to the total tax he had to pay.

        <p>The total tax rate could be decided by a vote of the payers of
the tax, weighted according to the amount they will be taxed on.

        <p>The consequences:

          <ul>
<li>The computer-using community supports software development. 
<li>This community decides what level of support is needed. 
<li>Users who care which projects their share is spent on
can choose this for themselves. 
</ul>
   </blockquote>

   <p>In the long run, making programs free is a step toward the post-scarcity
world, where nobody will have to work very hard just to make a living. 
People will be free to devote themselves to activities that are fun, such
as programming, after spending the necessary ten hours a week on required
tasks such as legislation, family counseling, robot repair and asteroid
prospecting.  There will be no need to be able to make a living from
programming.

   <p>We have already greatly reduced the amount of work that the whole society
must do for its actual productivity, but only a little of this has
translated itself into leisure for workers because much nonproductive
activity is required to accompany productive activity.  The main causes of
this are bureaucracy and isometric struggles against competition.  Free
software will greatly reduce these drains in the area of software
production.  We must do this, in order for technical gains in productivity
to translate into less work for us.

<a name="Glossary_002d_002d_002dAbbrev"></a>
<dt>Abbrev<dd>An abbrev is a text string that expands into a different text string
when present in the buffer.  For example, you might define a few letters
as an abbrev for a long phrase that you want to insert frequently. 
See <a href="#Abbrevs">Abbrevs</a>.

     <br><dt>Aborting<dd>Aborting means getting out of a recursive edit (q.v.).  The
commands <kbd>C-]</kbd> and <kbd>M-x top-level</kbd> are used for this. 
See <a href="#Quitting">Quitting</a>.

     <br><dt>Active Region<dd>Setting the mark (q.v.) at a position in the text also activates it. 
When the mark is active, we call the region an active region. 
See <a href="#Mark">Mark</a>.

     <br><dt>Alt<dd>Alt is the name of a modifier bit that a keyboard input character may
have.  To make a character Alt, type it while holding down the &lt;Alt&gt;
key.  Such characters are given names that start with <kbd>&lt;Alt&gt;-</kbd>
(usually written <kbd>A-</kbd> for short).  (Note that many terminals have a
key labeled &lt;Alt&gt; that is really a &lt;META&gt; key.)  See <a href="#User-Input">Alt</a>.

     <br><dt>Argument<dd>See <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dNumeric-Argument">Glossary&mdash;Numeric Argument</a>.

     <br><dt><acronym>ASCII</acronym> character<dd>An <acronym>ASCII</acronym> character is either an <acronym>ASCII</acronym> control
character or an <acronym>ASCII</acronym> printing character.  See <a href="#User-Input">User Input</a>.

     <br><dt><acronym>ASCII</acronym> control character<dd>An <acronym>ASCII</acronym> control character is the Control version of an upper-case
letter, or the Control version of one of the characters `<samp><span class="samp">@[\]^_?</span></samp>'.

     <br><dt><acronym>ASCII</acronym> printing character<dd><acronym>ASCII</acronym> letters, digits, space, and the following punctuation
characters: `<samp><span class="samp">!@#$%^&amp;*()_-+=|\~`{}[]:;"'&lt;&gt;,.?/</span></samp>'.

     <br><dt>Auto Fill Mode<dd>Auto Fill mode is a minor mode (q.v.) in which text that you insert is
automatically broken into lines of a given maximum width. 
See <a href="#Filling">Filling</a>.

     <br><dt>Auto Saving<dd>Auto saving is the practice of periodically saving the contents of an
Emacs buffer in a specially-named file, so that the information will
be preserved if the buffer is lost due to a system error or user error. 
See <a href="#Auto-Save">Auto Save</a>.

     <br><dt>Autoloading<dd>Emacs can automatically load Lisp libraries when a Lisp program requests a
function from those libraries.  This is called &ldquo;autoloading&rdquo;. 
See <a href="#Lisp-Libraries">Lisp Libraries</a>.

     <br><dt>Backtrace<dd>A backtrace is a trace of a series of function calls showing how a
program arrived at a certain point.  It is used mainly for finding and
correcting bugs (q.v.).  Emacs can display a backtrace when it signals
an error or when you type <kbd>C-g</kbd> (see <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dQuitting">Glossary&mdash;Quitting</a>). 
See <a href="#Checklist">Checklist</a>.

     <br><dt>Backup File<dd>A backup file records the contents that a file had before the current
editing session.  Emacs makes backup files automatically to help you
track down or cancel changes you later regret making.  See <a href="#Backup">Backup</a>.

     <br><dt>Balancing Parentheses<dd>Emacs can balance parentheses (or other matching delimiters) either
manually or automatically.  You do manual balancing with the commands
to move over parenthetical groupings (see <a href="#Moving-by-Parens">Moving by Parens</a>). 
Automatic balancing works by blinking or highlighting the delimiter
that matches the one you just inserted, or inserting the matching
delimiter for you (see <a href="#Matching">Matching Parens</a>).

     <p><a name="Glossary_002d_002d_002dBalanced-Expression"></a>
<br><dt>Balanced Expressions<dd>A balanced expression is a syntactically recognizable expression, such
as a symbol, number, string constant, block, or parenthesized expression
in C.  See <a href="#Expressions">Balanced Expressions</a>.

     <br><dt>Balloon Help<dd>See <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dTooltips">Glossary&mdash;Tooltips</a>.

     <br><dt>Base Buffer<dd>A base buffer is a buffer whose text is shared by an indirect buffer
(q.v.).

     <br><dt>Bidirectional Text<dd>Some human languages, such as English, are written from left to right. 
Others, such as Arabic, are written from right to left.  Emacs
supports both of these forms, as well as any mixture of them&mdash;this
is &ldquo;bidirectional text&rdquo;.  See <a href="#Bidirectional-Editing">Bidirectional Editing</a>.

     <br><dt>Bind<dd>To bind a key sequence means to give it a binding (q.v.). 
See <a href="#Rebinding">Rebinding</a>.

     <p><a name="Glossary_002d_002d_002dBinding"></a>
<br><dt>Binding<dd>A key sequence gets its meaning in Emacs by having a binding, which is a
command (q.v.), a Lisp function that is run when you type that
sequence.  See <a href="#Commands">Binding</a>.  Customization often involves
rebinding a character to a different command function.  The bindings of
all key sequences are recorded in the keymaps (q.v.).  See <a href="#Keymaps">Keymaps</a>.

     <br><dt>Blank Lines<dd>Blank lines are lines that contain only whitespace.  Emacs has several
commands for operating on the blank lines in the buffer.  See <a href="#Blank-Lines">Blank Lines</a>.

     <br><dt>Bookmark<dd>Bookmarks are akin to registers (q.v.) in that they record positions
in buffers to which you can return later.  Unlike registers, bookmarks
persist between Emacs sessions.  See <a href="#Bookmarks">Bookmarks</a>.

     <br><dt>Border<dd>A border is a thin space along the edge of the frame, used just for
spacing, not for displaying anything.  An Emacs frame has an ordinary
external border, outside of everything including the menu bar, plus an
internal border that surrounds the text windows, their scroll bars
and fringes, and separates them from the menu bar and tool bar.  You
can customize both borders with options and resources (see <a href="#Borders-X">Borders X</a>).  Borders are not the same as fringes (q.v.).

     <br><dt>Buffer<dd>The buffer is the basic editing unit; one buffer corresponds to one text
being edited.  You normally have several buffers, but at any time you are
editing only one, the current buffer, though several can be visible
when you are using multiple windows or frames (q.v.).  Most buffers
are visiting (q.v.) some file.  See <a href="#Buffers">Buffers</a>.

     <br><dt>Buffer Selection History<dd>Emacs keeps a buffer selection history that records how recently each
Emacs buffer has been selected.  This is used for choosing a buffer to
select.  See <a href="#Buffers">Buffers</a>.

     <br><dt>Bug<dd>A bug is an incorrect or unreasonable behavior of a program, or
inaccurate or confusing documentation.  Emacs developers treat bug
reports, both in Emacs code and its documentation, very seriously and
ask you to report any bugs you find.  See <a href="#Bugs">Bugs</a>.

     <br><dt>Button Down Event<dd>A button down event is the kind of input event (q.v.) generated
right away when you press down on a mouse button.  See <a href="#Mouse-Buttons">Mouse Buttons</a>.

     <br><dt>By Default<dd>See <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dDefault">Glossary&mdash;Default</a>.

     <br><dt>Byte Compilation<dd>See <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dCompilation">Glossary&mdash;Compilation</a>.

     <p><a name="Glossary_002d_002d_002dC_002d"></a>
<br><dt><kbd>C-</kbd><dd><kbd>C-</kbd> in the name of a character is an abbreviation for Control. 
See <a href="#User-Input">C-</a>.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-M-</kbd><dd><kbd>C-M-</kbd> in the name of a character is an abbreviation for
Control-Meta.  If your terminal lacks a real &lt;META&gt; key, you type
a Control-Meta character by typing &lt;ESC&gt; and then typing the
corresponding Control character.  See <a href="#User-Input">C-M-</a>.

     <br><dt>Case Conversion<dd>Case conversion means changing text from upper case to lower case or
vice versa.  See <a href="#Case">Case</a>.

     <br><dt>Case Folding<dd>Case folding means ignoring the differences between case variants of
the same letter: upper-case, lower-case, and title-case.  Emacs
performs case folding by default in text search.  See <a href="#Lax-Search">Lax Search</a>.

     <br><dt>Character<dd>Characters form the contents of an Emacs buffer.  Also, key sequences
(q.v.) are usually made up of characters (though they may include
other input events as well).  See <a href="#User-Input">User Input</a>.

     <br><dt>Character Folding<dd>Character folding means ignoring differences between similarly looking
characters, such as between <code>a</code>, and <code>a</code> and <code>&aacute;</code>. 
Emacs performs character folding by default in text search.  See <a href="#Lax-Search">Lax Search</a>.

     <br><dt>Character Set<dd>Emacs supports a number of character sets, each of which represents a
particular alphabet or script.  See <a href="#International">International</a>.

     <br><dt>Character Terminal<dd>See <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dText-Terminal">Glossary&mdash;Text Terminal</a>.

     <br><dt>Click Event<dd>A click event is the kind of input event (q.v.) generated when you
press a mouse button and release it without moving the mouse. 
See <a href="#Mouse-Buttons">Mouse Buttons</a>.

     <br><dt>Client<dd>See <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dServer">Glossary&mdash;Server</a>.

     <br><dt>Clipboard<dd>A clipboard is a buffer provided by the window system for transferring
text between applications.  On the X Window System, the clipboard is
provided in addition to the primary selection (q.v.); on MS-Windows and Mac,
the clipboard is used <em>instead</em> of the primary selection. 
See <a href="#Clipboard">Clipboard</a>.

     <br><dt>Coding System<dd>A coding system is an encoding for representing text characters in a
file or in a stream of information.  Emacs has the ability to convert
text to or from a variety of coding systems when reading or writing it. 
See <a href="#Coding-Systems">Coding Systems</a>.

     <br><dt>Command<dd>A command is a Lisp function specially defined to be able to serve as a
key binding in Emacs.  When you type a key sequence (q.v.), its
binding (q.v.) is looked up in the relevant keymaps (q.v.) to find
the command to run.  See <a href="#Commands">Commands</a>.

     <br><dt>Command History<dd>See <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dMinibuffer-History">Glossary&mdash;Minibuffer History</a>.

     <br><dt>Command Name<dd>A command name is the name of a Lisp symbol that is a command
(see <a href="#Commands">Commands</a>).  You can invoke any command by its name using
<kbd>M-x</kbd> (see <a href="#M_002dx">M-x</a>).

     <br><dt>Comment<dd>A comment is text in a program which is intended only for humans reading
the program, and which is specially marked so that it will be ignored
when the program is loaded or compiled.  Emacs offers special commands
for creating, aligning and killing comments.  See <a href="#Comments">Comments</a>.

     <br><dt>Common Lisp<dd>Common Lisp is a dialect of Lisp (q.v.) much larger and more powerful
than Emacs Lisp.  Emacs provides a subset of Common Lisp in the CL
package.  See <a href="cl.html#Top">Common Lisp</a>.

     <p><a name="Glossary_002d_002d_002dCompilation"></a>
<br><dt>Compilation<dd>Compilation is the process of creating an executable program from source
code.  Emacs has commands for compiling files of Emacs Lisp code
(see <a href="elisp.html#Byte-Compilation">Byte Compilation</a>) and programs in C and other languages
(see <a href="#Compilation">Compilation</a>).

     <br><dt>Complete Key<dd>A complete key is a key sequence that fully specifies one action to be
performed by Emacs.  For example, <kbd>X</kbd> and <kbd>C-f</kbd> and <kbd>C-x m</kbd>
are complete keys.  Complete keys derive their meanings from being bound
(q.v.) to commands (q.v.).  Thus, <kbd>X</kbd> is conventionally bound to
a command to insert `<samp><span class="samp">X</span></samp>' in the buffer; <kbd>C-x m</kbd> is
conventionally bound to a command to begin composing a mail message. 
See <a href="#Keys">Keys</a>.

     <br><dt>Completion<dd>Completion is what Emacs does when it automatically expands an
abbreviation for a name into the entire name.  Completion is done for
minibuffer (q.v.) arguments when the set of possible valid inputs
is known; for example, on command names, buffer names, and
file names.  Completion usually occurs when &lt;TAB&gt;, &lt;SPC&gt; or
&lt;RET&gt; is typed.  See <a href="#Completion">Completion</a>.

     <p><a name="Glossary_002d_002d_002dContinuation-Line"></a>
<br><dt>Continuation Line<dd>When a line of text is longer than the width of the window, it
normally (but see <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dTruncation">Glossary&mdash;Truncation</a>) takes up more than one
screen line when displayed.  We say that the text line is continued, and all
screen lines used for it after the first are called continuation
lines.  See <a href="#Continuation-Lines">Continuation Lines</a>.  A related Emacs feature is
filling (q.v.).

     <br><dt>Control Character<dd>A control character is a character that you type by holding down the
&lt;Ctrl&gt; key.  Some control characters also have their own keys, so
that you can type them without using &lt;Ctrl&gt;.  For example,
&lt;RET&gt;, &lt;TAB&gt;, &lt;ESC&gt; and &lt;DEL&gt; are all control
characters.  See <a href="#User-Input">User Input</a>.

     <br><dt>Copyleft<dd>A copyleft is a notice giving the public legal permission to
redistribute and modify a program or other work of art, but requiring
modified versions to carry similar permission.  Copyright is normally
used to keep users divided and helpless; with copyleft we turn that
around to empower users and encourage them to cooperate.

     <p>The particular form of copyleft used by the GNU project is called the
GNU General Public License.  See <a href="#Copying">Copying</a>.

     <br><dt>&lt;Ctrl&gt;<dd>The &lt;Ctrl&gt; or control key is what you hold down
in order to enter a control character (q.v.).  See <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dC_002d">Glossary&mdash;C-</a>.

     <br><dt>Current Buffer<dd>The current buffer in Emacs is the Emacs buffer on which most editing
commands operate.  You can select any Emacs buffer as the current one. 
See <a href="#Buffers">Buffers</a>.

     <br><dt>Current Line<dd>The current line is the line that point is on (see <a href="#Point">Point</a>).

     <br><dt>Current Paragraph<dd>The current paragraph is the paragraph that point is in.  If point is
between two paragraphs, the current paragraph is the one that follows
point.  See <a href="#Paragraphs">Paragraphs</a>.

     <br><dt>Current Defun<dd>The current defun is the defun (q.v.) that point is in.  If point is
between defuns, the current defun is the one that follows point. 
See <a href="#Defuns">Defuns</a>.

     <br><dt>Cursor<dd>The cursor is the rectangle on the screen which indicates the position
(called point; q.v.) at which insertion and deletion takes place. 
The cursor is on or under the character that follows point.  Often
people speak of &ldquo;the cursor&rdquo; when, strictly speaking, they mean
&ldquo;point&rdquo;.  See <a href="#Point">Cursor</a>.

     <br><dt>Customization<dd>Customization is making minor changes in the way Emacs works, to
reflect your preferences or needs.  It is often done by setting
variables (see <a href="#Variables">Variables</a>) or faces (see <a href="#Face-Customization">Face Customization</a>),
or by rebinding key sequences (see <a href="#Keymaps">Keymaps</a>).

     <p><a name="index-cut-and-paste-5214"></a><br><dt>Cut and Paste<dd>See <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dKilling">Glossary&mdash;Killing</a>, and <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dYanking">Glossary&mdash;Yanking</a>.

     <p><a name="Glossary_002d_002d_002dDaemon"></a>
<br><dt>Daemon<dd>A daemon is a standard term for a system-level process that runs in the
background.  Daemons are often started when the system first starts up. 
When Emacs runs in daemon-mode, it runs in the background and does not
open a display.  You can then connect to it with the
<samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp> program.  See <a href="#Emacs-Server">Emacs Server</a>.

     <br><dt>Default Argument<dd>The default for an argument is the value that will be assumed if you
do not specify one.  When the minibuffer is used to read an argument,
the default argument is used if you just type &lt;RET&gt;. 
See <a href="#Minibuffer">Minibuffer</a>.

     <p><a name="Glossary_002d_002d_002dDefault"></a>
<br><dt>Default<dd>A default is the value that is used for a certain purpose when
you do not explicitly specify a value to use.

     <br><dt>Default Directory<dd>When you specify a file name that does not start with `<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">~</span></samp>',
it is interpreted relative to the current buffer's default directory. 
(On MS systems, file names that start with a drive letter
`<samp><var>x</var><span class="samp">:</span></samp>' are treated as absolute, not relative.) 
See <a href="#Minibuffer-File">Default Directory</a>.

     <br><dt>Defun<dd>A defun is a major definition at the top level in a program.  The name
&ldquo;defun&rdquo; comes from Lisp, where most such definitions use the construct
<code>defun</code>.  See <a href="#Defuns">Defuns</a>.

     <br><dt>&lt;DEL&gt;<dd>&lt;DEL&gt; is a character that runs the command to delete one character
of text before the cursor.  It is typically either the &lt;Delete&gt;
key or the &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; key, whichever one is easy to type. 
See <a href="#Erasing">DEL</a>.

     <br><dt>Deletion<dd>Deletion means erasing text without copying it into the kill ring
(q.v.).  The alternative is killing (q.v.).  See <a href="#Killing">Deletion</a>.

     <p><a name="Glossary_002d_002d_002dDeletion-of-Files"></a>
<br><dt>Deletion of Files<dd>Deleting a file means erasing it from the file system. 
(Note that some systems use the concept of a trash can, or recycle
bin, to allow you to undelete files.) 
See <a href="#Misc-File-Ops">Misc File Ops</a>.

     <br><dt>Deletion of Messages<dd>Deleting a message (in Rmail, and other mail clients) means flagging
it to be eliminated from your mail file.  Until you expunge (q.v.) 
the Rmail file, you can still undelete the messages you have deleted. 
See <a href="#Rmail-Deletion">Rmail Deletion</a>.

     <br><dt>Deletion of Windows<dd>Deleting a window means eliminating it from the screen.  Other windows
expand to use up the space.  The text that was in the window is not
lost, and you can create a new window with the same dimensions as the
old if you wish.  See <a href="#Windows">Windows</a>.

     <br><dt>Directory<dd>File directories are named collections in the file system, within which
you can place individual files or subdirectories.  They are sometimes
referred to as &ldquo;folders&rdquo;.  See <a href="#Directories">Directories</a>.

     <p><a name="Glossary_002d_002d_002dDirectory-Local-Variable"></a>
<br><dt>Directory Local Variable<dd>A directory local variable is a local variable (q.v.) that applies
to all the files within a certain directory.  See <a href="#Directory-Variables">Directory Variables</a>.

     <br><dt>Dired<dd>Dired is the Emacs facility that displays the contents of a file
directory and allows you to &ldquo;edit the directory&rdquo;, performing
operations on the files in the directory.  See <a href="#Dired">Dired</a>.

     <br><dt>Disabled Command<dd>A disabled command is one that you may not run without special
confirmation.  The usual reason for disabling a command is that it is
confusing for beginning users.  See <a href="#Disabling">Disabling</a>.

     <br><dt>Down Event<dd>Short for &ldquo;button down event&rdquo; (q.v.).

     <br><dt>Drag Event<dd>A drag event is the kind of input event (q.v.) generated when you
press a mouse button, move the mouse, and then release the button. 
See <a href="#Mouse-Buttons">Mouse Buttons</a>.

     <br><dt>Dribble File<dd>A dribble file is a file into which Emacs writes all the characters that
you type on the keyboard.  Dribble files can be used to make a record
for debugging Emacs bugs.  Emacs does not make a dribble file unless you
tell it to.  See <a href="#Bugs">Bugs</a>.

     <!-- TODO?  Not really appropriate for the user manual I think. -->
<!-- Dynamic Binding -->
<br><dt>Echo Area<dd>The echo area is the bottom line of the screen, used for echoing the
arguments to commands, for asking questions, and showing brief messages
(including error messages).  The messages are stored in the buffer
<samp><span class="file">*Messages*</span></samp> so you can review them later.  See <a href="#Echo-Area">Echo Area</a>.

     <br><dt>Echoing<dd>Echoing is acknowledging the receipt of input events by displaying
them (in the echo area).  Emacs never echoes single-character key
sequences; longer key sequences echo only if you pause while typing
them.

     <br><dt>Electric<dd>We say that a character is electric if it is normally self-inserting
(q.v.), but the current major mode (q.v.) redefines it to do something
else as well.  For example, some programming language major modes define
particular delimiter characters to reindent the line, or insert one or
more newlines in addition to self-insertion.

     <p><a name="Glossary_002d_002d_002dEnd-Of-Line"></a>
<br><dt>End Of Line<dd>End of line is a character or a sequence of characters that indicate
the end of a text line.  On GNU and Unix systems, this is a newline
(q.v.), but other systems have other conventions.  See <a href="#Coding-Systems">end-of-line</a>.  Emacs can recognize several end-of-line
conventions in files and convert between them.

     <br><dt>Environment Variable<dd>An environment variable is one of a collection of variables stored by
the operating system, each one having a name and a value.  Emacs can
access environment variables set by its parent shell, and it can set
variables in the environment it passes to programs it invokes. 
See <a href="#Environment">Environment</a>.

     <br><dt>EOL<dd>See <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dEnd-Of-Line">Glossary&mdash;End Of Line</a>.

     <br><dt>Error<dd>An error occurs when an Emacs command cannot execute in the current
circumstances.  When an error occurs, execution of the command stops
(unless the command has been programmed to do otherwise) and Emacs
reports the error by displaying an error message (q.v.). 
<!-- Not helpful? -->
<!-- Type-ahead is discarded.  Then Emacs is ready to read another -->
<!-- editing command. -->

     <br><dt>Error Message<dd>An error message is output displayed by Emacs when you ask it to do
something impossible (such as, killing text forward when point is at
the end of the buffer), or when a command malfunctions in some way. 
Such messages appear in the echo area, accompanied by a beep.

     <br><dt>&lt;ESC&gt;<dd>&lt;ESC&gt; is a character used as a prefix for typing Meta characters on
keyboards lacking a &lt;META&gt; key.  Unlike the &lt;META&gt; key (which,
like the &lt;SHIFT&gt; key, is held down while another character is
typed), you press the &lt;ESC&gt; key as you would press a letter key, and
it applies to the next character you type.

     <br><dt>Expression<dd>See <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dBalanced-Expression">Glossary&mdash;Balanced Expression</a>.

     <br><dt>Expunging<dd>Expunging an Rmail, Gnus newsgroup, or Dired buffer is an operation
that truly discards the messages or files you have previously flagged
for deletion.

     <br><dt>Face<dd>A face is a style of displaying characters.  It specifies attributes
such as font family and size, foreground and background colors,
underline and strike-through, background stipple, etc.  Emacs provides
features to associate specific faces with portions of buffer text, in
order to display that text as specified by the face attributes. 
See <a href="#Faces">Faces</a>.

     <br><dt>File Local Variable<dd>A file local variable is a local variable (q.v.) specified in a
given file.  See <a href="#File-Variables">File Variables</a>, and <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dDirectory-Local-Variable">Glossary&mdash;Directory Local Variable</a>.

     <p><a name="Glossary_002d_002d_002dFile-Locking"></a>
<br><dt>File Locking<dd>Emacs uses file locking to notice when two different users
start to edit one file at the same time.  See <a href="#Interlocking">Interlocking</a>.

     <br><dt>File Name<dd><!-- This is fairly tautological... -->
A file name is a name that refers to a file.  File names may be relative
or absolute; the meaning of a relative file name depends on the current
directory, but an absolute file name refers to the same file regardless
of which directory is current.  On GNU and Unix systems, an absolute
file name starts with a slash (the root directory) or with `<samp><span class="samp">~/</span></samp>' or
`<samp><span class="samp">~</span><var>user</var><span class="samp">/</span></samp>' (a home directory).  On MS-Windows/MS-DOS, an
absolute file name can also start with a drive letter and a colon, e.g.,
`<samp><var>d</var><span class="samp">:</span></samp>'.

     <p>Some people use the term &ldquo;pathname&rdquo; for file names, but we do not;
we use the word &ldquo;path&rdquo; only in the term &ldquo;search path&rdquo; (q.v.).

     <br><dt>File-Name Component<dd>A file-name component names a file directly within a particular
directory.  On GNU and Unix systems, a file name is a sequence of
file-name components, separated by slashes.  For example, <samp><span class="file">foo/bar</span></samp>
is a file name containing two components, `<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">bar</span></samp>'; it
refers to the file named `<samp><span class="samp">bar</span></samp>' in the directory named `<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>' in
the current directory.  MS-DOS/MS-Windows file names can also use
backslashes to separate components, as in <samp><span class="file">foo\bar</span></samp>.

     <br><dt>Fill Prefix<dd>The fill prefix is a string that should be expected at the beginning
of each line when filling is done.  It is not regarded as part of the
text to be filled.  See <a href="#Filling">Filling</a>.

     <p><a name="Glossary_002d_002d_002dFilling"></a>
<br><dt>Filling<dd>Filling text means adjusting the position of line-breaks to shift text
between consecutive lines, so that all the lines are approximately the
same length.  See <a href="#Filling">Filling</a>.  Some other editors call this feature
&ldquo;line wrapping&rdquo;.

     <p><a name="Glossary_002d_002d_002dFont-Lock"></a>
<br><dt>Font Lock<dd>Font Lock is a mode that highlights parts of buffer text in different
faces, according to the syntax.  Some other editors refer to this as
&ldquo;syntax highlighting&rdquo;.  For example, all comments (q.v.) 
might be colored red.  See <a href="#Font-Lock">Font Lock</a>.

     <br><dt>Fontset<dd>A fontset is a named collection of fonts.  A fontset specification lists
character sets and which font to use to display each of them.  Fontsets
make it easy to change several fonts at once by specifying the name of a
fontset, rather than changing each font separately.  See <a href="#Fontsets">Fontsets</a>.

     <br><dt>Formfeed Character<dd>See <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dPage">Glossary&mdash;Page</a>.

     <br><dt>Frame<dd>A frame is a rectangular cluster of Emacs windows.  Emacs starts out
with one frame, but you can create more.  You can subdivide each frame
into Emacs windows (q.v.).  When you are using a window system
(q.v.), more than one frame can be visible at the same time. 
See <a href="#Frames">Frames</a>.  Some other editors use the term &ldquo;window&rdquo; for this,
but in Emacs a window means something else.

     <br><dt>Free Software<dd>Free software is software that gives you the freedom to share, study
and modify it.  Emacs is free software, part of the GNU project
(q.v.), and distributed under a copyleft (q.v.) license called the
GNU General Public License.  See <a href="#Copying">Copying</a>.

     <p><a name="Glossary_002d_002d_002dFree-Software-Foundation"></a>
<br><dt>Free Software Foundation<dd>The Free Software Foundation (FSF) is a charitable foundation
dedicated to promoting the development of free software (q.v.). 
For more information, see <a href="http://fsf.org/">the FSF website</a>.

     <br><dt>Fringe<dd>On a graphical display (q.v.), there's a narrow portion of the frame
(q.v.) between the text area and the window's border.  These
&ldquo;fringes&rdquo; are used to display symbols that provide information about
the buffer text (see <a href="#Fringes">Fringes</a>).  Emacs displays the fringe using a
special face (q.v.) called <code>fringe</code>.  See <a href="#Faces">fringe</a>.

     <br><dt>FSF<dd>See <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dFree-Software-Foundation">Glossary&mdash;Free Software Foundation</a>.

     <br><dt>FTP<dd>FTP is an acronym for File Transfer Protocol.  This is one standard
method for retrieving remote files (q.v.).

     <br><dt>Function Key<dd>A function key is a key on the keyboard that sends input but does not
correspond to any character.  See <a href="#Function-Keys">Function Keys</a>.

     <br><dt>Global<dd>Global means &ldquo;independent of the current environment; in effect
throughout Emacs&rdquo;.  It is the opposite of local (q.v.).  Particular
examples of the use of &ldquo;global&rdquo; appear below.

     <br><dt>Global Abbrev<dd>A global definition of an abbrev (q.v.) is effective in all major
modes that do not have local (q.v.) definitions for the same abbrev. 
See <a href="#Abbrevs">Abbrevs</a>.

     <br><dt>Global Keymap<dd>The global keymap (q.v.) contains key bindings that are in effect
everywhere, except when overridden by local key bindings in a major
mode's local keymap (q.v.).  See <a href="#Keymaps">Keymaps</a>.

     <br><dt>Global Mark Ring<dd>The global mark ring records the series of buffers you have recently
set a mark (q.v.) in.  In many cases you can use this to backtrack
through buffers you have been editing, or in which you have found
tags (see <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dTags-Table">Glossary&mdash;Tags Table</a>).  See <a href="#Global-Mark-Ring">Global Mark Ring</a>.

     <p><a name="Glossary_002d_002d_002dGlobal-Substitution"></a>
<br><dt>Global Substitution<dd>Global substitution means replacing each occurrence of one string by
another string throughout a large amount of text.  See <a href="#Replace">Replace</a>.

     <br><dt>Global Variable<dd>The global value of a variable (q.v.) takes effect in all buffers
that do not have their own local (q.v.) values for the variable. 
See <a href="#Variables">Variables</a>.

     <br><dt>GNU<dd>GNU is a recursive acronym for GNU's Not Unix, and it refers to a
Unix-compatible operating system which is free software (q.v.). 
See <a href="#Manifesto">Manifesto</a>.  GNU is normally used with Linux as the kernel since
Linux works better than the GNU kernel.  For more information, see
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/">the GNU website</a>.

     <br><dt>Graphic Character<dd>Graphic characters are those assigned pictorial images rather than
just names.  All the non-Meta (q.v.) characters except for the
Control (q.v.) characters are graphic characters.  These include
letters, digits, punctuation, and spaces; they do not include
&lt;RET&gt; or &lt;ESC&gt;.  In Emacs, typing a graphic character inserts
that character (in ordinary editing modes).  See <a href="#Inserting-Text">Inserting Text</a>.

     <br><dt>Graphical Display<dd>A graphical display is one that can display images and multiple fonts. 
Usually it also has a window system (q.v.).

     <br><dt>Highlighting<dd>Highlighting text means displaying it with a different foreground and/or
background color to make it stand out from the rest of the text in the
buffer.

     <p>Emacs uses highlighting in several ways.  It highlights the region
whenever it is active (see <a href="#Mark">Mark</a>).  Incremental search also
highlights matches (see <a href="#Incremental-Search">Incremental Search</a>).  See <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dFont-Lock">Glossary&mdash;Font Lock</a>.

     <br><dt>Hardcopy<dd>Hardcopy means printed output.  Emacs has various commands for
printing the contents of Emacs buffers.  See <a href="#Printing">Printing</a>.

     <br><dt>&lt;HELP&gt;<dd>&lt;HELP&gt; is the Emacs name for <kbd>C-h</kbd> or &lt;F1&gt;.  You can type
&lt;HELP&gt; at any time to ask what options you have, or to ask what a
command does.  See <a href="#Help">Help</a>.

     <br><dt>Help Echo<dd>Help echo is a short message displayed in the echo area (q.v.) when
the mouse pointer is located on portions of display that require some
explanations.  Emacs displays help echo for menu items, parts of the
mode line, tool-bar buttons, etc.  On graphical displays, the messages
can be displayed as tooltips (q.v.).  See <a href="#Tooltips">Tooltips</a>.

     <br><dt>Home Directory<dd>Your home directory contains your personal files.  On a multi-user GNU
or Unix system, each user has his or her own home directory.  When you
start a new login session, your home directory is the default
directory in which to start.  A standard shorthand for your home
directory is `<samp><span class="samp">~</span></samp>'.  Similarly, `<samp><span class="samp">~</span><var>user</var></samp>' represents the
home directory of some other user.

     <br><dt>Hook<dd>A hook is a list of functions to be called on specific occasions, such
as saving a buffer in a file, major mode activation, etc.  By
customizing the various hooks, you can modify Emacs's behavior without
changing any of its code.  See <a href="#Hooks">Hooks</a>.

     <br><dt>Hyper<dd>Hyper is the name of a modifier bit that a keyboard input character may
have.  To make a character Hyper, type it while holding down the
&lt;Hyper&gt; key.  Such characters are given names that start with
<kbd>Hyper-</kbd> (usually written <kbd>H-</kbd> for short).  See <a href="#User-Input">User Input</a>.

     <br><dt>Iff<dd>&ldquo;Iff&rdquo; means &ldquo;if and only if&rdquo;.  This terminology comes from
mathematics.  Try to avoid using this term in documentation, since
many are unfamiliar with it and mistake it for a typo.

     <br><dt>Inbox<dd>An inbox is a file in which mail is delivered by the operating system. 
Rmail transfers mail from inboxes to Rmail files in which the
mail is then stored permanently or until explicitly deleted. 
See <a href="#Rmail-Inbox">Rmail Inbox</a>.

     <p><a name="Glossary_002d_002d_002dIncremental-Search"></a>
<br><dt>Incremental Search<dd>Emacs provides an incremental search facility, whereby Emacs begins
searching for a string as soon as you type the first character. 
As you type more characters, it refines the search.  See <a href="#Incremental-Search">Incremental Search</a>.

     <br><dt>Indentation<dd>Indentation means blank space at the beginning of a line.  Most
programming languages have conventions for using indentation to
illuminate the structure of the program, and Emacs has special
commands to adjust indentation. 
See <a href="#Indentation">Indentation</a>.

     <br><dt>Indirect Buffer<dd>An indirect buffer is a buffer that shares the text of another buffer,
called its base buffer (q.v.).  See <a href="#Indirect-Buffers">Indirect Buffers</a>.

     <br><dt>Info<dd>Info is the hypertext format used by the GNU project for writing
documentation.

     <br><dt>Input Event<dd>An input event represents, within Emacs, one action taken by the user on
the terminal.  Input events include typing characters, typing function
keys, pressing or releasing mouse buttons, and switching between Emacs
frames.  See <a href="#User-Input">User Input</a>.

     <br><dt>Input Method<dd>An input method is a system for entering non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> text characters by
typing sequences of <acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters (q.v.).  See <a href="#Input-Methods">Input Methods</a>.

     <br><dt>Insertion<dd>Insertion means adding text into the buffer, either from the keyboard
or from some other place in Emacs.

     <br><dt>Interlocking<dd>See <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dFile-Locking">Glossary&mdash;File Locking</a>.

     <br><dt>Isearch<dd>See <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dIncremental-Search">Glossary&mdash;Incremental Search</a>.

     <br><dt>Justification<dd>Justification means adding extra spaces within lines of text in order
to adjust the position of the text edges.  See <a href="#Fill-Commands">Fill Commands</a>.

     <br><dt>Key Binding<dd>See <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dBinding">Glossary&mdash;Binding</a>.

     <br><dt>Keyboard Macro<dd>Keyboard macros are a way of defining new Emacs commands from
sequences of existing ones, with no need to write a Lisp program. 
You can use a macro to record a sequence of commands, then
play them back as many times as you like. 
See <a href="#Keyboard-Macros">Keyboard Macros</a>.

     <p><a name="index-keyboard-shortcuts-5215"></a><br><dt>Keyboard Shortcut<dd>A keyboard shortcut is a key sequence (q.v.) that invokes a
command.  What some programs call &ldquo;assigning a keyboard shortcut&rdquo;,
Emacs calls &ldquo;binding a key sequence&rdquo;.  See <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dBinding">Glossary&mdash;Binding</a>.

     <br><dt>Key Sequence<dd>A key sequence (key, for short) is a sequence of input events (q.v.) 
that are meaningful as a single unit.  If the key sequence is enough to
specify one action, it is a complete key (q.v.); if it is not enough,
it is a prefix key (q.v.).  See <a href="#Keys">Keys</a>.

     <br><dt>Keymap<dd>The keymap is the data structure that records the bindings (q.v.) of
key sequences to the commands that they run.  For example, the global
keymap binds the character <kbd>C-n</kbd> to the command function
<code>next-line</code>.  See <a href="#Keymaps">Keymaps</a>.

     <br><dt>Keyboard Translation Table<dd>The keyboard translation table is an array that translates the character
codes that come from the terminal into the character codes that make up
key sequences.

     <br><dt>Kill Ring<dd>The kill ring is where all text you have killed (see <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dKilling">Glossary&mdash;Killing</a>)
recently is saved.  You can reinsert any of the killed text still in
the ring; this is called yanking (q.v.).  See <a href="#Yanking">Yanking</a>.

     <p><a name="Glossary_002d_002d_002dKilling"></a>
<br><dt>Killing<dd>Killing means erasing text and saving it on the kill ring so it can be
yanked (q.v.) later.  Some other systems call this &ldquo;cutting&rdquo;. 
Most Emacs commands that erase text perform killing, as opposed to
deletion (q.v.).  See <a href="#Killing">Killing</a>.

     <br><dt>Killing a Job<dd>Killing a job (such as, an invocation of Emacs) means making it cease
to exist.  Any data within it, if not saved in a file, is lost. 
See <a href="#Exiting">Exiting</a>.

     <br><dt>Language Environment<dd>Your choice of language environment specifies defaults for the input
method (q.v.) and coding system (q.v.).  See <a href="#Language-Environments">Language Environments</a>.  These defaults are relevant if you edit
non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> text (see <a href="#International">International</a>).

     <!-- TODO?  Not really appropriate for the user manual I think. -->
<!-- Lexical Binding -->
<br><dt>Line Wrapping<dd>See <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dFilling">Glossary&mdash;Filling</a>.

     <br><dt>Lisp<dd>Lisp is a programming language.  Most of Emacs is written in a dialect
of Lisp, called Emacs Lisp, which is extended with special features that
make it especially suitable for text editing tasks.

     <br><dt>List<dd>A list is, approximately, a text string beginning with an open
parenthesis and ending with the matching close parenthesis.  In C mode
and other non-Lisp modes, groupings surrounded by other kinds of matched
delimiters appropriate to the language, such as braces, are also
considered lists.  Emacs has special commands for many operations on
lists.  See <a href="#Moving-by-Parens">Moving by Parens</a>.

     <br><dt>Local<dd>Local means &ldquo;in effect only in a particular context&rdquo;; the relevant
kind of context is a particular function execution, a particular
buffer, or a particular major mode.  It is the opposite of &ldquo;global&rdquo;
(q.v.).  Specific uses of &ldquo;local&rdquo; in Emacs terminology appear below.

     <br><dt>Local Abbrev<dd>A local abbrev definition is effective only if a particular major mode
is selected.  In that major mode, it overrides any global definition
for the same abbrev.  See <a href="#Abbrevs">Abbrevs</a>.

     <br><dt>Local Keymap<dd>A local keymap is used in a particular major mode; the key bindings
(q.v.) in the current local keymap override global bindings of the
same key sequences.  See <a href="#Keymaps">Keymaps</a>.

     <br><dt>Local Variable<dd>A local value of a variable (q.v.) applies to only one buffer. 
See <a href="#Locals">Locals</a>.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-</kbd><dd><kbd>M-</kbd> in the name of a character is an abbreviation for &lt;Meta&gt;,
one of the modifier keys that can accompany any character. 
See <a href="#User-Input">M-</a>.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-C-</kbd><dd><kbd>M-C-</kbd> in the name of a character is an abbreviation for
Control-Meta; it means the same thing as <kbd>C-M-</kbd> (q.v.).

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x</kbd><dd><kbd>M-x</kbd> is the key sequence that is used to call an Emacs command by
name.  This is how you run commands that are not bound to key sequences. 
See <a href="#M_002dx">M-x</a>.

     <p><a name="Glossary_002d_002d_002dMail"></a>
<br><dt>Mail<dd>Mail means messages sent from one user to another through the computer
system, to be read at the recipient's convenience.  Emacs has commands for
composing and sending mail, and for reading and editing the mail you have
received.  See <a href="#Sending-Mail">Sending Mail</a>.  See <a href="#Rmail">Rmail</a>, for one way to read
mail with Emacs.

     <br><dt>Mail Composition Method<dd>A mail composition method is a program runnable within Emacs for editing
and sending a mail message.  Emacs lets you select from several
alternative mail composition methods.  See <a href="#Mail-Methods">Mail Methods</a>.

     <br><dt>Major Mode<dd>The Emacs major modes are a mutually exclusive set of options, each of
which configures Emacs for editing a certain sort of text.  Ideally,
each programming language has its own major mode.  See <a href="#Major-Modes">Major Modes</a>.

     <!-- FIXME: Mention margins for filling? -->
<br><dt>Margin<dd>The space between the usable part of a window (including the
fringe) and the window edge.

     <br><dt>Mark<dd>The mark points to a position in the text.  It specifies one end of the
region (q.v.), point being the other end.  Many commands operate on
all the text from point to the mark.  Each buffer has its own mark. 
See <a href="#Mark">Mark</a>.

     <br><dt>Mark Ring<dd>The mark ring is used to hold several recent previous locations of the
mark, in case you want to move back to them.  Each buffer has its
own mark ring; in addition, there is a single global mark ring (q.v.). 
See <a href="#Mark-Ring">Mark Ring</a>.

     <br><dt>Menu Bar<dd>The menu bar is a line at the top of an Emacs frame.  It contains
words you can click on with the mouse to bring up menus, or you can use
a keyboard interface to navigate it.  See <a href="#Menu-Bars">Menu Bars</a>.

     <br><dt>Message<dd>See <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dMail">Glossary&mdash;Mail</a>.

     <br><dt>Meta<dd>Meta is the name of a modifier bit which you can use in a command
character.  To enter a meta character, you hold down the &lt;Meta&gt;
key while typing the character.  We refer to such characters with
names that start with <kbd>Meta-</kbd> (usually written <kbd>M-</kbd> for
short).  For example, <kbd>M-&lt;</kbd> is typed by holding down &lt;Meta&gt;
and at the same time typing <kbd>&lt;</kbd> (which itself is done, on most
terminals, by holding down &lt;SHIFT&gt; and typing <kbd>,</kbd>). 
See <a href="#User-Input">Meta</a>.

     <p>On some terminals, the &lt;Meta&gt; key is actually labeled &lt;Alt&gt;
or &lt;Edit&gt;.

     <br><dt>Meta Character<dd>A Meta character is one whose character code includes the Meta bit.

     <br><dt>Minibuffer<dd>The minibuffer is the window that appears when necessary inside the
echo area (q.v.), used for reading arguments to commands. 
See <a href="#Minibuffer">Minibuffer</a>.

     <p><a name="Glossary_002d_002d_002dMinibuffer-History"></a>
<br><dt>Minibuffer History<dd>The minibuffer history records the text you have specified in the past
for minibuffer arguments, so you can conveniently use the same text
again.  See <a href="#Minibuffer-History">Minibuffer History</a>.

     <br><dt>Minor Mode<dd>A minor mode is an optional feature of Emacs, which can be switched on
or off independently of all other features.  Each minor mode has a
command to turn it on or off.  Some minor modes are global (q.v.),
and some are local (q.v.).  See <a href="#Minor-Modes">Minor Modes</a>.

     <br><dt>Minor Mode Keymap<dd>A minor mode keymap is a keymap that belongs to a minor mode and is
active when that mode is enabled.  Minor mode keymaps take precedence
over the buffer's local keymap, just as the local keymap takes
precedence over the global keymap.  See <a href="#Keymaps">Keymaps</a>.

     <br><dt>Mode Line<dd>The mode line is the line at the bottom of each window (q.v.), giving
status information on the buffer displayed in that window.  See <a href="#Mode-Line">Mode Line</a>.

     <br><dt>Modified Buffer<dd>A buffer (q.v.) is modified if its text has been changed since the
last time the buffer was saved (or since it was created, if it
has never been saved).  See <a href="#Saving">Saving</a>.

     <br><dt>Moving Text<dd>Moving text means erasing it from one place and inserting it in
another.  The usual way to move text is by killing (q.v.) it and then
yanking (q.v.) it.  See <a href="#Killing">Killing</a>.

     <br><dt>MULE<dd><a name="index-MULE-5216"></a>Prior to Emacs 23, <acronym>MULE</acronym> was the name of a software package
which provided a <dfn>MULtilingual Enhancement</dfn> to Emacs, by adding
support for multiple character sets (q.v.).  <acronym>MULE</acronym> was later
integrated into Emacs, and much of it was replaced when Emacs gained
internal Unicode support in version 23.

     <p>Some parts of Emacs that deal with character set support still use the
<acronym>MULE</acronym> name.  See <a href="#International">International</a>.

     <br><dt>Multibyte Character<dd>A multibyte character is a character that takes up several bytes in a
buffer.  Emacs uses multibyte characters to represent non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> text,
since the number of non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters is much more than 256. 
See <a href="#International-Chars">International Characters</a>.

     <br><dt>Named Mark<dd>A named mark is a register (q.v.), in its role of recording a
location in text so that you can move point to that location. 
See <a href="#Registers">Registers</a>.

     <br><dt>Narrowing<dd>Narrowing means creating a restriction (q.v.) that limits editing in
the current buffer to only a part of the text.  Text outside that part
is inaccessible for editing (or viewing) until the boundaries are
widened again, but it is still there, and saving the file saves it
all.  See <a href="#Narrowing">Narrowing</a>.

     <br><dt>Newline<dd>Control-J characters in the buffer terminate lines of text and are
therefore also called newlines.  See <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dEnd-Of-Line">Glossary&mdash;End Of Line</a>.

     <p><a name="index-nil-5217"></a><a name="index-t-5218"></a><br><dt><code>nil</code><dd><code>nil</code> is a value usually interpreted as a logical &ldquo;false&rdquo;.  Its
opposite is <code>t</code>, interpreted as &ldquo;true&rdquo;.

     <p><a name="Glossary_002d_002d_002dNumeric-Argument"></a>
<br><dt>Numeric Argument<dd>A numeric argument is a number, specified before a command, to change
the effect of the command.  Often the numeric argument serves as a
repeat count.  See <a href="#Arguments">Arguments</a>.

     <br><dt>Overwrite Mode<dd>Overwrite mode is a minor mode.  When it is enabled, ordinary text
characters replace the existing text after point rather than pushing
it to one side.  See <a href="#Minor-Modes">Minor Modes</a>.

     <br><dt>Package<dd>A package is a collection of Lisp code that you download and
automatically install from within Emacs.  Packages provide a
convenient way to add new features.  See <a href="#Packages">Packages</a>.

     <p><a name="Glossary_002d_002d_002dPage"></a>
<br><dt>Page<dd>A page is a unit of text, delimited by formfeed characters (<acronym>ASCII</acronym>
control-L, code 014) at the beginning of a line.  Some Emacs
commands are provided for moving over and operating on pages. 
See <a href="#Pages">Pages</a>.

     <br><dt>Paragraph<dd>Paragraphs are the medium-size unit of human-language text.  There are
special Emacs commands for moving over and operating on paragraphs. 
See <a href="#Paragraphs">Paragraphs</a>.

     <br><dt>Parsing<dd>We say that certain Emacs commands parse words or expressions in the
text being edited.  Really, all they know how to do is find the other
end of a word or expression.

     <br><dt>Point<dd>Point is the place in the buffer at which insertion and deletion
occur.  Point is considered to be between two characters, not at one
character.  The terminal's cursor (q.v.) indicates the location of
point.  See <a href="#Point">Point</a>.

     <br><dt>Prefix Argument<dd>See <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dNumeric-Argument">Glossary&mdash;Numeric Argument</a>.

     <br><dt>Prefix Key<dd>A prefix key is a key sequence (q.v.) whose sole function is to
introduce a set of longer key sequences.  <kbd>C-x</kbd> is an example of
prefix key; any two-character sequence starting with <kbd>C-x</kbd> is
therefore a legitimate key sequence.  See <a href="#Keys">Keys</a>.

     <!-- I don't think this kind of thing needs to be here. -->
<br><dt>Primary Selection<dd>The primary selection is one particular X selection (q.v.); it is the
selection that most X applications use for transferring text to and from
other applications.

     <p>The Emacs kill commands set the primary selection and the yank command
uses the primary selection when appropriate.  See <a href="#Killing">Killing</a>.

     <br><dt>Prompt<dd>A prompt is text used to ask you for input.  Displaying a prompt
is called prompting.  Emacs prompts always appear in the echo area
(q.v.).  One kind of prompting happens when the minibuffer is used to
read an argument (see <a href="#Minibuffer">Minibuffer</a>); the echoing that happens when
you pause in the middle of typing a multi-character key sequence is also
a kind of prompting (see <a href="#Echo-Area">Echo Area</a>).

     <br><dt>Query-Replace<dd>Query-replace is an interactive string replacement feature provided by
Emacs.  See <a href="#Query-Replace">Query Replace</a>.

     <p><a name="Glossary_002d_002d_002dQuitting"></a>
<br><dt>Quitting<dd>Quitting means canceling a partially typed command or a running
command, using <kbd>C-g</kbd> (or <kbd>C-&lt;BREAK&gt;</kbd> on MS-DOS).  See <a href="#Quitting">Quitting</a>.

     <br><dt>Quoting<dd>Quoting means depriving a character of its usual special significance. 
The most common kind of quoting in Emacs is with <kbd>C-q</kbd>.  What
constitutes special significance depends on the context and on
convention.  For example, an ordinary character as an Emacs command
inserts itself; so in this context, a special character is any character
that does not normally insert itself (such as &lt;DEL&gt;, for example),
and quoting it makes it insert itself as if it were not special.  Not
all contexts allow quoting.  See <a href="#Inserting-Text">Quoting</a>.

     <br><dt>Quoting File Names<dd>Quoting a file name turns off the special significance of constructs
such as `<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">~</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>'.  See <a href="#Quoted-File-Names">Quoted File Names</a>.

     <br><dt>Read-Only Buffer<dd>A read-only buffer is one whose text you are not allowed to change. 
Normally Emacs makes buffers read-only when they contain text which
has a special significance to Emacs; for example, Dired buffers. 
Visiting a file that is write-protected also makes a read-only buffer. 
See <a href="#Buffers">Buffers</a>.

     <br><dt>Rectangle<dd>A rectangle consists of the text in a given range of columns on a given
range of lines.  Normally you specify a rectangle by putting point at
one corner and putting the mark at the diagonally opposite corner. 
See <a href="#Rectangles">Rectangles</a>.

     <br><dt>Recursive Editing Level<dd>A recursive editing level is a state in which part of the execution of
a command involves asking you to edit some text.  This text may
or may not be the same as the text to which the command was applied. 
The mode line indicates recursive editing levels with square brackets
(`<samp><span class="samp">[</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>').  See <a href="#Recursive-Edit">Recursive Edit</a>.

     <br><dt>Redisplay<dd>Redisplay is the process of correcting the image on the screen to
correspond to changes that have been made in the text being edited. 
See <a href="#Screen">Redisplay</a>.

     <br><dt>Regexp<dd>See <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dRegular-Expression">Glossary&mdash;Regular Expression</a>.

     <br><dt>Region<dd>The region is the text between point (q.v.) and the mark (q.v.). 
Many commands operate on the text of the region.  See <a href="#Mark">Region</a>.

     <br><dt>Register<dd>Registers are named slots in which text, buffer positions, or
rectangles can be saved for later use.  See <a href="#Registers">Registers</a>.  A related
Emacs feature is bookmarks (q.v.).

     <p><a name="Glossary_002d_002d_002dRegular-Expression"></a>
<br><dt>Regular Expression<dd>A regular expression is a pattern that can match various text strings;
for example, `<samp><span class="samp">a[0-9]+</span></samp>' matches `<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>' followed by one or more
digits.  See <a href="#Regexps">Regexps</a>.

     <br><dt>Remote File<dd>A remote file is a file that is stored on a system other than your own. 
Emacs can access files on other computers provided that they are
connected to the same network as your machine, and (obviously) that
you have a supported method to gain access to those files. 
See <a href="#Remote-Files">Remote Files</a>.

     <br><dt>Repeat Count<dd>See <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dNumeric-Argument">Glossary&mdash;Numeric Argument</a>.

     <br><dt>Replacement<dd>See <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dGlobal-Substitution">Glossary&mdash;Global Substitution</a>.

     <br><dt>Restriction<dd>A buffer's restriction is the amount of text, at the beginning or the
end of the buffer, that is temporarily inaccessible.  Giving a buffer a
nonzero amount of restriction is called narrowing (q.v.); removing
a restriction is called widening (q.v.).  See <a href="#Narrowing">Narrowing</a>.

     <br><dt>&lt;RET&gt;<dd>&lt;RET&gt; is a character that in Emacs runs the command to insert a
newline into the text.  It is also used to terminate most arguments
read in the minibuffer (q.v.).  See <a href="#User-Input">Return</a>.

     <br><dt>Reverting<dd>Reverting means returning to the original state.  Emacs lets you
revert a buffer by re-reading its file from disk.  See <a href="#Reverting">Reverting</a>.

     <!-- Seems too obvious, also there is nothing special about the format -->
<!-- these days. -->
<br><dt>Saving<dd>Saving a buffer means copying its text into the file that was visited
(q.v.) in that buffer.  This is the way text in files actually gets
changed by your Emacs editing.  See <a href="#Saving">Saving</a>.

     <br><dt>Scroll Bar<dd>A scroll bar is a tall thin hollow box that appears at the side of a
window.  You can use mouse commands in the scroll bar to scroll the
window.  The scroll bar feature is supported only under windowing
systems.  See <a href="#Scroll-Bars">Scroll Bars</a>.

     <br><dt>Scrolling<dd>Scrolling means shifting the text in the Emacs window so as to see a
different part of the buffer.  See <a href="#Scrolling">Scrolling</a>.

     <br><dt>Searching<dd>Searching means moving point to the next occurrence of a specified
string or the next match for a specified regular expression. 
See <a href="#Search">Search</a>.

     <br><dt>Search Path<dd>A search path is a list of directory names, to be used for searching for
files for certain purposes.  For example, the variable <code>load-path</code>
holds a search path for finding Lisp library files.  See <a href="#Lisp-Libraries">Lisp Libraries</a>.

     <br><dt>Secondary Selection<dd>The secondary selection is one particular X selection (q.v.); some X
applications can use it for transferring text to and from other
applications.  Emacs has special mouse commands for transferring text
using the secondary selection.  See <a href="#Secondary-Selection">Secondary Selection</a>.

     <br><dt>Selected Frame<dd>The selected frame is the one your input currently operates on. 
See <a href="#Frames">Frames</a>.

     <br><dt>Selected Window<dd>The selected window is the one your input currently operates on. 
See <a href="#Basic-Window">Basic Window</a>.

     <br><dt>Selecting a Buffer<dd>Selecting a buffer means making it the current (q.v.) buffer. 
See <a href="#Select-Buffer">Select Buffer</a>.

     <br><dt>Selection<dd>Windowing systems allow an application program to specify
selections whose values are text.  A program can also read the
selections that other programs have set up.  This is the principal way
of transferring text between window applications.  Emacs has commands to
work with the primary (q.v.) selection and the secondary (q.v.) 
selection, and also with the clipboard (q.v.).

     <br><dt>Self-Documentation<dd>Self-documentation is the feature of Emacs that can tell you what any
command does, or give you a list of all commands related to a topic
you specify.  You ask for self-documentation with the help character,
<kbd>C-h</kbd>.  See <a href="#Help">Help</a>.

     <br><dt>Self-Inserting Character<dd>A character is self-inserting if typing that character inserts that
character in the buffer.  Ordinary printing and whitespace characters
are self-inserting in Emacs, except in certain special major modes.

     <br><dt>Sentences<dd>Emacs has commands for moving by or killing by sentences. 
See <a href="#Sentences">Sentences</a>.

     <p><a name="Glossary_002d_002d_002dServer"></a>
<br><dt>Server<dd>Within Emacs, you can start a &ldquo;server&rdquo; process, which listens for
connections from &ldquo;clients&rdquo;.  This offers a faster alternative to
starting several Emacs instances.  See <a href="#Emacs-Server">Emacs Server</a>, and
<a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dDaemon">Glossary&mdash;Daemon</a>.

     <!-- This is only covered in the lispref, not the user manual. -->
<br><dt>Sexp<dd>A sexp (short for &ldquo;s-expression&rdquo;) is the basic syntactic unit of
Lisp in its textual form: either a list, or Lisp atom.  Sexps are also
the balanced expressions (q.v.) of the Lisp language; this is why
the commands for editing balanced expressions have `<samp><span class="samp">sexp</span></samp>' in their
name.  See <a href="#Expressions">Sexps</a>.

     <br><dt>Simultaneous Editing<dd>Simultaneous editing means two users modifying the same file at once. 
Simultaneous editing, if not detected, can cause one user to lose his
or her work.  Emacs detects all cases of simultaneous editing, and
warns one of the users to investigate. 
See <a href="#Interlocking">Interlocking</a>.

     <br><dt>&lt;SPC&gt;<dd>&lt;SPC&gt; is the space character, which you enter by pressing the
space bar.

     <br><dt>Speedbar<dd>The speedbar is a special tall frame that provides fast access to Emacs
buffers, functions within those buffers, Info nodes, and other
interesting parts of text within Emacs.  See <a href="#Speedbar">Speedbar</a>.

     <br><dt>Spell Checking<dd>Spell checking means checking correctness of the written form of each
one of the words in a text.  Emacs can use various external
spelling-checker programs to check the spelling of parts of a buffer
via a convenient user interface.  See <a href="#Spelling">Spelling</a>.

     <br><dt>String<dd>A string is a kind of Lisp data object that contains a sequence of
characters.  Many Emacs variables are intended to have strings as
values.  The Lisp syntax for a string consists of the characters in the
string with a `<samp><span class="samp">"</span></samp>' before and another `<samp><span class="samp">"</span></samp>' after.  A `<samp><span class="samp">"</span></samp>'
that is part of the string must be written as `<samp><span class="samp">\"</span></samp>' and a `<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>'
that is part of the string must be written as `<samp><span class="samp">\\</span></samp>'.  All other
characters, including newline, can be included just by writing them
inside the string; however, backslash sequences as in C, such as
`<samp><span class="samp">\n</span></samp>' for newline or `<samp><span class="samp">\241</span></samp>' using an octal character code, are
allowed as well.

     <br><dt>String Substitution<dd>See <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dGlobal-Substitution">Glossary&mdash;Global Substitution</a>.

     <br><dt>Syntax Highlighting<dd>See <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dFont-Lock">Glossary&mdash;Font Lock</a>.

     <br><dt>Syntax Table<dd>The syntax table tells Emacs which characters are part of a word,
which characters balance each other like parentheses, etc. 
See <a href="elisp.html#Syntax-Tables">Syntax Tables</a>.

     <br><dt>Super<dd>Super is the name of a modifier bit that a keyboard input character may
have.  To make a character Super, type it while holding down the
&lt;SUPER&gt; key.  Such characters are given names that start with
<kbd>Super-</kbd> (usually written <kbd>s-</kbd> for short).  See <a href="#User-Input">User Input</a>.

     <br><dt>Suspending<dd>Suspending Emacs means stopping it temporarily and returning control
to its parent process, which is usually a shell.  Unlike killing a job
(q.v.), you can later resume the suspended Emacs job without losing
your buffers, unsaved edits, undo history, etc.  See <a href="#Exiting">Exiting</a>.

     <br><dt>&lt;TAB&gt;<dd>&lt;TAB&gt; is the tab character.  In Emacs it is typically used for
indentation or completion.

     <p><a name="Glossary_002d_002d_002dTags-Table"></a>
<br><dt>Tags Table<dd>A tags table is a file that serves as an index to the function
definitions in one or more other files.  See <a href="#Tags-Tables">Tags Tables</a>.

     <br><dt>Termscript File<dd>A termscript file contains a record of all characters sent by Emacs to
the terminal.  It is used for tracking down bugs in Emacs redisplay. 
Emacs does not make a termscript file unless you tell it to. 
See <a href="#Bugs">Bugs</a>.

     <br><dt>Text<dd>&ldquo;Text&rdquo; has two meanings (see <a href="#Text">Text</a>):

          <ul>
<li>Data consisting of a sequence of characters, as opposed to binary
numbers, executable programs, and the like.  The basic contents of an
Emacs buffer (aside from the text properties, q.v.) are always text
in this sense. 
<li>Data consisting of written human language (as opposed to programs),
or following the stylistic conventions of human language. 
</ul>

     <p><a name="Glossary_002d_002d_002dText-Terminal"></a>
<br><dt>Text Terminal<dd>A text terminal, or character terminal, is a display that is limited
to displaying text in character units.  Such a terminal cannot control
individual pixels it displays.  Emacs supports a subset of display
features on text terminals.

     <br><dt>Text Properties<dd>Text properties are annotations recorded for particular characters in
the buffer.  Images in the buffer are recorded as text properties;
they also specify formatting information.  See <a href="#Editing-Format-Info">Editing Format Info</a>.

     <br><dt>Theme<dd>A theme is a set of customizations (q.v.) that give Emacs a
particular appearance or behavior.  For example, you might use a theme
for your favorite set of faces (q.v.).

     <br><dt>Tool Bar<dd>The tool bar is a line (sometimes multiple lines) of icons at the top
of an Emacs frame.  Clicking on one of these icons executes a command. 
You can think of this as a graphical relative of the menu bar (q.v.). 
See <a href="#Tool-Bars">Tool Bars</a>.

     <p><a name="Glossary_002d_002d_002dTooltips"></a>
<br><dt>Tooltips<dd>Tooltips are small windows displaying a help echo (q.v.) text, which
explains parts of the display, lists useful options available via mouse
clicks, etc.  See <a href="#Tooltips">Tooltips</a>.

     <br><dt>Top Level<dd>Top level is the normal state of Emacs, in which you are editing the
text of the file you have visited.  You are at top level whenever you
are not in a recursive editing level (q.v.) or the minibuffer
(q.v.), and not in the middle of a command.  You can get back to top
level by aborting (q.v.) and quitting (q.v.).  See <a href="#Quitting">Quitting</a>.

     <br><dt>Transient Mark Mode<dd>The default behavior of the mark (q.v.) and region (q.v.), in which
setting the mark activates it and highlights the region, is called
Transient Mark mode.  In GNU Emacs 23 and onwards, it is enabled by
default.  See <a href="#Disabled-Transient-Mark">Disabled Transient Mark</a>.

     <br><dt>Transposition<dd>Transposing two units of text means putting each one into the place
formerly occupied by the other.  There are Emacs commands to transpose
two adjacent characters, words, balanced expressions (q.v.) or lines
(see <a href="#Transpose">Transpose</a>).

     <br><dt>Trash Can<dd>See <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dDeletion-of-Files">Glossary&mdash;Deletion of Files</a>.

     <p><a name="Glossary_002d_002d_002dTruncation"></a>
<br><dt>Truncation<dd>Truncating text lines in the display means leaving out any text on a
line that does not fit within the right margin of the window
displaying it.  See <a href="#Continuation-Lines">Truncation</a>, and
<a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dContinuation-Line">Glossary&mdash;Continuation Line</a>.

     <br><dt>TTY<dd>See <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dText-Terminal">Glossary&mdash;Text Terminal</a>.

     <br><dt>Undoing<dd>Undoing means making your previous editing go in reverse, bringing
back the text that existed earlier in the editing session. 
See <a href="#Undo">Undo</a>.

     <br><dt>Unix<dd>Unix is a class of multi-user computer operating systems with a long
history.  There are several implementations today.  The GNU project
(q.v.) aims to develop a complete Unix-like operating system that
is free software (q.v.).

     <br><dt>User Option<dd>A user option is a face (q.v.) or a variable (q.v.) that exists so
that you can customize Emacs by setting it to a new value. 
See <a href="#Easy-Customization">Easy Customization</a>.

     <br><dt>Variable<dd>A variable is an object in Lisp that can store an arbitrary value. 
Emacs uses some variables for internal purposes, and has others (known
as &ldquo;user options&rdquo;; q.v.) just so that you can set their values to
control the behavior of Emacs.  The variables used in Emacs that you
are likely to be interested in are listed in the Variables Index in
this manual (see <a href="#Variable-Index">Variable Index</a>).  See <a href="#Variables">Variables</a>, for
information on variables.

     <br><dt>Version Control<dd>Version control systems keep track of multiple versions of a source file. 
They provide a more powerful alternative to keeping backup files (q.v.). 
See <a href="#Version-Control">Version Control</a>.

     <br><dt>Visiting<dd>Visiting a file means loading its contents into a buffer (q.v.) 
where they can be edited.  See <a href="#Visiting">Visiting</a>.

     <br><dt>Whitespace<dd>Whitespace is any run of consecutive formatting characters (space,
tab, newline, and backspace).

     <br><dt>Widening<dd>Widening is removing any restriction (q.v.) on the current buffer;
it is the opposite of narrowing (q.v.).  See <a href="#Narrowing">Narrowing</a>.

     <br><dt>Window<dd>Emacs divides a frame (q.v.) into one or more windows, each of which
can display the contents of one buffer (q.v.) at any time. 
See <a href="#Screen">Screen</a>, for basic information on how Emacs uses the screen. 
See <a href="#Windows">Windows</a>, for commands to control the use of windows.  Some
other editors use the term &ldquo;window&rdquo; for what we call a &ldquo;frame&rdquo;
(q.v.) in Emacs.

     <br><dt>Window System<dd>A window system is software that operates on a graphical display
(q.v.), to subdivide the screen so that multiple applications can
have their] own windows at the same time.  All modern operating systems
include a window system.

     <br><dt>Word Abbrev<dd>See <a href="#Glossary_002d_002d_002dAbbrev">Glossary&mdash;Abbrev</a>.

     <br><dt>Word Search<dd>Word search is searching for a sequence of words, considering the
punctuation between them as insignificant.  See <a href="#Word-Search">Word Search</a>.

     <p><a name="Glossary_002d_002d_002dYanking"></a>
<br><dt>Yanking<dd>Yanking means reinserting text previously killed (q.v.).  It can be
used to undo a mistaken kill, or for copying or moving text.  Some
other systems call this &ldquo;pasting&rdquo;.  See <a href="#Yanking">Yanking</a>.

their public spirit, we list here in alphabetical order those who have
written substantial portions.  Others too numerous to mention have
reported and fixed bugs, and added features to many parts of Emacs. 
We thank them for their generosity as well.

   <p>This list is intended to mention every contributor of a major package or
feature we currently distribute; if you know of someone we have omitted,
please make a bug report.  More comprehensive information is
available in the <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> files, summarized in the file
<samp><span class="file">etc/AUTHORS</span></samp> in the distribution.

<!-- We should list here anyone who has contributed a new package, -->
<!-- and anyone who has made major enhancements in Emacs -->
<!-- that many users would notice and consider important. -->
<!-- Remove things that are no longer distributed. -->
<!-- Note this file is only used ifnottex; otherwise a shorter version in -->
<!-- emacs.texi is used. -->

<a name="texinfo-footnotes-in-document"></a><h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> This manual is itself
covered by the GNU Free Documentation License.  This license is
similar in spirit to the General Public License, but is more suitable
for documentation.  See <a href="#GNU-Free-Documentation-License">GNU Free Documentation License</a>.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-2" href="#fnd-2">2</a>]</small> The
term &ldquo;point&rdquo; comes from the character `<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>', which was the
command in TECO (the language in which the original Emacs was written)
for accessing the editing position.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-3" href="#fnd-3">3</a>]</small> We refer to &lt;Alt&gt; as &lt;META&gt; for
historical reasons.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-4" href="#fnd-4">4</a>]</small> Setting <code>inhibit-startup-screen</code> in
<samp><span class="file">site-start.el</span></samp> doesn't work, because the startup screen is set
up before reading <samp><span class="file">site-start.el</span></samp>.  See <a href="#Init-File">Init File</a>, for
information about <samp><span class="file">site-start.el</span></samp>.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-5" href="#fnd-5">5</a>]</small> There is no <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>
character in <acronym>ASCII</acronym>; usually, typing <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> on a
text terminal gives the character <kbd>C-@</kbd>.  This key is also bound
to <code>set-mark-command</code>, so unless you are unlucky enough to have
a text terminal that behaves differently, you might as well think of
<kbd>C-@</kbd> as <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-6" href="#fnd-6">6</a>]</small> Aside from <kbd>C-/</kbd>, the <code>undo</code> command is
also bound to <kbd>C-x u</kbd> because that is more straightforward for
beginners to remember: `<samp><span class="samp">u</span></samp>' stands for &ldquo;undo&rdquo;.  It is also bound
to <kbd>C-_</kbd> because typing <kbd>C-/</kbd> on some text terminals actually
enters <kbd>C-_</kbd>.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-7" href="#fnd-7">7</a>]</small> If
your file system does not support symbolic links, a regular file is
used.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-8" href="#fnd-8">8</a>]</small> It is also specified for MIME `<samp><span class="samp">text/*</span></samp>'
bodies and in other network transport contexts.  It is different
from the SGML reference syntax record-start/record-end format, which
Emacs doesn't support directly.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-9" href="#fnd-9">9</a>]</small> If you run Emacs on X, you may need to inform the X
server about the location of the newly installed fonts with commands
such as:
<!-- FIXME?  I feel like this may be out of date. -->
<!-- E.g., the intlfonts tarfile is ~ 10 years old. -->

<pre class="example">      xset fp+ /usr/local/share/emacs/fonts
      xset fp rehash
</pre>
   <p></p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-10" href="#fnd-10">10</a>]</small> It has
been replaced by the `<samp><span class="samp">slides</span></samp>' document class, which comes with
LaTeX.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-11" href="#fnd-11">11</a>]</small> The word &ldquo;sexp&rdquo;
is used to refer to an expression in Lisp.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-12" href="#fnd-12">12</a>]</small> Regular
expressions and syntax tables.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-13" href="#fnd-13">13</a>]</small> 
A <dfn>tag</dfn> is a synonym for identifier reference.  Commands and
features based on the <code>etags</code> package traditionally use &ldquo;tag&rdquo;
with this meaning, and this subsection follows that tradition. 
</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-14" href="#fnd-14">14</a>]</small> The US National Security Agency.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-15" href="#fnd-15">15</a>]</small> 
This capability requires that Emacs be built with <samp><span class="file">libxml2</span></samp>
support or that you have the Lynx browser installed.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-16" href="#fnd-16">16</a>]</small> For PostScript files, GhostScript
is a hard requirement.  For DVI files, <code>dvipdf</code> or <code>dvipdfm</code>
is needed.  For OpenDocument and Microsoft Office documents, the
<code>unoconv</code> tool is needed.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-17" href="#fnd-17">17</a>]</small> The needed
external tools for the document type must be available, and Emacs must
be running in a graphical frame and have PNG image support.  If any of
these requirements is not fulfilled, Emacs falls back to another major
mode.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-18" href="#fnd-18">18</a>]</small> You should not suspend the shell process. 
Suspending a subjob of the shell is a completely different matter&mdash;that
is normal practice, but you must use the shell to continue the subjob;
this command won't do it.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-19" href="#fnd-19">19</a>]</small> Some
programs use a different environment variable; for example, to make
TeX use `<samp><span class="samp">emacsclient</span></samp>', set the <samp><span class="env">TEXEDIT</span></samp> environment
variable to `<samp><span class="samp">emacsclient +%d %s</span></samp>'.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-20" href="#fnd-20">20</a>]</small>  On MS-DOS, the name of this file
should be <samp><span class="file">_dir-locals.el</span></samp>, due to limitations of the DOS
filesystems.  If the filesystem is limited to 8+3 file names, the name
of the file will be truncated by the OS to <samp><span class="file">_dir-loc.el</span></samp>. </p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-21" href="#fnd-21">21</a>]</small> This option has no effect on MS-Windows.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-22" href="#fnd-22">22</a>]</small> Here and below,
whenever we say &ldquo;colon-separated list of directories&rdquo;, it pertains
to Unix and GNU/Linux systems.  On MS-DOS and MS-Windows, the
directories are separated by semi-colons instead, since DOS/Windows
file names might include a colon after a drive letter.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-23" href="#fnd-23">23</a>]</small> 
Older versions of Emacs didn't check the application data directory. 
</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-24" href="#fnd-24">24</a>]</small> 
Some combinations of the &ldquo;Windows&rdquo; keys with other keys are caught
by Windows at a low level in a way that Emacs currently cannot prevent. 
For example, <kbd>&lt;Lwindow&gt; r</kbd> always pops up the Windows
`<samp><span class="samp">Run</span></samp>' dialog.  Customizing the value of
<code>w32-phantom-key-code</code> might help in some cases, though.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-25" href="#fnd-25">25</a>]</small> 
Note that the `<samp><span class="samp">net use</span></samp>' command requires the UNC share name to be
typed with the Windows-style backslashes, while the value of
<code>printer-name</code> can be set with either forward- or backslashes.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-26" href="#fnd-26">26</a>]</small> Normally, one particular codepage is burnt into the
display memory, while other codepages can be installed by modifying
system configuration files, such as <samp><span class="file">CONFIG.SYS</span></samp>, and rebooting. 
While there is third-party software that allows changing the codepage
without rebooting, we describe here how a stock MS-DOS system
behaves.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-27" href="#fnd-27">27</a>]</small> The standard Emacs coding
systems for ISO 8859 are not quite right for the purpose, because
typically the DOS codepage does not match the standard ISO character
codes.  For example, the letter `<samp><span class="samp">&ccedil;</span></samp>' (`<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>' with cedilla) has
code 231 in the standard Latin-1 character set, but the corresponding
DOS codepage 850 uses code 135 for this glyph.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-28" href="#fnd-28">28</a>]</small> The wording here was
careless.  The intention was that nobody would have to pay for
<em>permission</em> to use the GNU system.  But the words don't make this
clear, and people often interpret them as saying that copies of GNU
should always be distributed at little or no charge.  That was never the
intent; later on, the manifesto mentions the possibility of companies
providing the service of distribution for a profit.  Subsequently I have
learned to distinguish carefully between &ldquo;free&rdquo; in the sense of
freedom and &ldquo;free&rdquo; in the sense of price.  Free software is software
that users have the freedom to distribute and change.  Some users may
obtain copies at no charge, while others pay to obtain copies&mdash;and if
the funds help support improving the software, so much the better.  The
important thing is that everyone who has a copy has the freedom to
cooperate with others in using it.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-29" href="#fnd-29">29</a>]</small> This is another place I failed to
distinguish carefully between the two different meanings of &ldquo;free.&rdquo;
The statement as it stands is not false&mdash;you can get copies of GNU
software at no charge, from your friends or over the net.  But it does
suggest the wrong idea.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-30" href="#fnd-30">30</a>]</small> Several such companies now exist.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-31" href="#fnd-31">31</a>]</small> The Free Software
Foundation raises most of its funds from a distribution service,
although it is a charity rather than a company.  If <em>no one</em>
chooses to obtain copies by ordering from the FSF, it will be unable
to do its work.  But this does not mean that proprietary restrictions
are justified to force every user to pay.  If a small fraction of all
the users order copies from the FSF, that is sufficient to keep the FSF
afloat.  So we ask users to choose to support us in this way.  Have you
done your part?</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-32" href="#fnd-32">32</a>]</small> A group of
computer companies recently pooled funds to support maintenance of the
GNU C Compiler.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-33" href="#fnd-33">33</a>]</small> In the 80s I had not yet realized how confusing it was
to speak of &ldquo;the issue&rdquo; of &ldquo;intellectual property.&rdquo;  That term is
obviously biased; more subtle is the fact that it lumps together
various disparate laws which raise very different issues.  Nowadays I
urge people to reject the term &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; entirely,
lest it lead others to suppose that those laws form one coherent
issue.  The way to be clear is to discuss patents, copyrights, and
trademarks separately.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.xhtml">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.xhtml</a> for more
explanation of how this term spreads confusion and bias.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-34" href="#fnd-34">34</a>]</small> Subsequently we have discovered the need to
distinguish between &ldquo;free software&rdquo; and &ldquo;freeware&rdquo;.  The term
&ldquo;freeware&rdquo; means software you are free to redistribute, but usually
you are not free to study and change the source code, so most of it is
not free software.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html</a> for more
explanation.</p>
