<h2 class="unnumbered">Preface</h2>

<p>Most of the GNU Emacs integrated environment is written in the programming
language called Emacs Lisp.  The code written in this programming
language is the software—the sets of instructions—that tell the
computer what to do when you give it commands.  Emacs is designed so
that you can write new code in Emacs Lisp and easily install it as an
extension to the editor.

   </p>
<p>(GNU Emacs is sometimes called an “extensible editor”, but it does
much more than provide editing capabilities.  It is better to refer to
Emacs as an “extensible computing environment”.  However, that
phrase is quite a mouthful.  It is easier to refer to Emacs simply as
an editor.  Moreover, everything you do in Emacs—find the Mayan date
and phases of the moon, simplify polynomials, debug code, manage
files, read letters, write books—all these activities are kinds of
editing in the most general sense of the word.)

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Why Study Emacs Lisp?</h3>

   <p>Although Emacs Lisp is usually thought of in association only with Emacs,
it is a full computer programming language.  You can use Emacs Lisp as
you would any other programming language.

   </p>
<p>Perhaps you want to understand programming; perhaps you want to extend
Emacs; or perhaps you want to become a programmer.  This introduction to
Emacs Lisp is designed to get you started: to guide you in learning the
fundamentals of programming, and more importantly, to show you how you
can teach yourself to go further.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="On-Reading-this-Text"></a></div>

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">On Reading this Text</h3>

<p>All through this document, you will see little sample programs you can
run inside of Emacs.  If you read this document in Info inside of GNU
Emacs, you can run the programs as they appear.  (This is easy to do and
is explained when the examples are presented.)  Alternatively, you can
read this introduction as a printed book while sitting beside a computer
running Emacs.  (This is what I like to do; I like printed books.)  If
you don't have a running Emacs beside you, you can still read this book,
but in this case, it is best to treat it as a novel or as a travel guide
to a country not yet visited: interesting, but not the same as being
there.

   </p>
<p>Much of this introduction is dedicated to walkthroughs or guided tours
of code used in GNU Emacs.  These tours are designed for two purposes:
first, to give you familiarity with real, working code (code you use
every day); and, second, to give you familiarity with the way Emacs
works.  It is interesting to see how a working environment is
implemented. 
Also, I
hope that you will pick up the habit of browsing through source code. 
You can learn from it and mine it for ideas.  Having GNU Emacs is like
having a dragon's cave of treasures.

   </p>
<p>In addition to learning about Emacs as an editor and Emacs Lisp as a
programming language, the examples and guided tours will give you an
opportunity to get acquainted with Emacs as a Lisp programming
environment.  GNU Emacs supports programming and provides tools that
you will want to become comfortable using, such as <kbd>M-.</kbd> (the key
which invokes the <code>find-tag</code> command).  You will also learn about
buffers and other objects that are part of the environment. 
Learning about these features of Emacs is like learning new routes
around your home town.

   </p>
<p>Finally, I hope to convey some of the skills for using Emacs to
learn aspects of programming that you don't know.  You can often use
Emacs to help you understand what puzzles you or to find out how to do
something new.  This self-reliance is not only a pleasure, but an
advantage.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">For Whom This is Written</h3>

<p>This text is written as an elementary introduction for people who are
not programmers.  If you are a programmer, you may not be satisfied with
this primer.  The reason is that you may have become expert at reading
reference manuals and be put off by the way this text is organized.

   </p>
<p>An expert programmer who reviewed this text said to me:

   </p>
<blockquote>
<i>I prefer to learn from reference manuals.  I “dive into” each
paragraph, and “come up for air” between paragraphs.</i>

        <p><i>When I get to the end of a paragraph, I assume that that subject is
done, finished, that I know everything I need (with the
possible exception of the case when the next paragraph starts talking
about it in more detail).  I expect that a well written reference manual
will not have a lot of redundancy, and that it will have excellent
pointers to the (one) place where the information I want is.</i>
</p>
</blockquote>

   <p>This introduction is not written for this person!

   </p>
<p>Firstly, I try to say everything at least three times: first, to
introduce it; second, to show it in context; and third, to show it in a
different context, or to review it.

   </p>
<p>Secondly, I hardly ever put all the information about a subject in one
place, much less in one paragraph.  To my way of thinking, that imposes
too heavy a burden on the reader.  Instead I try to explain only what
you need to know at the time.  (Sometimes I include a little extra
information so you won't be surprised later when the additional
information is formally introduced.)

   </p>
<p>When you read this text, you are not expected to learn everything the
first time.  Frequently, you need make only a nodding
acquaintance with some of the items mentioned.  My hope is that I have
structured the text and given you enough hints that you will be alert to
what is important, and concentrate on it.

   </p>
<p>You will need to dive into some paragraphs; there is no other way
to read them.  But I have tried to keep down the number of such
paragraphs.  This book is intended as an approachable hill, rather than
as a daunting mountain.

   </p>
<p>This introduction to <cite>Programming in Emacs Lisp</cite> has a companion
document,
<a href="elisp.html#Top">The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</a>. 
The reference manual has more detail than this introduction.  In the
reference manual, all the information about one topic is concentrated
in one place.  You should turn to it if you are like the programmer
quoted above.  And, of course, after you have read this
<cite>Introduction</cite>, you will find the <cite>Reference Manual</cite> useful
when you are writing your own programs.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Lisp-History"></a></div>

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Lisp History</h3>

<p><a name="index-Lisp-history-1"></a>
Lisp was first developed in the late 1950s at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology for research in artificial intelligence.  The
great power of the Lisp language makes it superior for other purposes as
well, such as writing editor commands and integrated environments.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-Maclisp-2"></a><a name="index-Common-Lisp-3"></a>GNU Emacs Lisp is largely inspired by Maclisp, which was written at MIT
in the 1960s.  It is somewhat inspired by Common Lisp, which became a
standard in the 1980s.  However, Emacs Lisp is much simpler than Common
Lisp.  (The standard Emacs distribution contains an optional extensions
file, <samp><span class="file">cl.el</span></samp>, that adds many Common Lisp features to Emacs Lisp.)

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Note-for-Novices"></a></div>

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">A Note for Novices</h3>

<p>If you don't know GNU Emacs, you can still read this document
profitably.  However, I recommend you learn Emacs, if only to learn to
move around your computer screen.  You can teach yourself how to use
Emacs with the built-in tutorial.  To use it, type <kbd>C-h t</kbd>.  (This
means you press and release the &lt;CTRL&gt; key and the <kbd>h</kbd> at the
same time, and then press and release <kbd>t</kbd>.)

   </p>
<p>Also, I often refer to one of Emacs's standard commands by listing the
keys which you press to invoke the command and then giving the name of
the command in parentheses, like this: <kbd>M-C-\</kbd>
(<code>indent-region</code>).  What this means is that the
<code>indent-region</code> command is customarily invoked by typing
<kbd>M-C-\</kbd>.  (You can, if you wish, change the keys that are typed to
invoke the command; this is called <dfn>rebinding</dfn>.  See <a href="#Keymaps">Keymaps</a>.)  The abbreviation <kbd>M-C-\</kbd> means that you type your
&lt;META&gt; key, &lt;CTRL&gt; key and &lt;\&gt; key all at the same time. 
(On many modern keyboards the &lt;META&gt; key is labeled
&lt;ALT&gt;.) 
Sometimes a combination like this is called a keychord, since it is
similar to the way you play a chord on a piano.  If your keyboard does
not have a &lt;META&gt; key, the &lt;ESC&gt; key prefix is used in place
of it.  In this case, <kbd>M-C-\</kbd> means that you press and release your
&lt;ESC&gt; key and then type the &lt;CTRL&gt; key and the &lt;\&gt; key at
the same time.  But usually <kbd>M-C-\</kbd> means press the &lt;CTRL&gt; key
along with the key that is labeled &lt;ALT&gt; and, at the same time,
press the &lt;\&gt; key.

   </p>
<p>In addition to typing a lone keychord, you can prefix what you type
with <kbd>C-u</kbd>, which is called the <dfn>universal argument</dfn>.  The
<kbd>C-u</kbd> keychord passes an argument to the subsequent command. 
Thus, to indent a region of plain text by 6 spaces, mark the region,
and then type <kbd>C-u 6 M-C-\</kbd><!-- /@w -->.  (If you do not specify a number,
Emacs either passes the number 4 to the command or otherwise runs the
command differently than it would otherwise.)  See <a href="emacs.html#Arguments">Numeric Arguments</a>.

   </p>
<p>If you are reading this in Info using GNU Emacs, you can read through
this whole document just by pressing the space bar, &lt;SPC&gt;. 
(To learn about Info, type <kbd>C-h i</kbd> and then select Info.)

   </p>
<p>A note on terminology:  when I use the word Lisp alone, I often am
referring to the various dialects of Lisp in general, but when I speak
of Emacs Lisp, I am referring to GNU Emacs Lisp in particular.

<h2 class="chapter">1 List Processing</h2>

<p>To the untutored eye, Lisp is a strange programming language.  In Lisp
code there are parentheses everywhere.  Some people even claim that
the name stands for “Lots of Isolated Silly Parentheses”.  But the
claim is unwarranted.  Lisp stands for LISt Processing, and the
programming language handles <em>lists</em> (and lists of lists) by
putting them between parentheses.  The parentheses mark the boundaries
of the list.  Sometimes a list is preceded by an apostrophe `<samp><span class="samp">'</span></samp>',
called a <dfn>single-quote</dfn> in Lisp.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>  Lists are the basis
of Lisp.

<h3 class="section">1.1 Lisp Lists</h3>

<p><a name="index-Lisp-Lists-4"></a>
In Lisp, a list looks like this: <code>'(rose violet daisy buttercup)</code>. 
This list is preceded by a single apostrophe.  It could just as well be
written as follows, which looks more like the kind of list you are likely
to be familiar with:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     '(rose
       violet
       daisy
       buttercup)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The elements of this list are the names of the four different flowers,
separated from each other by whitespace and surrounded by parentheses,
like flowers in a field with a stone wall around them.

<div class="node"><a name="Numbers-Lists"></a></div>

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Numbers, Lists inside of Lists</h4>

   <p>Lists can also have numbers in them, as in this list: <code>(+ 2 2)</code>. 
This list has a plus-sign, `<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>', followed by two `<samp><span class="samp">2</span></samp>'s, each
separated by whitespace.

   </p>
<p>In Lisp, both data and programs are represented the same way; that is,
they are both lists of words, numbers, or other lists, separated by
whitespace and surrounded by parentheses.  (Since a program looks like
data, one program may easily serve as data for another; this is a very
powerful feature of Lisp.)  (Incidentally, these two parenthetical
remarks are <em>not</em> Lisp lists, because they contain `<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>' and
`<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>' as punctuation marks.)

   </p>
<p>Here is another list, this time with a list inside of it:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     '(this list has (a list inside of it))
</pre>
   <p>The components of this list are the words `<samp><span class="samp">this</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">list</span></samp>',
`<samp><span class="samp">has</span></samp>', and the list `<samp><span class="samp">(a list inside of it)</span></samp>'.  The interior
list is made up of the words `<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">list</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">inside</span></samp>',
`<samp><span class="samp">of</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">it</span></samp>'.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Lisp-Atoms"></a></div>

<h4 class="subsection">1.1.1 Lisp Atoms</h4>

<p><a name="index-Lisp-Atoms-6"></a>
In Lisp, what we have been calling words are called <dfn>atoms</dfn>.  This
term comes from the historical meaning of the word atom, which means
“indivisible”.  As far as Lisp is concerned, the words we have been
using in the lists cannot be divided into any smaller parts and still
mean the same thing as part of a program; likewise with numbers and
single character symbols like `<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>'.  On the other hand, unlike an
ancient atom, a list can be split into parts.  (See <a href="#car-cdr-_0026-cons"><code>car</code> <code>cdr</code> &amp; <code>cons</code> Fundamental Functions</a>.)

   </p>
<p>In a list, atoms are separated from each other by whitespace.  They can be
right next to a parenthesis.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bempty-list_007d-defined-7"></a>Technically speaking, a list in Lisp consists of parentheses surrounding
atoms separated by whitespace or surrounding other lists or surrounding
both atoms and other lists.  A list can have just one atom in it or
have nothing in it at all.  A list with nothing in it looks like this:
<code>()</code>, and is called the <dfn>empty list</dfn>.  Unlike anything else, an
empty list is considered both an atom and a list at the same time.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-Symbolic-expressions_002c-introduced-8"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bexpression_007d-defined-9"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bform_007d-defined-10"></a>The printed representation of both atoms and lists are called
<dfn>symbolic expressions</dfn> or, more concisely, <dfn>s-expressions</dfn>. 
The word <dfn>expression</dfn> by itself can refer to either the printed
representation, or to the atom or list as it is held internally in the
computer.  Often, people use the term <dfn>expression</dfn>
indiscriminately.  (Also, in many texts, the word <dfn>form</dfn> is used
as a synonym for expression.)

   </p>
<p>Incidentally, the atoms that make up our universe were named such when
they were thought to be indivisible; but it has been found that physical
atoms are not indivisible.  Parts can split off an atom or it can
fission into two parts of roughly equal size.  Physical atoms were named
prematurely, before their truer nature was found.  In Lisp, certain
kinds of atom, such as an array, can be separated into parts; but the
mechanism for doing this is different from the mechanism for splitting a
list.  As far as list operations are concerned, the atoms of a list are
unsplittable.

   </p>
<p>As in English, the meanings of the component letters of a Lisp atom
are different from the meaning the letters make as a word.  For
example, the word for the South American sloth, the `<samp><span class="samp">ai</span></samp>', is
completely different from the two words, `<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>', and `<samp><span class="samp">i</span></samp>'.

   </p>
<p>There are many kinds of atom in nature but only a few in Lisp: for
example, <dfn>numbers</dfn>, such as 37, 511, or 1729, and <dfn>symbols</dfn>, such
as `<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>', or `<samp><span class="samp">forward-line</span></samp>'.  The words we have
listed in the examples above are all symbols.  In everyday Lisp
conversation, the word “atom” is not often used, because programmers
usually try to be more specific about what kind of atom they are dealing
with.  Lisp programming is mostly about symbols (and sometimes numbers)
within lists.  (Incidentally, the preceding three word parenthetical
remark is a proper list in Lisp, since it consists of atoms, which in
this case are symbols, separated by whitespace and enclosed by
parentheses, without any non-Lisp punctuation.)

   </p>
<p>Text between double quotation marks—even sentences or
paragraphs—is also an atom.  Here is an example:
<a name="index-Text-between-double-quotation-marks-11"></a>
</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     '(this list includes "text between quotation marks.")
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bstring_007d-defined-12"></a>In Lisp, all of the quoted text including the punctuation mark and the
blank spaces is a single atom.  This kind of atom is called a
<dfn>string</dfn> (for “string of characters”) and is the sort of thing that
is used for messages that a computer can print for a human to read. 
Strings are a different kind of atom than numbers or symbols and are
used differently.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Whitespace-in-Lists"></a></div>

<h4 class="subsection">1.1.2 Whitespace in Lists</h4>

<p><a name="index-Whitespace-in-lists-13"></a>
The amount of whitespace in a list does not matter.  From the point of view
of the Lisp language,

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     '(this list
        looks like this)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">is exactly the same as this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     '(this list looks like this)
</pre>
   <p>Both examples show what to Lisp is the same list, the list made up of
the symbols `<samp><span class="samp">this</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">list</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">looks</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">like</span></samp>', and
`<samp><span class="samp">this</span></samp>' in that order.

   </p>
<p>Extra whitespace and newlines are designed to make a list more readable
by humans.  When Lisp reads the expression, it gets rid of all the extra
whitespace (but it needs to have at least one space between atoms in
order to tell them apart.)

   </p>
<p>Odd as it seems, the examples we have seen cover almost all of what Lisp
lists look like!  Every other list in Lisp looks more or less like one
of these examples, except that the list may be longer and more complex. 
In brief, a list is between parentheses, a string is between quotation
marks, a symbol looks like a word, and a number looks like a number. 
(For certain situations, square brackets, dots and a few other special
characters may be used; however, we will go quite far without them.)

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Typing-Lists"></a></div>

<h4 class="subsection">1.1.3 GNU Emacs Helps You Type Lists</h4>

<p><a name="index-Help-typing-lists-14"></a><a name="index-Formatting-help-15"></a>
When you type a Lisp expression in GNU Emacs using either Lisp
Interaction mode or Emacs Lisp mode, you have available to you several
commands to format the Lisp expression so it is easy to read.  For
example, pressing the &lt;TAB&gt; key automatically indents the line the
cursor is on by the right amount.  A command to properly indent the
code in a region is customarily bound to <kbd>M-C-\</kbd>.  Indentation is
designed so that you can see which elements of a list belong to which
list—elements of a sub-list are indented more than the elements of
the enclosing list.

   </p>
<p>In addition, when you type a closing parenthesis, Emacs momentarily
jumps the cursor back to the matching opening parenthesis, so you can
see which one it is.  This is very useful, since every list you type
in Lisp must have its closing parenthesis match its opening
parenthesis.  (See <a href="emacs.html#Major-Modes">Major Modes</a>, for more information about Emacs's modes.)

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Run-a-Program"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">1.2 Run a Program</h3>

<p><a name="index-Run-a-program-16"></a><a name="index-Program_002c-running-one-17"></a>
<a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bevaluate_007d-defined-18"></a>A list in Lisp—any list—is a program ready to run.  If you run it
(for which the Lisp jargon is <dfn>evaluate</dfn>), the computer will do one
of three things: do nothing except return to you the list itself; send
you an error message; or, treat the first symbol in the list as a
command to do something.  (Usually, of course, it is the last of these
three things that you really want!)

<!-- use code for the single apostrophe, not samp. -->
</p>
<p><a name="index-quote-19"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_0027_007d-for-quoting-20"></a><a name="index-quoting-using-apostrophe-21"></a><a name="index-apostrophe-for-quoting-22"></a>The single apostrophe, <code>'</code>, that I put in front of some of the
example lists in preceding sections is called a <dfn>quote</dfn>; when it
precedes a list, it tells Lisp to do nothing with the list, other than
take it as it is written.  But if there is no quote preceding a list,
the first item of the list is special: it is a command for the computer
to obey.  (In Lisp, these commands are called <em>functions</em>.)  The list
<code>(+ 2 2)</code> shown above did not have a quote in front of it, so Lisp
understands that the <code>+</code> is an instruction to do something with the
rest of the list: add the numbers that follow.

   </p>
<p>If you are reading this inside of GNU Emacs in Info, here is how you can
evaluate such a list:  place your cursor immediately after the right
hand parenthesis of the following list and then type <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (+ 2 2)
</pre>
   <!-- use code for the number four, not samp. -->
<p class="noindent">You will see the number <code>4</code> appear in the echo area.  (What
you have just done is evaluate the list.  The echo area
is the line at the bottom of the screen that displays or echoes
text.)  Now try the same thing with a quoted list:  place the cursor
right after the following list and type <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     '(this is a quoted list)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You will see <code>(this is a quoted list)</code> appear in the echo area.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-Lisp-interpreter_002c-explained-23"></a><a name="index-Interpreter_002c-Lisp_002c-explained-24"></a>In both cases, what you are doing is giving a command to the program
inside of GNU Emacs called the <dfn>Lisp interpreter</dfn>—giving the
interpreter a command to evaluate the expression.  The name of the Lisp
interpreter comes from the word for the task done by a human who comes
up with the meaning of an expression—who interprets it.

   </p>
<p>You can also evaluate an atom that is not part of a list—one that is
not surrounded by parentheses; again, the Lisp interpreter translates
from the humanly readable expression to the language of the computer. 
But before discussing this (see <a href="#Variables">Variables</a>), we will discuss what the
Lisp interpreter does when you make an error.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Making-Errors"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">1.3 Generate an Error Message</h3>

<p><a name="index-Generate-an-error-message-25"></a><a name="index-Error-message-generation-26"></a>
Partly so you won't worry if you do it accidentally, we will now give
a command to the Lisp interpreter that generates an error message. 
This is a harmless activity; and indeed, we will often try to generate
error messages intentionally.  Once you understand the jargon, error
messages can be informative.  Instead of being called “error”
messages, they should be called “help” messages.  They are like
signposts to a traveler in a strange country; deciphering them can be
hard, but once understood, they can point the way.

   </p>
<p>The error message is generated by a built-in GNU Emacs debugger.  We
will enter the debugger.  You get out of the debugger by typing <code>q</code>.

   </p>
<p>What we will do is evaluate a list that is not quoted and does not
have a meaningful command as its first element.  Here is a list almost
exactly the same as the one we just used, but without the single-quote
in front of it.  Position the cursor right after it and type <kbd>C-x
C-e</kbd>:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (this is an unquoted list)
</pre>
   <p>A <samp><span class="file">*Backtrace*</span></samp> window will open up and you should see the
following in it:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ---------- Buffer: *Backtrace* ----------
     Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-function this)
       (this is an unquoted list)
       eval((this is an unquoted list))
       eval-last-sexp-1(nil)
       eval-last-sexp(nil)
       call-interactively(eval-last-sexp)
     ---------- Buffer: *Backtrace* ----------
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Your cursor will be in this window (you may have to wait a few seconds
before it becomes visible).  To quit the debugger and make the
debugger window go away, type:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     q
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Please type <kbd>q</kbd> right now, so you become confident that you can
get out of the debugger.  Then, type <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd> again to re-enter
it.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bfunction_007d-defined-27"></a>Based on what we already know, we can almost read this error message.

   </p>
<p>You read the <samp><span class="file">*Backtrace*</span></samp> buffer from the bottom up; it tells
you what Emacs did.  When you typed <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>, you made an
interactive call to the command <code>eval-last-sexp</code>.  <code>eval</code> is
an abbreviation for “evaluate” and <code>sexp</code> is an abbreviation for
“symbolic expression”.  The command means “evaluate last symbolic
expression”, which is the expression just before your cursor.

   </p>
<p>Each line above tells you what the Lisp interpreter evaluated next. 
The most recent action is at the top.  The buffer is called the
<samp><span class="file">*Backtrace*</span></samp> buffer because it enables you to track Emacs
backwards.

   </p>
<p>At the top of the <samp><span class="file">*Backtrace*</span></samp> buffer, you see the line:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-function this)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The Lisp interpreter tried to evaluate the first atom of the list, the
word `<samp><span class="samp">this</span></samp>'.  It is this action that generated the error message
`<samp><span class="samp">void-function this</span></samp>'.

   </p>
<p>The message contains the words `<samp><span class="samp">void-function</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">this</span></samp>'.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bfunction_007d-defined-28"></a>The word `<samp><span class="samp">function</span></samp>' was mentioned once before.  It is a very
important word.  For our purposes, we can define it by saying that a
<dfn>function</dfn> is a set of instructions to the computer that tell the
computer to do something.

   </p>
<p>Now we can begin to understand the error message: `<samp><span class="samp">void-function
this</span></samp>'.  The function (that is, the word `<samp><span class="samp">this</span></samp>') does not have a
definition of any set of instructions for the computer to carry out.

   </p>
<p>The slightly odd word, `<samp><span class="samp">void-function</span></samp>', is designed to cover the
way Emacs Lisp is implemented, which is that when a symbol does not
have a function definition attached to it, the place that should
contain the instructions is void.

   </p>
<p>On the other hand, since we were able to add 2 plus 2 successfully, by
evaluating <code>(+ 2 2)</code>, we can infer that the symbol <code>+</code> must
have a set of instructions for the computer to obey and those
instructions must be to add the numbers that follow the <code>+</code>.

   </p>
<p>It is possible to prevent Emacs entering the debugger in cases like
this.  We do not explain how to do that here, but we will mention what
the result looks like, because you may encounter a similar situation
if there is a bug in some Emacs code that you are using.  In such
cases, you will see only one line of error message; it will appear in
the echo area and look like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     Symbol's function definition is void: this
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The message goes away as soon as you type a key, even just to
move the cursor.

   </p>
<p>We know the meaning of the word `<samp><span class="samp">Symbol</span></samp>'.  It refers to the first
atom of the list, the word `<samp><span class="samp">this</span></samp>'.  The word `<samp><span class="samp">function</span></samp>'
refers to the instructions that tell the computer what to do. 
(Technically, the symbol tells the computer where to find the
instructions, but this is a complication we can ignore for the
moment.)

   </p>
<p>The error message can be understood: `<samp><span class="samp">Symbol's function
definition is void: this</span></samp>'.  The symbol (that is, the word
`<samp><span class="samp">this</span></samp>') lacks instructions for the computer to carry out.

</p>
<div class="node">
<a name="Names-%26-Definitions"></a><a name="Names-_0026-Definitions"></a>
</div>

<h3 class="section">1.4 Symbol Names and Function Definitions</h3>

<p><a name="index-Symbol-names-29"></a>
We can articulate another characteristic of Lisp based on what we have
discussed so far—an important characteristic: a symbol, like
<code>+</code>, is not itself the set of instructions for the computer to
carry out.  Instead, the symbol is used, perhaps temporarily, as a way
of locating the definition or set of instructions.  What we see is the
name through which the instructions can be found.  Names of people
work the same way.  I can be referred to as `<samp><span class="samp">Bob</span></samp>'; however, I am
not the letters `<samp><span class="samp">B</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">o</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>' but am, or was, the
consciousness consistently associated with a particular life-form. 
The name is not me, but it can be used to refer to me.

   </p>
<p>In Lisp, one set of instructions can be attached to several names. 
For example, the computer instructions for adding numbers can be
linked to the symbol <code>plus</code> as well as to the symbol <code>+</code>
(and are in some dialects of Lisp).  Among humans, I can be referred
to as `<samp><span class="samp">Robert</span></samp>' as well as `<samp><span class="samp">Bob</span></samp>' and by other words as well.

   </p>
<p>On the other hand, a symbol can have only one function definition
attached to it at a time.  Otherwise, the computer would be confused as
to which definition to use.  If this were the case among people, only
one person in the world could be named `<samp><span class="samp">Bob</span></samp>'.  However, the function
definition to which the name refers can be changed readily. 
(See <a href="#Install">Install a Function Definition</a>.)

   </p>
<p>Since Emacs Lisp is large, it is customary to name symbols in a way
that identifies the part of Emacs to which the function belongs. 
Thus, all the names for functions that deal with Texinfo start with
`<samp><span class="samp">texinfo-</span></samp>' and those for functions that deal with reading mail
start with `<samp><span class="samp">rmail-</span></samp>'.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Lisp-Interpreter"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">1.5 The Lisp Interpreter</h3>

<p><a name="index-Lisp-interpreter_002c-what-it-does-30"></a><a name="index-Interpreter_002c-what-it-does-31"></a>
Based on what we have seen, we can now start to figure out what the
Lisp interpreter does when we command it to evaluate a list. 
First, it looks to see whether there is a quote before the list; if
there is, the interpreter just gives us the list.  On the other
hand, if there is no quote, the interpreter looks at the first element
in the list and sees whether it has a function definition.  If it does,
the interpreter carries out the instructions in the function definition. 
Otherwise, the interpreter prints an error message.

   </p>
<p>This is how Lisp works.  Simple.  There are added complications which we
will get to in a minute, but these are the fundamentals.  Of course, to
write Lisp programs, you need to know how to write function definitions
and attach them to names, and how to do this without confusing either
yourself or the computer.

<div class="node"><a name="Complications"></a></div>

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Complications</h4>

   <p>Now, for the first complication.  In addition to lists, the Lisp
interpreter can evaluate a symbol that is not quoted and does not have
parentheses around it.  The Lisp interpreter will attempt to determine
the symbol's value as a <dfn>variable</dfn>.  This situation is described
in the section on variables.  (See <a href="#Variables">Variables</a>.)

   </p>
<p><a name="index-Special-form-32"></a>The second complication occurs because some functions are unusual and
do not work in the usual manner.  Those that don't are called
<dfn>special forms</dfn>.  They are used for special jobs, like defining a
function, and there are not many of them.  In the next few chapters,
you will be introduced to several of the more important special forms.

   </p>
<p>As well as special forms, there are also <dfn>macros</dfn>.  A macro
is a construct defined in Lisp, which differs from a function in that it
translates a Lisp expression into another expression that is to be
evaluated in place of the original expression.  (See <a href="#Lisp-macro">Lisp macro</a>.)

   </p>
<p>For the purposes of this introduction, you do not need to worry too much
about whether something is a special form, macro, or ordinary function. 
For example, <code>if</code> is a special form (see <a href="#if">if</a>), but <code>when</code>
is a macro (see <a href="#Lisp-macro">Lisp macro</a>).  In earlier versions of Emacs,
<code>defun</code> was a special form, but now it is a macro (see <a href="#defun">defun</a>). 
It still behaves in the same way.

   </p>
<p>The final complication is this: if the function that the
Lisp interpreter is looking at is not a special form, and if it is part
of a list, the Lisp interpreter looks to see whether the list has a list
inside of it.  If there is an inner list, the Lisp interpreter first
figures out what it should do with the inside list, and then it works on
the outside list.  If there is yet another list embedded inside the
inner list, it works on that one first, and so on.  It always works on
the innermost list first.  The interpreter works on the innermost list
first, to evaluate the result of that list.  The result may be
used by the enclosing expression.

   </p>
<p>Otherwise, the interpreter works left to right, from one expression to
the next.

<div class="node"><a name="Byte-Compiling"></a></div>

<h4 class="subsection">1.5.1 Byte Compiling</h4>

<p><a name="index-Byte-compiling-33"></a>
One other aspect of interpreting: the Lisp interpreter is able to
interpret two kinds of entity: humanly readable code, on which we will
focus exclusively, and specially processed code, called <dfn>byte
compiled</dfn> code, which is not humanly readable.  Byte compiled code
runs faster than humanly readable code.

   </p>
<p>You can transform humanly readable code into byte compiled code by
running one of the compile commands such as <code>byte-compile-file</code>. 
Byte compiled code is usually stored in a file that ends with a
<samp><span class="file">.elc</span></samp> extension rather than a <samp><span class="file">.el</span></samp> extension.  You will
see both kinds of file in the <samp><span class="file">emacs/lisp</span></samp> directory; the files
to read are those with <samp><span class="file">.el</span></samp> extensions.

   </p>
<p>As a practical matter, for most things you might do to customize or
extend Emacs, you do not need to byte compile; and I will not discuss
the topic here.  See <a href="elisp.html#Byte-Compilation">Byte Compilation</a>, for a full description of byte
compilation.

<div class="node"><a name="Evaluation"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">1.6 Evaluation</h3>

<p><a name="index-Evaluation-34"></a>
When the Lisp interpreter works on an expression, the term for the
activity is called <dfn>evaluation</dfn>.  We say that the interpreter
“evaluates the expression”.  I've used this term several times before. 
The word comes from its use in everyday language, “to ascertain the
value or amount of; to appraise”, according to <cite>Webster's New
Collegiate Dictionary</cite>.

<div class="node"><a name="How-the-Interpreter-Acts"></a></div>

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">How the Lisp Interpreter Acts</h4>

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007breturned-value_007d-explained-35"></a>After evaluating an expression, the Lisp interpreter will most likely
<dfn>return</dfn> the value that the computer produces by carrying out the
instructions it found in the function definition, or perhaps it will
give up on that function and produce an error message.  (The interpreter
may also find itself tossed, so to speak, to a different function or it
may attempt to repeat continually what it is doing for ever and ever in
an infinite loop.  These actions are less common; and
we can ignore them.)  Most frequently, the interpreter returns a value.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bside-effect_007d-defined-36"></a>At the same time the interpreter returns a value, it may do something
else as well, such as move a cursor or copy a file; this other kind of
action is called a <dfn>side effect</dfn>.  Actions that we humans think are
important, such as printing results, are often side effects to the
Lisp interpreter.  It is fairly easy to learn to use side effects.

   </p>
<p>In summary, evaluating a symbolic expression most commonly causes the
Lisp interpreter to return a value and perhaps carry out a side effect;
or else produce an error.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Evaluating-Inner-Lists"></a></div>

<h4 class="subsection">1.6.1 Evaluating Inner Lists</h4>

<p><a name="index-Inner-list-evaluation-37"></a><a name="index-Evaluating-inner-lists-38"></a>
If evaluation applies to a list that is inside another list, the outer
list may use the value returned by the first evaluation as information
when the outer list is evaluated.  This explains why inner expressions
are evaluated first: the values they return are used by the outer
expressions.

   </p>
<p>We can investigate this process by evaluating another addition example. 
Place your cursor after the following expression and type <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (+ 2 (+ 3 3))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The number 8 will appear in the echo area.

   </p>
<p>What happens is that the Lisp interpreter first evaluates the inner
expression, <code>(+ 3 3)</code>, for which the value 6 is returned; then it
evaluates the outer expression as if it were written <code>(+ 2 6)</code>, which
returns the value 8.  Since there are no more enclosing expressions to
evaluate, the interpreter prints that value in the echo area.

   </p>
<p>Now it is easy to understand the name of the command invoked by the
keystrokes <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>: the name is <code>eval-last-sexp</code>.  The
letters <code>sexp</code> are an abbreviation for “symbolic expression”, and
<code>eval</code> is an abbreviation for “evaluate”.  The command
evaluates the last symbolic expression.

   </p>
<p>As an experiment, you can try evaluating the expression by putting the
cursor at the beginning of the next line immediately following the
expression, or inside the expression.

   </p>
<p>Here is another copy of the expression:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (+ 2 (+ 3 3))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If you place the cursor at the beginning of the blank line that
immediately follows the expression and type <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>, you will
still get the value 8 printed in the echo area.  Now try putting the
cursor inside the expression.  If you put it right after the next to
last parenthesis (so it appears to sit on top of the last parenthesis),
you will get a 6 printed in the echo area!  This is because the command
evaluates the expression <code>(+ 3 3)</code>.

   </p>
<p>Now put the cursor immediately after a number.  Type <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd> and
you will get the number itself.  In Lisp, if you evaluate a number, you
get the number itself—this is how numbers differ from symbols.  If you
evaluate a list starting with a symbol like <code>+</code>, you will get a
value returned that is the result of the computer carrying out the
instructions in the function definition attached to that name.  If a
symbol by itself is evaluated, something different happens, as we will
see in the next section.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Variables"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">1.7 Variables</h3>

<p><a name="index-Variables-39"></a>
In Emacs Lisp, a symbol can have a value attached to it just as it can
have a function definition attached to it.  The two are different. 
The function definition is a set of instructions that a computer will
obey.  A value, on the other hand, is something, such as number or a
name, that can vary (which is why such a symbol is called a variable). 
The value of a symbol can be any expression in Lisp, such as a symbol,
number, list, or string.  A symbol that has a value is often called a
<dfn>variable</dfn>.

   </p>
<p>A symbol can have both a function definition and a value attached to
it at the same time.  Or it can have just one or the other. 
The two are separate.  This is somewhat similar
to the way the name Cambridge can refer to the city in Massachusetts
and have some information attached to the name as well, such as
“great programming center”.

   </p>
<p>Another way to think about this is to imagine a symbol as being a chest
of drawers.  The function definition is put in one drawer, the value in
another, and so on.  What is put in the drawer holding the value can be
changed without affecting the contents of the drawer holding the
function definition, and vice versa.

attached to it: in every GNU Emacs buffer, this symbol is set to some
value, usually 72 or 70, but sometimes to some other value.  To find the
value of this symbol, evaluate it by itself.  If you are reading this in
Info inside of GNU Emacs, you can do this by putting the cursor after
the symbol and typing <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     fill-column
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">After I typed <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>, Emacs printed the number 72 in my echo
area.  This is the value for which <code>fill-column</code> is set for me as I
write this.  It may be different for you in your Info buffer.  Notice
that the value returned as a variable is printed in exactly the same way
as the value returned by a function carrying out its instructions.  From
the point of view of the Lisp interpreter, a value returned is a value
returned.  What kind of expression it came from ceases to matter once
the value is known.

   </p>
<p>A symbol can have any value attached to it or, to use the jargon, we can
<dfn>bind</dfn> the variable to a value: to a number, such as 72; to a
string, <code>"such as this"</code>; to a list, such as <code>(spruce pine
oak)</code>; we can even bind a variable to a function definition.

   </p>
<p>A symbol can be bound to a value in several ways.  See <a href="#set-_0026-setq">Setting the Value of a Variable</a>, for information about one way to do
this.

When we evaluated <code>fill-column</code> to find its value as a variable,
we did not place parentheses around the word.  This is because we did
not intend to use it as a function name.

   </p>
<p>If <code>fill-column</code> were the first or only element of a list, the
Lisp interpreter would attempt to find the function definition
attached to it.  But <code>fill-column</code> has no function definition. 
Try evaluating this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (fill-column)

   <p class="noindent">You will create a <samp><span class="file">*Backtrace*</span></samp> buffer that says:

If you attempt to evaluate a symbol that does not have a value bound to
it, you will receive an error message.  You can see this by
experimenting with our 2 plus 2 addition.  In the following expression,
put your cursor right after the <code>+</code>, before the first number 2,
type <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (+ 2 2)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In GNU Emacs 22, you will create a <samp><span class="file">*Backtrace*</span></samp> buffer that
says:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ---------- Buffer: *Backtrace* ----------
     Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-variable +)
       eval(+)
       eval-last-sexp-1(nil)
       eval-last-sexp(nil)

   <p class="noindent">(Again, you can quit the debugger by
typing <kbd>q</kbd> in the <samp><span class="file">*Backtrace*</span></samp> buffer.)

   </p>
<p>This backtrace is different from the very first error message we saw,
which said, `<samp><span class="samp">Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-function this)</span></samp>'. 
In this case, the function does not have a value as a variable; while
in the other error message, the function (the word `<samp><span class="samp">this</span></samp>') did not
have a definition.

   </p>
<p>In this experiment with the <code>+</code>, what we did was cause the Lisp
interpreter to evaluate the <code>+</code> and look for the value of the
variable instead of the function definition.  We did this by placing the
cursor right after the symbol rather than after the parenthesis of the
enclosing list as we did before.  As a consequence, the Lisp interpreter
evaluated the preceding s-expression, which in this case was
<code>+</code> by itself.

   </p>
<p>Since <code>+</code> does not have a value bound to it, just the function
definition, the error message reported that the symbol's value as a
variable was void.

<h3 class="section">1.8 Arguments</h3>

<p><a name="index-Arguments-47"></a><a name="index-Passing-information-to-functions-48"></a>
To see how information is passed to functions, let's look again at
our old standby, the addition of two plus two.  In Lisp, this is written
as follows:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (+ 2 2)
</pre>
   <p>If you evaluate this expression, the number 4 will appear in your echo
area.  What the Lisp interpreter does is add the numbers that follow
the <code>+</code>.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bargument_007d-defined-49"></a>The numbers added by <code>+</code> are called the <dfn>arguments</dfn> of the
function <code>+</code>.  These numbers are the information that is given to
or <dfn>passed</dfn> to the function.

   </p>
<p>The word “argument” comes from the way it is used in mathematics and
does not refer to a disputation between two people; instead it refers to
the information presented to the function, in this case, to the
<code>+</code>.  In Lisp, the arguments to a function are the atoms or lists
that follow the function.  The values returned by the evaluation of
these atoms or lists are passed to the function.  Different functions
require different numbers of arguments; some functions require none at
all.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a>

<h4 class="subsection">1.8.1 Arguments' Data Types</h4>

<p><a name="index-Data-types-50"></a><a name="index-Types-of-data-51"></a><a name="index-Arguments_0027-data-types-52"></a>
The type of data that should be passed to a function depends on what
kind of information it uses.  The arguments to a function such as
<code>+</code> must have values that are numbers, since <code>+</code> adds numbers. 
Other functions use different kinds of data for their arguments.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-concat-53"></a>For example, the <code>concat</code> function links together or unites two or
more strings of text to produce a string.  The arguments are strings. 
Concatenating the two character strings <code>abc</code>, <code>def</code> produces
the single string <code>abcdef</code>.  This can be seen by evaluating the
following:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (concat "abc" "def")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The value produced by evaluating this expression is <code>"abcdef"</code>.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-substring-54"></a>A function such as <code>substring</code> uses both a string and numbers as
arguments.  The function returns a part of the string, a <dfn>substring</dfn> of
the first argument.  This function takes three arguments.  Its first
argument is the string of characters, the second and third arguments
are numbers that indicate the beginning (inclusive) and end
(exclusive) of the substring.  The numbers are a count of the number
of characters (including spaces and punctuation) from the beginning of
the string. Note that the characters in a string are numbered from
zero, not one.

   </p>
<p>For example, if you evaluate the following:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (substring "The quick brown fox jumped." 16 19)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">you will see <code>"fox"</code> appear in the echo area.  The arguments are the
string and the two numbers.

   </p>
<p>Note that the string passed to <code>substring</code> is a single atom even
though it is made up of several words separated by spaces.  Lisp counts
everything between the two quotation marks as part of the string,
including the spaces.  You can think of the <code>substring</code> function as
a kind of atom smasher since it takes an otherwise indivisible atom
and extracts a part.  However, <code>substring</code> is only able to extract
a substring from an argument that is a string, not from another type of
atom such as a number or symbol.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Args-as-Variable-or-List"></a></div>

<h4 class="subsection">1.8.2 An Argument as the Value of a Variable or List</h4>

<p>An argument can be a symbol that returns a value when it is evaluated. 
For example, when the symbol <code>fill-column</code> by itself is evaluated,
it returns a number.  This number can be used in an addition.

   </p>
<p>Position the cursor after the following expression and type <kbd>C-x
C-e</kbd>:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (+ 2 fill-column)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The value will be a number two more than what you get by evaluating
<code>fill-column</code> alone.  For me, this is 74, because my value of
<code>fill-column</code> is 72.

   </p>
<p>As we have just seen, an argument can be a symbol that returns a value
when evaluated.  In addition, an argument can be a list that returns a
value when it is evaluated.  For example, in the following expression,
the arguments to the function <code>concat</code> are the strings
<code>"The "</code><!-- /@w --> and <code>" red foxes."</code><!-- /@w --> and the list
<code>(number-to-string (+ 2 fill-column))</code>.

<!-- For GNU Emacs 22, need number-to-string -->
</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (concat "The " (number-to-string (+ 2 fill-column)) " red foxes.")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If you evaluate this expression—and if, as with my Emacs,
<code>fill-column</code> evaluates to 72—<code>"The 74 red foxes."</code> will
appear in the echo area.  (Note that you must put spaces after the
word `<samp><span class="samp">The</span></samp>' and before the word `<samp><span class="samp">red</span></samp>' so they will appear in
the final string.  The function <code>number-to-string</code> converts the
integer that the addition function returns to a string. 
<code>number-to-string</code> is also known as <code>int-to-string</code>.)

<h4 class="subsection">1.8.3 Variable Number of Arguments</h4>

<p><a name="index-Variable-number-of-arguments-55"></a><a name="index-Arguments_002c-variable-number-of-56"></a>
Some functions, such as <code>concat</code>, <code>+</code> or <code>*</code>, take any
number of arguments.  (The <code>*</code> is the symbol for multiplication.) 
This can be seen by evaluating each of the following expressions in
the usual way.  What you will see in the echo area is printed in this
text after `<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>', which you may read as “evaluates to”.

   </p>
<p>In the first set, the functions have no arguments:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (+)       =&gt; 0
     
     (*)       =&gt; 1
</pre>
   <p>In this set, the functions have one argument each:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (+ 3)     =&gt; 3
     
     (* 3)     =&gt; 3
</pre>
   <p>In this set, the functions have three arguments each:

</p>

<p><a name="index-Wrong-type-of-argument-57"></a><a name="index-Argument_002c-wrong-type-of-58"></a>
When a function is passed an argument of the wrong type, the Lisp
interpreter produces an error message.  For example, the <code>+</code>
function expects the values of its arguments to be numbers.  As an
experiment we can pass it the quoted symbol <code>hello</code> instead of a
number.  Position the cursor after the following expression and type
<kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (+ 2 'hello)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">When you do this you will generate an error message.  What has happened
is that <code>+</code> has tried to add the 2 to the value returned by
<code>'hello</code>, but the value returned by <code>'hello</code> is the symbol
<code>hello</code>, not a number.  Only numbers can be added.  So <code>+</code>
could not carry out its addition.

   </p>
<p>You will create and enter a <samp><span class="file">*Backtrace*</span></samp> buffer that says:

   <p>As usual, the error message tries to be helpful and makes sense after you
learn how to read it.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-3" name="fnd-3"><sup>3</sup></a>

   </p>
<p>The first part of the error message is straightforward; it says
`<samp><span class="samp">wrong type argument</span></samp>'.  Next comes the mysterious jargon word
`<samp><span class="samp">number-or-marker-p</span></samp>'<!-- /@w -->.  This word is trying to tell you what
kind of argument the <code>+</code> expected.

   </p>
<p>The symbol <code>number-or-marker-p</code> says that the Lisp interpreter is
trying to determine whether the information presented it (the value of
the argument) is a number or a marker (a special object representing a
buffer position).  What it does is test to see whether the <code>+</code> is
being given numbers to add.  It also tests to see whether the
argument is something called a marker, which is a specific feature of
Emacs Lisp.  (In Emacs, locations in a buffer are recorded as markers. 
When the mark is set with the <kbd>C-@</kbd> or <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> command,
its position is kept as a marker.  The mark can be considered a
number—the number of characters the location is from the beginning
of the buffer.)  In Emacs Lisp, <code>+</code> can be used to add the
numeric value of marker positions as numbers.

   </p>
<p>The `<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>' of <code>number-or-marker-p</code> is the embodiment of a
practice started in the early days of Lisp programming.  The `<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>'
stands for “predicate”.  In the jargon used by the early Lisp
researchers, a predicate refers to a function to determine whether some
property is true or false.  So the `<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>' tells us that
<code>number-or-marker-p</code> is the name of a function that determines
whether it is true or false that the argument supplied is a number or
a marker.  Other Lisp symbols that end in `<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>' include <code>zerop</code>,
a function that tests whether its argument has the value of zero, and
<code>listp</code>, a function that tests whether its argument is a list.

   </p>
<p>Finally, the last part of the error message is the symbol <code>hello</code>. 
This is the value of the argument that was passed to <code>+</code>.  If the
addition had been passed the correct type of object, the value passed
would have been a number, such as 37, rather than a symbol like
<code>hello</code>.  But then you would not have got the error message.

<h4 class="subsection">1.8.5 The <code>message</code> Function</h4>

<p><a name="index-message-59"></a>
Like <code>+</code>, the <code>message</code> function takes a variable number of
arguments.  It is used to send messages to the user and is so useful
that we will describe it here.

   </p>
<p>A message is printed in the echo area.  For example, you can print a
message in your echo area by evaluating the following list:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (message "This message appears in the echo area!")
</pre>
   <p>The whole string between double quotation marks is a single argument
and is printed <i>in toto</i>.  (Note that in this example, the message
itself will appear in the echo area within double quotes; that is
because you see the value returned by the <code>message</code> function.  In
most uses of <code>message</code> in programs that you write, the text will
be printed in the echo area as a side-effect, without the quotes. 
See <a href="#multiply_002dby_002dseven-in-detail"><code>multiply-by-seven</code> in detail</a>, for an example of this.)

   </p>
<p>However, if there is a `<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>' in the quoted string of characters, the
<code>message</code> function does not print the `<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>' as such, but looks
to the argument that follows the string.  It evaluates the second
argument and prints the value at the location in the string where the
`<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>' is.

   </p>
<p>You can see this by positioning the cursor after the following
expression and typing <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (message "The name of this buffer is: %s." (buffer-name))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In Info, <code>"The name of this buffer is: *info*."</code> will appear in the
echo area.  The function <code>buffer-name</code> returns the name of the
buffer as a string, which the <code>message</code> function inserts in place
of <code>%s</code>.

   </p>
<p>To print a value as an integer, use `<samp><span class="samp">%d</span></samp>' in the same way as
`<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>'.  For example, to print a message in the echo area that
states the value of the <code>fill-column</code>, evaluate the following:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (message "The value of fill-column is %d." fill-column)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">On my system, when I evaluate this list, <code>"The value of
fill-column is 72."</code> appears in my echo area<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-4" name="fnd-4"><sup>4</sup></a>.

   </p>
<p>If there is more than one `<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>' in the quoted string, the value of
the first argument following the quoted string is printed at the
location of the first `<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>' and the value of the second argument is
printed at the location of the second `<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>', and so on.

   </p>
<p>For example, if you evaluate the following,

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (message "There are %d %s in the office!"
              (- fill-column 14) "pink elephants")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">a rather whimsical message will appear in your echo area.  On my system
it says, <code>"There are 58 pink elephants in the office!"</code>.

   </p>
<p>The expression <code>(- fill-column 14)</code> is evaluated and the resulting
number is inserted in place of the `<samp><span class="samp">%d</span></samp>'; and the string in double
quotes, <code>"pink elephants"</code>, is treated as a single argument and
inserted in place of the `<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>'.  (That is to say, a string between
double quotes evaluates to itself, like a number.)

   </p>
<p>Finally, here is a somewhat complex example that not only illustrates
the computation of a number, but also shows how you can use an
expression within an expression to generate the text that is substituted
for `<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>':

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (message "He saw %d %s"
              (- fill-column 32)
              (concat "red "
                      (substring
                       "The quick brown foxes jumped." 16 21)
                      " leaping."))
</pre>
   <p>In this example, <code>message</code> has three arguments: the string,
<code>"He saw %d %s"</code>, the expression, <code>(- fill-column 32)</code>, and
the expression beginning with the function <code>concat</code>.  The value
resulting from the evaluation of <code>(- fill-column 32)</code> is inserted
in place of the `<samp><span class="samp">%d</span></samp>'; and the value returned by the expression
beginning with <code>concat</code> is inserted in place of the `<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>'.

   </p>
<p>When your fill column is 70 and you evaluate the expression, the
message <code>"He saw 38 red foxes leaping."</code> appears in your echo
area.

<a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bbind_007d-defined-62"></a>There are several ways by which a variable can be given a value.  One of
the ways is to use either the function <code>set</code> or the function
<code>setq</code>.  Another way is to use <code>let</code> (see <a href="#let">let</a>).  (The
jargon for this process is to <dfn>bind</dfn> a variable to a value.)

   </p>
<p>The following sections not only describe how <code>set</code> and <code>setq</code>
work but also illustrate how arguments are passed.

<h4 class="subsection">1.9.1 Using <code>set</code>
</h4>

<p><a name="index-set-63"></a>
To set the value of the symbol <code>flowers</code> to the list <code>'(rose
violet daisy buttercup)</code>, evaluate the following expression by
positioning the cursor after the expression and typing <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>.

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (set 'flowers '(rose violet daisy buttercup))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The list <code>(rose violet daisy buttercup)</code> will appear in the echo
area.  This is what is <em>returned</em> by the <code>set</code> function.  As a
side effect, the symbol <code>flowers</code> is bound to the list; that is,
the symbol <code>flowers</code>, which can be viewed as a variable, is given
the list as its value.  (This process, by the way, illustrates how a
side effect to the Lisp interpreter, setting the value, can be the
primary effect that we humans are interested in.  This is because every
Lisp function must return a value if it does not get an error, but it
will only have a side effect if it is designed to have one.)

   </p>
<p>After evaluating the <code>set</code> expression, you can evaluate the symbol
<code>flowers</code> and it will return the value you just set.  Here is the
symbol.  Place your cursor after it and type <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>.

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     flowers
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">When you evaluate <code>flowers</code>, the list
<code>(rose violet daisy buttercup)</code> appears in the echo area.

   </p>
<p>Incidentally, if you evaluate <code>'flowers</code>, the variable with a quote
in front of it, what you will see in the echo area is the symbol itself,
<code>flowers</code>.  Here is the quoted symbol, so you can try this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     'flowers
</pre>
   <p>Note also, that when you use <code>set</code>, you need to quote both
arguments to <code>set</code>, unless you want them evaluated.  Since we do
not want either argument evaluated, neither the variable
<code>flowers</code> nor the list <code>(rose violet daisy buttercup)</code>, both
are quoted.  (When you use <code>set</code> without quoting its first
argument, the first argument is evaluated before anything else is
done.  If you did this and <code>flowers</code> did not have a value
already, you would get an error message that the `<samp><span class="samp">Symbol's value
as variable is void</span></samp>'; on the other hand, if <code>flowers</code> did return
a value after it was evaluated, the <code>set</code> would attempt to set
the value that was returned.  There are situations where this is the
right thing for the function to do; but such situations are rare.)

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Using-setq"></a></div>

<h4 class="subsection">1.9.2 Using <code>setq</code>
</h4>

<p><a name="index-setq-64"></a>
As a practical matter, you almost always quote the first argument to
<code>set</code>.  The combination of <code>set</code> and a quoted first argument
is so common that it has its own name: the special form <code>setq</code>. 
This special form is just like <code>set</code> except that the first argument
is quoted automatically, so you don't need to type the quote mark
yourself.  Also, as an added convenience, <code>setq</code> permits you to set
several different variables to different values, all in one expression.

   </p>
<p>To set the value of the variable <code>carnivores</code> to the list
<code>'(lion tiger leopard)</code> using <code>setq</code>, the following expression
is used:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setq carnivores '(lion tiger leopard))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This is exactly the same as using <code>set</code> except the first argument
is automatically quoted by <code>setq</code>.  (The `<samp><span class="samp">q</span></samp>' in <code>setq</code>
means <code>quote</code>.)

   </p>
<p>With <code>set</code>, the expression would look like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (set 'carnivores '(lion tiger leopard))
</pre>
   <p>Also, <code>setq</code> can be used to assign different values to
different variables.  The first argument is bound to the value
of the second argument, the third argument is bound to the value of the
fourth argument, and so on.  For example, you could use the following to
assign a list of trees to the symbol <code>trees</code> and a list of herbivores
to the symbol <code>herbivores</code>:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setq trees '(pine fir oak maple)
           herbivores '(gazelle antelope zebra))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(The expression could just as well have been on one line, but it might
not have fit on a page; and humans find it easier to read nicely
formatted lists.)

   </p>
<p>Although I have been using the term “assign”, there is another way of
thinking about the workings of <code>set</code> and <code>setq</code>; and that is to
say that <code>set</code> and <code>setq</code> make the symbol <em>point</em> to the
list.  This latter way of thinking is very common and in forthcoming
chapters we shall come upon at least one symbol that has “pointer” as
part of its name.  The name is chosen because the symbol has a value,
specifically a list, attached to it; or, expressed another way,
the symbol is set to point to the list.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Counting"></a></div>

<h4 class="subsection">1.9.3 Counting</h4>

<p><a name="index-Counting-65"></a>
Here is an example that shows how to use <code>setq</code> in a counter.  You
might use this to count how many times a part of your program repeats
itself.  First set a variable to zero; then add one to the number each
time the program repeats itself.  To do this, you need a variable that
serves as a counter, and two expressions: an initial <code>setq</code>
expression that sets the counter variable to zero; and a second
<code>setq</code> expression that increments the counter each time it is
evaluated.

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setq counter 0)                ; <span class="roman">Let's call this the initializer.</span>
     
     (setq counter (+ counter 1))    ; <span class="roman">This is the incrementer.</span>
     
     counter                         ; <span class="roman">This is the counter.</span>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(The text following the `<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>' are comments.  See <a href="#Change-a-defun">Change a Function Definition</a>.)

   </p>
<p>If you evaluate the first of these expressions, the initializer,
<code>(setq counter 0)</code>, and then evaluate the third expression,
<code>counter</code>, the number <code>0</code> will appear in the echo area.  If
you then evaluate the second expression, the incrementer, <code>(setq
counter (+ counter 1))</code>, the counter will get the value 1.  So if you
again evaluate <code>counter</code>, the number <code>1</code> will appear in the
echo area.  Each time you evaluate the second expression, the value of
the counter will be incremented.

   </p>
<p>When you evaluate the incrementer, <code>(setq counter (+ counter 1))</code>,
the Lisp interpreter first evaluates the innermost list; this is the
addition.  In order to evaluate this list, it must evaluate the variable
<code>counter</code> and the number <code>1</code>.  When it evaluates the variable
<code>counter</code>, it receives its current value.  It passes this value and
the number <code>1</code> to the <code>+</code> which adds them together.  The sum
is then returned as the value of the inner list and passed to the
<code>setq</code> which sets the variable <code>counter</code> to this new value. 
Thus, the value of the variable, <code>counter</code>, is changed.

<div class="node"><a name="Summary"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">1.10 Summary</h3>

<p>Learning Lisp is like climbing a hill in which the first part is the
steepest.  You have now climbed the most difficult part; what remains
becomes easier as you progress onwards.

   </p>
<p>In summary,

     </p>
<ul>
<li>Lisp programs are made up of expressions, which are lists or single atoms.

     </li>
<li>Lists are made up of zero or more atoms or inner lists, separated by whitespace and
surrounded by parentheses.  A list can be empty.

     </li>
<li>Atoms are multi-character symbols, like <code>forward-paragraph</code>, single
character symbols like <code>+</code>, strings of characters between double
quotation marks, or numbers.

     </li>
<li>A number evaluates to itself.

     </li>
<li>A string between double quotes also evaluates to itself.

     </li>
<li>When you evaluate a symbol by itself, its value is returned.

     </li>
<li>When you evaluate a list, the Lisp interpreter looks at the first symbol
in the list and then at the function definition bound to that symbol. 
Then the instructions in the function definition are carried out.

     </li>
<li>A single-quote `<samp><span class="samp">'</span></samp>' tells the Lisp interpreter that it should
return the following expression as written, and not evaluate it as it
would if the quote were not there.

     </li>
<li>Arguments are the information passed to a function.  The arguments to a
function are computed by evaluating the rest of the elements of the list
of which the function is the first element.

     </li>
<li>A function always returns a value when it is evaluated (unless it gets
an error); in addition, it may also carry out some action that is a
side effect.  In many cases, a function's primary purpose is to
create a side effect.

<h2 class="chapter">2 Practicing Evaluation</h2>

<p><a name="index-Practicing-evaluation-66"></a><a name="index-Evaluation-practice-67"></a>
Before learning how to write a function definition in Emacs Lisp, it is
useful to spend a little time evaluating various expressions that have
already been written.  These expressions will be lists with the
functions as their first (and often only) element.  Since some of the
functions associated with buffers are both simple and interesting, we
will start with those.  In this section, we will evaluate a few of
these.  In another section, we will study the code of several other
buffer-related functions, to see how they were written.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">How to Evaluate</h3>

   <p><i>Whenever you give an editing command</i> to Emacs Lisp, such as the
command to move the cursor or to scroll the screen, <i>you are evaluating
an expression,</i> the first element of which is a function.  <i>This is
how Emacs works.</i>

   </p>
<p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007binteractive-function_007d-defined-68"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bcommand_007d-defined-69"></a>When you type keys, you cause the Lisp interpreter to evaluate an
expression and that is how you get your results.  Even typing plain text
involves evaluating an Emacs Lisp function, in this case, one that uses
<code>self-insert-command</code>, which simply inserts the character you
typed.  The functions you evaluate by typing keystrokes are called
<dfn>interactive</dfn> functions, or <dfn>commands</dfn>; how you make a function
interactive will be illustrated in the chapter on how to write function
definitions.  See <a href="#Interactive">Making a Function Interactive</a>.

   </p>
<p>In addition to typing keyboard commands, we have seen a second way to
evaluate an expression: by positioning the cursor after a list and
typing <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>.  This is what we will do in the rest of this
section.  There are other ways to evaluate an expression as well; these
will be described as we come to them.

   </p>
<p>Besides being used for practicing evaluation, the functions shown in the
next few sections are important in their own right.  A study of these
functions makes clear the distinction between buffers and files, how to
switch to a buffer, and how to determine a location within it.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Buffer-Names"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">2.1 Buffer Names</h3>

<p><a name="index-buffer_002dname-70"></a><a name="index-buffer_002dfile_002dname-71"></a>
The two functions, <code>buffer-name</code> and <code>buffer-file-name</code>, show
the difference between a file and a buffer.  When you evaluate the
following expression, <code>(buffer-name)</code>, the name of the buffer
appears in the echo area.  When you evaluate <code>(buffer-file-name)</code>,
the name of the file to which the buffer refers appears in the echo
area.  Usually, the name returned by <code>(buffer-name)</code> is the same as
the name of the file to which it refers, and the name returned by
<code>(buffer-file-name)</code> is the full path-name of the file.

   </p>
<p>A file and a buffer are two different entities.  A file is information
recorded permanently in the computer (unless you delete it).  A buffer,
on the other hand, is information inside of Emacs that will vanish at
the end of the editing session (or when you kill the buffer).  Usually,
a buffer contains information that you have copied from a file; we say
the buffer is <dfn>visiting</dfn> that file.  This copy is what you work on
and modify.  Changes to the buffer do not change the file, until you
save the buffer.  When you save the buffer, the buffer is copied to the file
and is thus saved permanently.

   </p>
<p>If you are reading this in Info inside of GNU Emacs, you can evaluate
each of the following expressions by positioning the cursor after it and
typing <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>.

</p>
<pre class="example">     (buffer-name)
     
     (buffer-file-name)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">When I do this in Info, the value returned by evaluating
<code>(buffer-name)</code> is <samp><span class="file">"*info*"</span></samp>, and the value returned by
evaluating <code>(buffer-file-name)</code> is <samp><span class="file">nil</span></samp>.

   </p>
<p>On the other hand, while I am writing this document, the value
returned by evaluating <code>(buffer-name)</code> is
<samp><span class="file">"introduction.texinfo"</span></samp>, and the value returned by evaluating
<code>(buffer-file-name)</code> is
<samp><span class="file">"/gnu/work/intro/introduction.texinfo"</span></samp>.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bnil_007d_002c-history-of-word-72"></a>The former is the name of the buffer and the latter is the name of the
file.  In Info, the buffer name is <samp><span class="file">"*info*"</span></samp>.  Info does not
point to any file, so the result of evaluating
<code>(buffer-file-name)</code> is <samp><span class="file">nil</span></samp>.  The symbol <code>nil</code> is
from the Latin word for “nothing”; in this case, it means that the
buffer is not associated with any file.  (In Lisp, <code>nil</code> is also
used to mean “false” and is a synonym for the empty list, <code>()</code>.)

   </p>
<p>When I am writing, the name of my buffer is
<samp><span class="file">"introduction.texinfo"</span></samp>.  The name of the file to which it
points is <samp><span class="file">"/gnu/work/intro/introduction.texinfo"</span></samp>.

   </p>
<p>(In the expressions, the parentheses tell the Lisp interpreter to
treat <code>buffer-name</code><!-- /@w --> and <code>buffer-file-name</code><!-- /@w --> as
functions; without the parentheses, the interpreter would attempt to
evaluate the symbols as variables.  See <a href="#Variables">Variables</a>.)

   </p>
<p>In spite of the distinction between files and buffers, you will often
find that people refer to a file when they mean a buffer and vice versa. 
Indeed, most people say, “I am editing a file,” rather than saying,
“I am editing a buffer which I will soon save to a file.”  It is
almost always clear from context what people mean.  When dealing with
computer programs, however, it is important to keep the distinction in mind,
since the computer is not as smart as a person.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-Buffer_002c-history-of-word-73"></a>The word “buffer”, by the way, comes from the meaning of the word as a
cushion that deadens the force of a collision.  In early computers, a
buffer cushioned the interaction between files and the computer's
central processing unit.  The drums or tapes that held a file and the
central processing unit were pieces of equipment that were very
different from each other, working at their own speeds, in spurts.  The
buffer made it possible for them to work together effectively. 
Eventually, the buffer grew from being an intermediary, a temporary
holding place, to being the place where work is done.  This
transformation is rather like that of a small seaport that grew into a
great city: once it was merely the place where cargo was warehoused
temporarily before being loaded onto ships; then it became a business
and cultural center in its own right.

   </p>
<p>Not all buffers are associated with files.  For example, a
<samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer does not visit any file.  Similarly, a
<samp><span class="file">*Help*</span></samp> buffer is not associated with any file.

   </p>
<p>In the old days, when you lacked a <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> file and started an
Emacs session by typing the command <code>emacs</code> alone, without naming
any files, Emacs started with the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer visible. 
Nowadays, you will see a splash screen.  You can follow one of the
commands suggested on the splash screen, visit a file, or press the
spacebar to reach the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer.

   </p>
<p>If you switch to the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer, type
<code>(buffer-name)</code>, position the cursor after it, and then type
<kbd>C-x C-e</kbd> to evaluate the expression.  The name <code>"*scratch*"</code>
will be returned and will appear in the echo area.  <code>"*scratch*"</code>
is the name of the buffer.  When you type <code>(buffer-file-name)</code> in
the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer and evaluate that, <code>nil</code> will appear
in the echo area, just as it does when you evaluate
<code>(buffer-file-name)</code> in Info.

   </p>
<p>Incidentally, if you are in the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer and want the
value returned by an expression to appear in the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp>
buffer itself rather than in the echo area, type <kbd>C-u C-x C-e</kbd>
instead of <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>.  This causes the value returned to appear
after the expression.  The buffer will look like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (buffer-name)"*scratch*"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You cannot do this in Info since Info is read-only and it will not allow
you to change the contents of the buffer.  But you can do this in any
buffer you can edit; and when you write code or documentation (such as
this book), this feature is very useful.

<h3 class="section">2.2 Getting Buffers</h3>

<p><a name="index-current_002dbuffer-74"></a><a name="index-other_002dbuffer-75"></a><a name="index-Getting-a-buffer-76"></a>
The <code>buffer-name</code> function returns the <em>name</em> of the buffer;
to get the buffer <em>itself</em>, a different function is needed: the
<code>current-buffer</code> function.  If you use this function in code, what
you get is the buffer itself.

   </p>
<p>A name and the object or entity to which the name refers are different
from each other.  You are not your name.  You are a person to whom
others refer by name.  If you ask to speak to George and someone hands you
a card with the letters `<samp><span class="samp">G</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">e</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">o</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">r</span></samp>',
`<samp><span class="samp">g</span></samp>', and `<samp><span class="samp">e</span></samp>' written on it, you might be amused, but you would
not be satisfied.  You do not want to speak to the name, but to the
person to whom the name refers.  A buffer is similar: the name of the
scratch buffer is <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp>, but the name is not the buffer.  To
get a buffer itself, you need to use a function such as
<code>current-buffer</code>.

   </p>
<p>However, there is a slight complication: if you evaluate
<code>current-buffer</code> in an expression on its own, as we will do here,
what you see is a printed representation of the name of the buffer
without the contents of the buffer.  Emacs works this way for two
reasons: the buffer may be thousands of lines long—too long to be
conveniently displayed; and, another buffer may have the same contents
but a different name, and it is important to distinguish between them.

   </p>
<p>Here is an expression containing the function:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (current-buffer)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If you evaluate this expression in Info in Emacs in the usual way,
<samp><span class="file">#&lt;buffer *info*&gt;</span></samp> will appear in the echo area.  The special
format indicates that the buffer itself is being returned, rather than
just its name.

   </p>
<p>Incidentally, while you can type a number or symbol into a program, you
cannot do that with the printed representation of a buffer: the only way
to get a buffer itself is with a function such as <code>current-buffer</code>.

   </p>
<p>A related function is <code>other-buffer</code>.  This returns the most
recently selected buffer other than the one you are in currently, not
a printed representation of its name.  If you have recently switched
back and forth from the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer, <code>other-buffer</code>
will return that buffer.

   </p>
<p>You can see this by evaluating the expression:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (other-buffer)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You should see <samp><span class="file">#&lt;buffer *scratch*&gt;</span></samp> appear in the echo area, or
the name of whatever other buffer you switched back from most
recently<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-5" name="fnd-5"><sup>5</sup></a>.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Switching-Buffers"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">2.3 Switching Buffers</h3>

<p><a name="index-switch_002dto_002dbuffer-77"></a><a name="index-set_002dbuffer-78"></a><a name="index-Switching-to-a-buffer-79"></a>
The <code>other-buffer</code> function actually provides a buffer when it is
used as an argument to a function that requires one.  We can see this
by using <code>other-buffer</code> and <code>switch-to-buffer</code> to switch to a
different buffer.

   </p>
<p>But first, a brief introduction to the <code>switch-to-buffer</code>
function.  When you switched back and forth from Info to the
<samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer to evaluate <code>(buffer-name)</code>, you most
likely typed <kbd>C-x b</kbd> and then typed <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-6" name="fnd-6"><sup>6</sup></a> when prompted in the minibuffer for the name of
the buffer to which you wanted to switch.  The keystrokes, <kbd>C-x
b</kbd>, cause the Lisp interpreter to evaluate the interactive function
<code>switch-to-buffer</code>.  As we said before, this is how Emacs works:
different keystrokes call or run different functions.  For example,
<kbd>C-f</kbd> calls <code>forward-char</code>, <kbd>M-e</kbd> calls
<code>forward-sentence</code>, and so on.

   </p>
<p>By writing <code>switch-to-buffer</code> in an expression, and giving it a
buffer to switch to, we can switch buffers just the way <kbd>C-x b</kbd>
does:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (switch-to-buffer (other-buffer))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The symbol <code>switch-to-buffer</code> is the first element of the list,
so the Lisp interpreter will treat it as a function and carry out the
instructions that are attached to it.  But before doing that, the
interpreter will note that <code>other-buffer</code> is inside parentheses
and work on that symbol first.  <code>other-buffer</code> is the first (and
in this case, the only) element of this list, so the Lisp interpreter
calls or runs the function.  It returns another buffer.  Next, the
interpreter runs <code>switch-to-buffer</code>, passing to it, as an
argument, the other buffer, which is what Emacs will switch to.  If
you are reading this in Info, try this now.  Evaluate the expression. 
(To get back, type <kbd>C-x b &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.)<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-7" name="fnd-7"><sup>7</sup></a>

   </p>
<p>In the programming examples in later sections of this document, you will
see the function <code>set-buffer</code> more often than
<code>switch-to-buffer</code>.  This is because of a difference between
computer programs and humans: humans have eyes and expect to see the
buffer on which they are working on their computer terminals.  This is
so obvious, it almost goes without saying.  However, programs do not
have eyes.  When a computer program works on a buffer, that buffer does
not need to be visible on the screen.

   </p>
<p><code>switch-to-buffer</code> is designed for humans and does two different
things: it switches the buffer to which Emacs's attention is directed; and
it switches the buffer displayed in the window to the new buffer. 
<code>set-buffer</code>, on the other hand, does only one thing: it switches
the attention of the computer program to a different buffer.  The buffer
on the screen remains unchanged (of course, normally nothing happens
there until the command finishes running).

   </p>
<p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bcall_007d-defined-80"></a>Also, we have just introduced another jargon term, the word <dfn>call</dfn>. 
When you evaluate a list in which the first symbol is a function, you
are calling that function.  The use of the term comes from the notion of
the function as an entity that can do something for you if you call
it—just as a plumber is an entity who can fix a leak if you call him
or her.

<p><a name="index-Size-of-buffer-81"></a><a name="index-Buffer-size-82"></a><a name="index-Point-location-83"></a><a name="index-Location-of-point-84"></a>
Finally, let's look at several rather simple functions,
<code>buffer-size</code>, <code>point</code>, <code>point-min</code>, and
<code>point-max</code>.  These give information about the size of a buffer and
the location of point within it.

   </p>
<p>The function <code>buffer-size</code> tells you the size of the current
buffer; that is, the function returns a count of the number of
characters in the buffer.

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (buffer-size)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You can evaluate this in the usual way, by positioning the
cursor after the expression and typing <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bpoint_007d-defined-85"></a>In Emacs, the current  position of the cursor is called <dfn>point</dfn>. 
The expression <code>(point)</code> returns a number that tells you where the
cursor is located as a count of the number of characters from the
beginning of the buffer up to point.

   </p>
<p>You can see the character count for point in this buffer by evaluating
the following expression in the usual way:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (point)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">As I write this, the value of point is 65724.  The <code>point</code>
function is frequently used in some of the examples later in this
book.

   </p>
<p>The value of point depends, of course, on its location within the
buffer.  If you evaluate point in this spot, the number will be larger:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (point)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">For me, the value of point in this location is 66043, which means that
there are 319 characters (including spaces) between the two
expressions.  (Doubtless, you will see different numbers, since I will
have edited this since I first evaluated point.)

   </p>
<p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bnarrowing_007d-defined-86"></a>The function <code>point-min</code> is somewhat similar to <code>point</code>, but
it returns the value of the minimum permissible value of point in the
current buffer.  This is the number 1 unless <dfn>narrowing</dfn> is in
effect.  (Narrowing is a mechanism whereby you can restrict yourself,
or a program, to operations on just a part of a buffer. 
See <a href="#Narrowing-_0026-Widening">Narrowing and Widening</a>.)  Likewise, the
function <code>point-max</code> returns the value of the maximum permissible
value of point in the current buffer.

<p><a name="index-Definition-writing-87"></a><a name="index-Function-definition-writing-88"></a><a name="index-Writing-a-function-definition-89"></a>
When the Lisp interpreter evaluates a list, it looks to see whether the
first symbol on the list has a function definition attached to it; or,
put another way, whether the symbol points to a function definition.  If
it does, the computer carries out the instructions in the definition.  A
symbol that has a function definition is called, simply, a function
(although, properly speaking, the definition is the function and the
symbol refers to it.)

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">An Aside about Primitive Functions</h3>

   <p><a name="index-Primitive-functions-90"></a><a name="index-Functions_002c-primitive-91"></a>
<a name="index-C-language-primitives-92"></a><a name="index-Primitives-written-in-C-93"></a>All functions are defined in terms of other functions, except for a few
<dfn>primitive</dfn> functions that are written in the C programming
language.  When you write functions' definitions, you will write them in
Emacs Lisp and use other functions as your building blocks.  Some of the
functions you will use will themselves be written in Emacs Lisp (perhaps
by you) and some will be primitives written in C.  The primitive
functions are used exactly like those written in Emacs Lisp and behave
like them.  They are written in C so we can easily run GNU Emacs on any
computer that has sufficient power and can run C.

   </p>
<p>Let me re-emphasize this: when you write code in Emacs Lisp, you do not
distinguish between the use of functions written in C and the use of
functions written in Emacs Lisp.  The difference is irrelevant.  I
mention the distinction only because it is interesting to know.  Indeed,
unless you investigate, you won't know whether an already-written
function is written in Emacs Lisp or C.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="defun"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">3.1 The <code>defun</code> Macro</h3>

<p><a name="index-defun-94"></a>
<a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bfunction-definition_007d-defined-95"></a>In Lisp, a symbol such as <code>mark-whole-buffer</code> has code attached to
it that tells the computer what to do when the function is called. 
This code is called the <dfn>function definition</dfn> and is created by
evaluating a Lisp expression that starts with the symbol <code>defun</code>
(which is an abbreviation for <em>define function</em>).

   </p>
<p>In subsequent sections, we will look at function definitions from the
Emacs source code, such as <code>mark-whole-buffer</code>.  In this section,
we will describe a simple function definition so you can see how it
looks.  This function definition uses arithmetic because it makes for a
simple example.  Some people dislike examples using arithmetic; however,
if you are such a person, do not despair.  Hardly any of the code we
will study in the remainder of this introduction involves arithmetic or
mathematics.  The examples mostly involve text in one way or another.

   </p>
<p>A function definition has up to five parts following the word
<code>defun</code>:

     </p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>The name of the symbol to which the function definition should be
attached.

     </li>
<li>A list of the arguments that will be passed to the function.  If no
arguments will be passed to the function, this is an empty list,
<code>()</code>.

     </li>
<li>Documentation describing the function.  (Technically optional, but
strongly recommended.)

     </li>
<li>Optionally, an expression to make the function interactive so you can
use it by typing <kbd>M-x</kbd> and then the name of the function; or by
typing an appropriate key or keychord.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bbody_007d-defined-96"></a></p>
</li>
<li>The code that instructs the computer what to do: the <dfn>body</dfn> of the
function definition.
        </li>
</ol>

   <p>It is helpful to think of the five parts of a function definition as
being organized in a template, with slots for each part:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun <var>function-name</var> (<var>arguments</var>...)
       "<var>optional-documentation</var>..."
       (interactive <var>argument-passing-info</var>)     ; <span class="roman">optional</span>
       <var>body</var>...)
</pre>
   <p>As an example, here is the code for a function that multiplies its
argument by 7.  (This example is not interactive.  See <a href="#Interactive">Making a Function Interactive</a>, for that information.)

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun multiply-by-seven (number)
       "Multiply NUMBER by seven."
       (* 7 number))
</pre>
   <p>This definition begins with a parenthesis and the symbol <code>defun</code>,
followed by the name of the function.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bargument-list_007d-defined-97"></a>The name of the function is followed by a list that contains the
arguments that will be passed to the function.  This list is called
the <dfn>argument list</dfn>.  In this example, the list has only one
element, the symbol, <code>number</code>.  When the function is used, the
symbol will be bound to the value that is used as the argument to the
function.

   </p>
<p>Instead of choosing the word <code>number</code> for the name of the argument,
I could have picked any other name.  For example, I could have chosen
the word <code>multiplicand</code>.  I picked the word “number” because it
tells what kind of value is intended for this slot; but I could just as
well have chosen the word “multiplicand” to indicate the role that the
value placed in this slot will play in the workings of the function.  I
could have called it <code>foogle</code>, but that would have been a bad
choice because it would not tell humans what it means.  The choice of
name is up to the programmer and should be chosen to make the meaning of
the function clear.

   </p>
<p>Indeed, you can choose any name you wish for a symbol in an argument
list, even the name of a symbol used in some other function: the name
you use in an argument list is private to that particular definition. 
In that definition, the name refers to a different entity than any use
of the same name outside the function definition.  Suppose you have a
nick-name “Shorty” in your family; when your family members refer to
“Shorty”, they mean you.  But outside your family, in a movie, for
example, the name “Shorty” refers to someone else.  Because a name in an
argument list is private to the function definition, you can change the
value of such a symbol inside the body of a function without changing
its value outside the function.  The effect is similar to that produced
by a <code>let</code> expression.  (See <a href="#let"><code>let</code></a>.)

   </p>
<p>The argument list is followed by the documentation string that
describes the function.  This is what you see when you type
<kbd>C-h f</kbd><!-- /@w --> and the name of a function.  Incidentally, when you
write a documentation string like this, you should make the first line
a complete sentence since some commands, such as <code>apropos</code>, print
only the first line of a multi-line documentation string.  Also, you
should not indent the second line of a documentation string, if you
have one, because that looks odd when you use <kbd>C-h f</kbd>
(<code>describe-function</code>).  The documentation string is optional, but
it is so useful, it should be included in almost every function you
write.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-g_t_002a-_0040r_007b_0028multiplication_0029_007d-98"></a>The third line of the example consists of the body of the function
definition.  (Most functions' definitions, of course, are longer than
this.)  In this function, the body is the list, <code>(* 7 number)</code>, which
says to multiply the value of <var>number</var> by 7.  (In Emacs Lisp,
<code>*</code> is the function for multiplication, just as <code>+</code> is the
function for addition.)

   </p>
<p>When you use the <code>multiply-by-seven</code> function, the argument
<code>number</code> evaluates to the actual number you want used.  Here is an
example that shows how <code>multiply-by-seven</code> is used; but don't try
to evaluate this yet!

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (multiply-by-seven 3)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The symbol <code>number</code>, specified in the function definition in the
next section, is bound to the value 3 in the actual use of
the function.  Note that although <code>number</code> was inside parentheses
in the function definition, the argument passed to the
<code>multiply-by-seven</code> function is not in parentheses.  The
parentheses are written in the function definition so the computer can
figure out where the argument list ends and the rest of the function
definition begins.

   </p>
<p>If you evaluate this example, you are likely to get an error message. 
(Go ahead, try it!)  This is because we have written the function
definition, but not yet told the computer about the definition—we have
not yet loaded the function definition in Emacs. 
Installing a function is the process that tells the Lisp interpreter the
definition of the function.  Installation is described in the next
section.

definition and then evaluating <code>(multiply-by-seven 3)</code>.  A copy of
the function definition follows.  Place the cursor after the last
parenthesis of the function definition and type <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>.  When you
do this, <code>multiply-by-seven</code> will appear in the echo area.  (What
this means is that when a function definition is evaluated, the value it
returns is the name of the defined function.)  At the same time, this
action installs the function definition.

If you want to change the code in <code>multiply-by-seven</code>, just rewrite
it.  To install the new version in place of the old one, evaluate the
function definition again.  This is how you modify code in Emacs.  It is
very simple.

   </p>
<p>As an example, you can change the <code>multiply-by-seven</code> function to
add the number to itself seven times instead of multiplying the number
by seven.  It produces the same answer, but by a different path.  At
the same time, we will add a comment to the code; a comment is text
that the Lisp interpreter ignores, but that a human reader may find
useful or enlightening.  The comment is that this is the second
version.

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun multiply-by-seven (number)       ; <span class="roman">Second version.</span>
       "Multiply NUMBER by seven."
       (+ number number number number number number number))
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-Comments-in-Lisp-code-105"></a>The comment follows a semicolon, `<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>'.  In Lisp, everything on a
line that follows a semicolon is a comment.  The end of the line is the
end of the comment.  To stretch a comment over two or more lines, begin
each line with a semicolon.

   </p>
<p>See <a href="#Beginning-init-File">Beginning a <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> File</a>, and <a href="elisp.html#Comments">Comments</a>, for more about comments.

   </p>
<p>You can install this version of the <code>multiply-by-seven</code> function by
evaluating it in the same way you evaluated the first function: place
the cursor after the last parenthesis and type <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>.

   </p>
<p>In summary, this is how you write code in Emacs Lisp: you write a
function; install it; test it; and then make fixes or enhancements and
install it again.

<h3 class="section">3.3 Make a Function Interactive</h3>

<p><a name="index-Interactive-functions-106"></a><a name="index-interactive-107"></a>
You make a function interactive by placing a list that begins with
the special form <code>interactive</code> immediately after the
documentation.  A user can invoke an interactive function by typing
<kbd>M-x</kbd> and then the name of the function; or by typing the keys to
which it is bound, for example, by typing <kbd>C-n</kbd> for
<code>next-line</code> or <kbd>C-x h</kbd> for <code>mark-whole-buffer</code>.

   </p>
<p>Interestingly, when you call an interactive function interactively,
the value returned is not automatically displayed in the echo area. 
This is because you often call an interactive function for its side
effects, such as moving forward by a word or line, and not for the
value returned.  If the returned value were displayed in the echo area
each time you typed a key, it would be very distracting.

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">An Interactive <code>multiply-by-seven</code>, An Overview</h4>

   <p>Both the use of the special form <code>interactive</code> and one way to
display a value in the echo area can be illustrated by creating an
interactive version of <code>multiply-by-seven</code>.

   </p>
<p>Here is the code:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun multiply-by-seven (number)       ; <span class="roman">Interactive version.</span>
       "Multiply NUMBER by seven."
       (interactive "p")
       (message "The result is %d" (* 7 number)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You can install this code by placing your cursor after it and typing
<kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>.  The name of the function will appear in your echo area. 
Then, you can use this code by typing <kbd>C-u</kbd> and a number and then
typing <kbd>M-x multiply-by-seven</kbd> and pressing &lt;RET&gt;.  The phrase
`<samp><span class="samp">The result is ...</span></samp>' followed by the product will appear in the
echo area.

   </p>
<p>Speaking more generally, you invoke a function like this in either of two
ways:

     </p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>By typing a prefix argument that contains the number to be passed, and
then typing <kbd>M-x</kbd> and the name of the function, as with
<kbd>C-u 3 M-x forward-sentence</kbd>; or,

     </li>
<li>By typing whatever key or keychord the function is bound to, as with
<kbd>C-u 3 M-e</kbd>.
        </li>
</ol>

<p class="noindent">Both the examples just mentioned work identically to move point forward
three sentences.  (Since <code>multiply-by-seven</code> is not bound to a key,
it could not be used as an example of key binding.)

   </p>
<p>(See <a href="#Keybindings">Some Keybindings</a>, to learn how to bind a command
to a key.)

   </p>
<p>A <dfn>prefix argument</dfn> is passed to an interactive function by typing the
&lt;META&gt; key followed by a number, for example, <kbd>M-3 M-e</kbd>, or by
typing <kbd>C-u</kbd> and then a number, for example, <kbd>C-u 3 M-e</kbd> (if you
type <kbd>C-u</kbd> without a number, it defaults to 4).

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">3.3.1 An Interactive <code>multiply-by-seven</code>
</h4>

<p>Let's look at the use of the special form <code>interactive</code> and then at
the function <code>message</code> in the interactive version of
<code>multiply-by-seven</code>.  You will recall that the function definition
looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun multiply-by-seven (number)       ; <span class="roman">Interactive version.</span>
       "Multiply NUMBER by seven."
       (interactive "p")
       (message "The result is %d" (* 7 number)))
</pre>
   <p>In this function, the expression, <code>(interactive "p")</code>, is a list of
two elements.  The <code>"p"</code> tells Emacs to pass the prefix argument to
the function and use its value for the argument of the function.

   </p>
<p>The argument will be a number.  This means that the symbol
<code>number</code> will be bound to a number in the line:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (message "The result is %d" (* 7 number))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">For example, if your prefix argument is 5, the Lisp interpreter will
evaluate the line as if it were:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (message "The result is %d" (* 7 5))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(If you are reading this in GNU Emacs, you can evaluate this expression
yourself.)  First, the interpreter will evaluate the inner list, which
is <code>(* 7 5)</code>.  This returns a value of 35.  Next, it
will evaluate the outer list, passing the values of the second and
subsequent elements of the list to the function <code>message</code>.

   </p>
<p>As we have seen, <code>message</code> is an Emacs Lisp function especially
designed for sending a one line message to a user.  (See <a href="#message">The <code>message</code> function</a>.)  In summary, the <code>message</code>
function prints its first argument in the echo area as is, except for
occurrences of `<samp><span class="samp">%d</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>' (and various other %-sequences
which we have not mentioned).  When it sees a control sequence, the
function looks to the second or subsequent arguments and prints the
value of the argument in the location in the string where the control
sequence is located.

   </p>
<p>In the interactive <code>multiply-by-seven</code> function, the control string
is `<samp><span class="samp">%d</span></samp>', which requires a number, and the value returned by
evaluating <code>(* 7 5)</code> is the number 35.  Consequently, the number 35
is printed in place of the `<samp><span class="samp">%d</span></samp>' and the message is `<samp><span class="samp">The result
is 35</span></samp>'.

   </p>
<p>(Note that when you call the function <code>multiply-by-seven</code>, the
message is printed without quotes, but when you call <code>message</code>, the
text is printed in double quotes.  This is because the value returned by
<code>message</code> is what appears in the echo area when you evaluate an
expression whose first element is <code>message</code>; but when embedded in a
function, <code>message</code> prints the text as a side effect without
quotes.)

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Interactive-Options"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">3.4 Different Options for <code>interactive</code>
</h3>

<p><a name="index-Options-for-_0040code_007binteractive_007d-108"></a><a name="index-Interactive-options-109"></a>
In the example, <code>multiply-by-seven</code> used <code>"p"</code> as the
argument to <code>interactive</code>.  This argument told Emacs to interpret
your typing either <kbd>C-u</kbd> followed by a number or &lt;META&gt;
followed by a number as a command to pass that number to the function
as its argument.  Emacs has more than twenty characters predefined for
use with <code>interactive</code>.  In almost every case, one of these
options will enable you to pass the right information interactively to
a function.  (See <a href="elisp.html#Interactive-Codes">Code Characters for <code>interactive</code></a>.)

   </p>
<p>Consider the function <code>zap-to-char</code>.  Its interactive expression
is

<!-- FIXME: the interactive expression of zap-to-char has been changed -->
<!-- (in 2012-04-10). -->
</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (interactive "p\ncZap to char: ")
</pre>
   <p>The first part of the argument to <code>interactive</code> is `<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>', with
which you are already familiar.  This argument tells Emacs to
interpret a prefix, as a number to be passed to the function.  You
can specify a prefix either by typing <kbd>C-u</kbd> followed by a number
or by typing &lt;META&gt; followed by a number.  The prefix is the
number of specified characters.  Thus, if your prefix is three and the
specified character is `<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>', then you will delete all the text up
to and including the third next `<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>'.  If you do not set a prefix,
then you delete all the text up to and including the specified
character, but no more.

   </p>
<p>The `<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>' tells the function the name of the character to which to delete.

   </p>
<p>More formally, a function with two or more arguments can have
information passed to each argument by adding parts to the string that
follows <code>interactive</code>.  When you do this, the information is
passed to each argument in the same order it is specified in the
<code>interactive</code> list.  In the string, each part is separated from
the next part by a `<samp><span class="samp">\n</span></samp>', which is a newline.  For example, you
can follow `<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>' with a `<samp><span class="samp">\n</span></samp>' and an `<samp><span class="samp">cZap to char: </span></samp>'. 
This causes Emacs to pass the value of the prefix argument (if there
is one) and the character.

   </p>
<p>In this case, the function definition looks like the following, where
<code>arg</code> and <code>char</code> are the symbols to which <code>interactive</code>
binds the prefix argument and the specified character:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun <var>name-of-function</var> (arg char)
       "<var>documentation</var>..."
       (interactive "p\ncZap to char: ")
       <var>body-of-function</var>...)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(The space after the colon in the prompt makes it look better when you
are prompted.  See <a href="#copy_002dto_002dbuffer">The Definition of <code>copy-to-buffer</code></a>, for an example.)

   </p>
<p>When a function does not take arguments, <code>interactive</code> does not
require any.  Such a function contains the simple expression
<code>(interactive)</code>.  The <code>mark-whole-buffer</code> function is like
this.

   </p>
<p>Alternatively, if the special letter-codes are not right for your
application, you can pass your own arguments to <code>interactive</code> as
a list.

   </p>
<p>See <a href="#append_002dto_002dbuffer">The Definition of <code>append-to-buffer</code></a>,
for an example.  See <a href="elisp.html#Using-Interactive">Using <code>Interactive</code></a>, for a more complete
explanation about this technique.

<p><a name="index-Install-code-permanently-110"></a><a name="index-Permanent-code-installation-111"></a><a name="index-Code-installation-112"></a>
When you install a function definition by evaluating it, it will stay
installed until you quit Emacs.  The next time you start a new session
of Emacs, the function will not be installed unless you evaluate the
function definition again.

   </p>
<p>At some point, you may want to have code installed automatically
whenever you start a new session of Emacs.  There are several ways of
doing this:

     </p>
<ul>
<li>If you have code that is just for yourself, you can put the code for the
function definition in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> initialization file.  When you
start Emacs, your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file is automatically evaluated and all
the function definitions within it are installed. 
See <a href="#Emacs-Initialization">Your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> File</a>.

     </li>
<li>Alternatively, you can put the function definitions that you want
installed in one or more files of their own and use the <code>load</code>
function to cause Emacs to evaluate and thereby install each of the
functions in the files. 
See <a href="#Loading-Files">Loading Files</a>.

     </li>
<li>Thirdly, if you have code that your whole site will use, it is usual
to put it in a file called <samp><span class="file">site-init.el</span></samp> that is loaded when
Emacs is built.  This makes the code available to everyone who uses
your machine.  (See the <samp><span class="file">INSTALL</span></samp> file that is part of the Emacs
distribution.) 
</li>
</ul>

   <p>Finally, if you have code that everyone who uses Emacs may want, you
can post it on a computer network or send a copy to the Free Software
Foundation.  (When you do this, please license the code and its
documentation under a license that permits other people to run, copy,
study, modify, and redistribute the code and which protects you from
having your work taken from you.)  If you send a copy of your code to
the Free Software Foundation, and properly protect yourself and
others, it may be included in the next release of Emacs.  In large
part, this is how Emacs has grown over the past years, by donations.

<div class="node"><a name="let"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">3.6 <code>let</code>
</h3>

<p><a name="index-let-113"></a>
The <code>let</code> expression is a special form in Lisp that you will need
to use in most function definitions.

   </p>
<p><code>let</code> is used to attach or bind a symbol to a value in such a way
that the Lisp interpreter will not confuse the variable with a
variable of the same name that is not part of the function.

   </p>
<p>To understand why the <code>let</code> special form is necessary, consider
the situation in which you own a home that you generally refer to as
“the house”, as in the sentence, “The house needs painting.”  If you
are visiting a friend and your host refers to “the house”, he is
likely to be referring to <em>his</em> house, not yours, that is, to a
different house.

   </p>
<p>If your friend is referring to his house and you think he is referring
to your house, you may be in for some confusion.  The same thing could
happen in Lisp if a variable that is used inside of one function has
the same name as a variable that is used inside of another function,
and the two are not intended to refer to the same value.  The
<code>let</code> special form prevents this kind of confusion.

<code>let</code> Prevents Confusion</h4>

name for a <dfn>local variable</dfn> that overshadows any use of the same
name outside the <code>let</code> expression.  This is like understanding
that whenever your host refers to “the house”, he means his house, not
yours.  (Symbols used in argument lists work the same way. 
See <a href="#defun">The <code>defun</code> Macro</a>.)

   </p>
<p>Local variables created by a <code>let</code> expression retain their value
<em>only</em> within the <code>let</code> expression itself (and within
expressions called within the <code>let</code> expression); the local
variables have no effect outside the <code>let</code> expression.

   </p>
<p>Another way to think about <code>let</code> is that it is like a <code>setq</code>
that is temporary and local.  The values set by <code>let</code> are
automatically undone when the <code>let</code> is finished.  The setting
only affects expressions that are inside the bounds of the <code>let</code>
expression.  In computer science jargon, we would say the binding of
a symbol is visible only in functions called in the <code>let</code> form;
in Emacs Lisp, scoping is dynamic, not lexical.

   </p>
<p><code>let</code> can create more than one variable at once.  Also,
<code>let</code> gives each variable it creates an initial value, either a
value specified by you, or <code>nil</code>.  (In the jargon, this is
binding the variable to the value.)  After <code>let</code> has created
and bound the variables, it executes the code in the body of the
<code>let</code>, and returns the value of the last expression in the body,
as the value of the whole <code>let</code> expression.  (“Execute” is a jargon
term that means to evaluate a list; it comes from the use of the word
meaning “to give practical effect to” (<cite>Oxford English
Dictionary</cite>).  Since you evaluate an expression to perform an action,
“execute” has evolved as a synonym to “evaluate”.)

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Parts-of-let-Expression"></a></div>

<h4 class="subsection">3.6.1 The Parts of a <code>let</code> Expression</h4>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007blet_007d-expression_002c-parts-of-116"></a><a name="index-Parts-of-_0040code_007blet_007d-expression-117"></a>
<a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bvarlist_007d-defined-118"></a>A <code>let</code> expression is a list of three parts.  The first part is
the symbol <code>let</code>.  The second part is a list, called a
<dfn>varlist</dfn>, each element of which is either a symbol by itself or a
two-element list, the first element of which is a symbol.  The third
part of the <code>let</code> expression is the body of the <code>let</code>.  The
body usually consists of one or more lists.

   </p>
<p>A template for a <code>let</code> expression looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (let <var>varlist</var> <var>body</var>...)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The symbols in the varlist are the variables that are given initial
values by the <code>let</code> special form.  Symbols by themselves are given
the initial value of <code>nil</code>; and each symbol that is the first
element of a two-element list is bound to the value that is returned
when the Lisp interpreter evaluates the second element.

   </p>
<p>Thus, a varlist might look like this: <code>(thread (needles 3))</code>.  In
this case, in a <code>let</code> expression, Emacs binds the symbol
<code>thread</code> to an initial value of <code>nil</code>, and binds the symbol
<code>needles</code> to an initial value of 3.

   </p>
<p>When you write a <code>let</code> expression, what you do is put the
appropriate expressions in the slots of the <code>let</code> expression
template.

   </p>
<p>If the varlist is composed of two-element lists, as is often the case,
the template for the <code>let</code> expression looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (let ((<var>variable</var> <var>value</var>)
           (<var>variable</var> <var>value</var>)
           ...)

The following expression creates and gives initial values
to the two variables <code>zebra</code> and <code>tiger</code>.  The body of the
<code>let</code> expression is a list which calls the <code>message</code> function.

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (let ((zebra "stripes")
           (tiger "fierce"))
       (message "One kind of animal has %s and another is %s."
                zebra tiger))
</pre>
   <p>Here, the varlist is <code>((zebra "stripes") (tiger "fierce"))</code>.

   </p>
<p>The two variables are <code>zebra</code> and <code>tiger</code>.  Each variable is
the first element of a two-element list and each value is the second
element of its two-element list.  In the varlist, Emacs binds the
variable <code>zebra</code> to the value <code>"stripes"</code><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-8" name="fnd-8"><sup>8</sup></a>, and binds the
variable <code>tiger</code> to the value <code>"fierce"</code>.  In this example,
both values are strings.  The values could just as well have been
another list or a symbol.  The body of the <code>let</code>
follows after the list holding the variables.  In this example, the
body is a list that uses the <code>message</code> function to print a string
in the echo area.

   </p>
<p>You may evaluate the example in the usual fashion, by placing the
cursor after the last parenthesis and typing <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>.  When you do
this, the following will appear in the echo area:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     "One kind of animal has stripes and another is fierce."
</pre>
   <p>As we have seen before, the <code>message</code> function prints its first
argument, except for `<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>'.  In this example, the value of the variable
<code>zebra</code> is printed at the location of the first `<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>' and the
value of the variable <code>tiger</code> is printed at the location of the
second `<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>'.

If you do not bind the variables in a <code>let</code> statement to specific
initial values, they will automatically be bound to an initial value of
<code>nil</code>, as in the following expression:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (let ((birch 3)
           pine
           fir
           (oak 'some))

        "Here are %d variables with %s, %s, and %s value."
        birch pine fir oak))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here, the varlist is <code>((birch 3) pine fir (oak 'some))</code>.

   </p>
<p>If you evaluate this expression in the usual way, the following will
appear in your echo area:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     "Here are 3 variables with nil, nil, and some value."
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this example, Emacs binds the symbol <code>birch</code> to the number 3,
binds the symbols <code>pine</code> and <code>fir</code> to <code>nil</code>, and binds
the symbol <code>oak</code> to the value <code>some</code>.

   </p>
<p>Note that in the first part of the <code>let</code>, the variables <code>pine</code>
and <code>fir</code> stand alone as atoms that are not surrounded by
parentheses; this is because they are being bound to <code>nil</code>, the
empty list.  But <code>oak</code> is bound to <code>some</code> and so is a part of
the list <code>(oak 'some)</code>.  Similarly, <code>birch</code> is bound to the
number 3 and so is in a list with that number.  (Since a number
evaluates to itself, the number does not need to be quoted.  Also, the
number is printed in the message using a `<samp><span class="samp">%d</span></samp>' rather than a
`<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>'.)  The four variables as a group are put into a list to
delimit them from the body of the <code>let</code>.

A third special form, in addition to <code>defun</code> and <code>let</code>, is the
conditional <code>if</code>.  This form is used to instruct the computer to
make decisions.  You can write function definitions without using
<code>if</code>, but it is used often enough, and is important enough, to be
included here.  It is used, for example, in the code for the
function <code>beginning-of-buffer</code>.

   </p>
<p>The basic idea behind an <code>if</code>, is that <em>if</em> a test is true,
<em>then</em> an expression is evaluated.  If the test is not true, the
expression is not evaluated.  For example, you might make a decision
such as, “if it is warm and sunny, then go to the beach!”

the test and the action are the second and third elements of the list
whose first element is <code>if</code>.  Nonetheless, the test part of an
<code>if</code> expression is often called the <dfn>if-part</dfn> and the second
argument is often called the <dfn>then-part</dfn>.

   </p>
<p>Also, when an <code>if</code> expression is written, the true-or-false-test
is usually written on the same line as the symbol <code>if</code>, but the
action to carry out if the test is true, the then-part, is written
on the second and subsequent lines.  This makes the <code>if</code>
expression easier to read.

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (if <var>true-or-false-test</var>
         <var>action-to-carry-out-if-test-is-true</var>)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The true-or-false-test will be an expression that
is evaluated by the Lisp interpreter.

   </p>
<p>Here is an example that you can evaluate in the usual manner.  The test
is whether the number 5 is greater than the number 4.  Since it is, the
message `<samp><span class="samp">5 is greater than 4!</span></samp>' will be printed.

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (if (&gt; 5 4)                             ; <span class="roman">if-part</span>

its second argument and returns true if it is.) 
<a name="index-g_t_003e-_0028greater-than_0029-127"></a>
Of course, in actual use, the test in an <code>if</code> expression will not
be fixed for all time as it is by the expression <code>(&gt; 5 4)</code>. 
Instead, at least one of the variables used in the test will be bound to
a value that is not known ahead of time.  (If the value were known ahead
of time, we would not need to run the test!)

   </p>
<p>For example, the value may be bound to an argument of a function
definition.  In the following function definition, the character of the
animal is a value that is passed to the function.  If the value bound to
<code>characteristic</code> is <code>"fierce"</code>, then the message, `<samp><span class="samp">It is a
tiger!</span></samp>' will be printed; otherwise, <code>nil</code> will be returned.

<h4 class="subsection">3.7.1 The <code>type-of-animal</code> Function in Detail</h4>

<p>Let's look at the <code>type-of-animal</code> function in detail.

   </p>
<p>The function definition for <code>type-of-animal</code> was written by filling
the slots of two templates, one for a function definition as a whole, and
a second for an <code>if</code> expression.

   </p>
<p>The template for every function that is not interactive is:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun <var>name-of-function</var> (<var>argument-list</var>)
       "<var>documentation</var>..."
       <var>body</var>...)
</pre>
   <p>The parts of the function that match this template look like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun type-of-animal (characteristic)
       "Print message in echo area depending on CHARACTERISTIC.
     If the CHARACTERISTIC is the string \"fierce\",
     then warn of a tiger."
       <var>body: the</var> <code>if</code> <var>expression</var>)
</pre>
   <p>The name of function is <code>type-of-animal</code>; it is passed the value
of one argument.  The argument list is followed by a multi-line
documentation string.  The documentation string is included in the
example because it is a good habit to write documentation string for
every function definition.  The body of the function definition
consists of the <code>if</code> expression.

   </p>
<p>The template for an <code>if</code> expression looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (if <var>true-or-false-test</var>
         <var>action-to-carry-out-if-the-test-returns-true</var>)
</pre>
   <p>In the <code>type-of-animal</code> function, the code for the <code>if</code>
looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (if (equal characteristic "fierce")
         (message "It is a tiger!")))
</pre>
   <p>Here, the true-or-false-test is the expression:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (equal characteristic "fierce")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In Lisp, <code>equal</code> is a function that determines whether its first
argument is equal to its second argument.  The second argument is the
string <code>"fierce"</code> and the first argument is the value of the
symbol <code>characteristic</code>—in other words, the argument passed to
this function.

   </p>
<p>In the first exercise of <code>type-of-animal</code>, the argument
<code>"fierce"</code> is passed to <code>type-of-animal</code>.  Since <code>"fierce"</code>
is equal to <code>"fierce"</code>, the expression, <code>(equal characteristic
"fierce")</code>, returns a value of true.  When this happens, the <code>if</code>
evaluates the second argument or then-part of the <code>if</code>:
<code>(message "It is a tiger!")</code>.

   </p>
<p>On the other hand, in the second exercise of <code>type-of-animal</code>, the
argument <code>"striped"</code> is passed to <code>type-of-animal</code>.  <code>"striped"</code>
is not equal to <code>"fierce"</code>, so the then-part is not evaluated and
<code>nil</code> is returned by the <code>if</code> expression.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="else"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">3.8 If–then–else Expressions</h3>

<p><a name="index-Else-128"></a>
An <code>if</code> expression may have an optional third argument, called
the <dfn>else-part</dfn>, for the case when the true-or-false-test returns
false.  When this happens, the second argument or then-part of the
overall <code>if</code> expression is <em>not</em> evaluated, but the third or
else-part <em>is</em> evaluated.  You might think of this as the cloudy
day alternative for the decision “if it is warm and sunny, then go to
the beach, else read a book!”.

   </p>
<p>The word “else” is not written in the Lisp code; the else-part of an
<code>if</code> expression comes after the then-part.  In the written Lisp, the
else-part is usually written to start on a line of its own and is
indented less than the then-part:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (if <var>true-or-false-test</var>
         <var>action-to-carry-out-if-the-test-returns-true</var>
       <var>action-to-carry-out-if-the-test-returns-false</var>)
</pre>
   <p>For example, the following <code>if</code> expression prints the message `<samp><span class="samp">4
is not greater than 5!</span></samp>' when you evaluate it in the usual way:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (if (&gt; 4 5)                               ; <span class="roman">if-part</span>
         (message "4 falsely greater than 5!") ; <span class="roman">then-part</span>
       (message "4 is not greater than 5!"))   ; <span class="roman">else-part</span>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Note that the different levels of indentation make it easy to
distinguish the then-part from the else-part.  (GNU Emacs has several
commands that automatically indent <code>if</code> expressions correctly. 
See <a href="#Typing-Lists">GNU Emacs Helps You Type Lists</a>.)

   </p>
<p>We can extend the <code>type-of-animal</code> function to include an
else-part by simply incorporating an additional part to the <code>if</code>
expression.

   </p>
<p>You can see the consequences of doing this if you evaluate the following
version of the <code>type-of-animal</code> function definition to install it
and then evaluate the two subsequent expressions to pass different
arguments to the function.

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun type-of-animal (characteristic)  ; <span class="roman">Second version.</span>
       "Print message in echo area depending on CHARACTERISTIC.
     If the CHARACTERISTIC is the string \"fierce\",
     then warn of a tiger; else say it is not fierce."
       (if (equal characteristic "fierce")
           (message "It is a tiger!")
         (message "It is not fierce!")))
</pre>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<pre class="smallexample">     (type-of-animal "fierce")
     
     (type-of-animal "striped")
</pre>
   <!-- Following sentence rewritten to prevent overfull hbox. -->
<p class="noindent">When you evaluate <code>(type-of-animal "fierce")</code>, you will see the
following message printed in the echo area: <code>"It is a tiger!"</code>; but
when you evaluate <code>(type-of-animal "striped")</code>, you will see
<code>"It is not fierce!"</code>.

   </p>
<p>(Of course, if the <var>characteristic</var> were <code>"ferocious"</code>, the
message <code>"It is not fierce!"</code> would be printed; and it would be
misleading!  When you write code, you need to take into account the
possibility that some such argument will be tested by the <code>if</code>
and write your program accordingly.)

<h3 class="section">3.9 Truth and Falsehood in Emacs Lisp</h3>

<p><a name="index-Truth-and-falsehood-in-Emacs-Lisp-129"></a><a name="index-Falsehood-and-truth-in-Emacs-Lisp-130"></a><a name="index-nil-131"></a>
There is an important aspect to the truth test in an <code>if</code>
expression.  So far, we have spoken of “true” and “false” as values of
predicates as if they were new kinds of Emacs Lisp objects.  In fact,
“false” is just our old friend <code>nil</code>.  Anything else—anything
at all—is “true”.

   </p>
<p>The expression that tests for truth is interpreted as <dfn>true</dfn>
if the result of evaluating it is a value that is not <code>nil</code>.  In
other words, the result of the test is considered true if the value
returned is a number such as 47, a string such as <code>"hello"</code>, or a
symbol (other than <code>nil</code>) such as <code>flowers</code>, or a list (so
long as it is not empty), or even a buffer!

</p>
<ul class="menu">

</li>
</ul>

<div class="node"><a name="nil-explained"></a></div>

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">An explanation of <code>nil</code>
</h4>

   <p>Before illustrating a test for truth, we need an explanation of <code>nil</code>.

   </p>
<p>In Emacs Lisp, the symbol <code>nil</code> has two meanings.  First, it means the
empty list.  Second, it means false and is the value returned when a
true-or-false-test tests false.  <code>nil</code> can be written as an empty
list, <code>()</code>, or as <code>nil</code>.  As far as the Lisp interpreter is
concerned, <code>()</code> and <code>nil</code> are the same.  Humans, however, tend
to use <code>nil</code> for false and <code>()</code> for the empty list.

   </p>
<p>In Emacs Lisp, any value that is not <code>nil</code>—is not the empty
list—is considered true.  This means that if an evaluation returns
something that is not an empty list, an <code>if</code> expression will test
true.  For example, if a number is put in the slot for the test, it
will be evaluated and will return itself, since that is what numbers
do when evaluated.  In this conditional, the <code>if</code> expression will
test true.  The expression tests false only when <code>nil</code>, an empty
list, is returned by evaluating the expression.

   </p>
<p>You can see this by evaluating the two expressions in the following examples.

   </p>
<p>In the first example, the number 4 is evaluated as the test in the
<code>if</code> expression and returns itself; consequently, the then-part
of the expression is evaluated and returned: `<samp><span class="samp">true</span></samp>' appears in
the echo area.  In the second example, the <code>nil</code> indicates false;
consequently, the else-part of the expression is evaluated and
returned: `<samp><span class="samp">false</span></samp>' appears in the echo area.

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (if 4
         'true
       'false)
     
     (if nil
         'true
       'false)
</pre>
   <p>Incidentally, if some other useful value is not available for a test that
returns true, then the Lisp interpreter will return the symbol <code>t</code>
for true.  For example, the expression <code>(&gt; 5 4)</code> returns <code>t</code>
when evaluated, as you can see by evaluating it in the usual way:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (&gt; 5 4)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">On the other hand, this function returns <code>nil</code> if the test is false.

</p>

The <code>save-excursion</code> function is the third and final special form
that we will discuss in this chapter.

   </p>
<p>In Emacs Lisp programs used for editing, the <code>save-excursion</code>
function is very common.  It saves the location of point,
executes the body of the function, and then restores point to
its previous position if its location was changed.  Its primary
purpose is to keep the user from being surprised and disturbed by
unexpected movement of point.

</ul>

<div class="node"><a name="Point-and-mark"></a></div>

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Point and Mark</h4>

   <p>Before discussing <code>save-excursion</code>, however, it may be useful
first to review what point and mark are in GNU Emacs.  <dfn>Point</dfn> is
the current location of the cursor.  Wherever the cursor
is, that is point.  More precisely, on terminals where the cursor
appears to be on top of a character, point is immediately before the
character.  In Emacs Lisp, point is an integer.  The first character in
a buffer is number one, the second is number two, and so on.  The
function <code>point</code> returns the current position of the cursor as a
number.  Each buffer has its own value for point.

   </p>
<p>The <dfn>mark</dfn> is another position in the buffer; its value can be set
with a command such as <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> (<code>set-mark-command</code>).  If
a mark has been set, you can use the command <kbd>C-x C-x</kbd>
(<code>exchange-point-and-mark</code>) to cause the cursor to jump to the mark
and set the mark to be the previous position of point.  In addition, if
you set another mark, the position of the previous mark is saved in the
mark ring.  Many mark positions can be saved this way.  You can jump the
cursor to a saved mark by typing <kbd>C-u C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> one or more
times.

   </p>
<p>The part of the buffer between point and mark is called <dfn>the
region</dfn>.  Numerous commands work on the region, including
<code>center-region</code>, <code>count-lines-region</code>, <code>kill-region</code>, and
<code>print-region</code>.

   </p>
<p>The <code>save-excursion</code> special form saves the location of point and
restores this position after the code within the body of the
special form is evaluated by the Lisp interpreter.  Thus, if point were
in the beginning of a piece of text and some code moved point to the end
of the buffer, the <code>save-excursion</code> would put point back to where
it was before, after the expressions in the body of the function were
evaluated.

   </p>
<p>In Emacs, a function frequently moves point as part of its internal
workings even though a user would not expect this.  For example,
<code>count-lines-region</code> moves point.  To prevent the user from being
bothered by jumps that are both unexpected and (from the user's point of
view) unnecessary, <code>save-excursion</code> is often used to keep point in
the location expected by the user.  The use of
<code>save-excursion</code> is good housekeeping.

   </p>
<p>To make sure the house stays clean, <code>save-excursion</code> restores the
value of point even if something goes wrong in the code inside
of it (or, to be more precise and to use the proper jargon, “in case of
abnormal exit”).  This feature is very helpful.

   </p>
<p>In addition to recording the value of point,
<code>save-excursion</code> keeps track of the current buffer, and restores
it, too.  This means you can write code that will change the buffer and
have <code>save-excursion</code> switch you back to the original buffer. 
This is how <code>save-excursion</code> is used in <code>append-to-buffer</code>.

<h4 class="subsection">3.10.1 Template for a <code>save-excursion</code> Expression</h4>

<p>The template for code using <code>save-excursion</code> is simple:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (save-excursion
       <var>body</var>...)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The body of the function is one or more expressions that will be
evaluated in sequence by the Lisp interpreter.  If there is more than
one expression in the body, the value of the last one will be returned
as the value of the <code>save-excursion</code> function.  The other
expressions in the body are evaluated only for their side effects; and
<code>save-excursion</code> itself is used only for its side effect (which
is restoring the position of point).

   </p>
<p>In more detail, the template for a <code>save-excursion</code> expression
looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (save-excursion

</pre>
   <p class="noindent">An expression, of course, may be a symbol on its own or a list.

within the body of a <code>let</code> expression.  It looks like this:

</p>

</pre>
   <div class="node"><a name="Review"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">3.11 Review</h3>

<p>In the last few chapters we have introduced a macro and a fair number
of functions and special forms.  Here they are described in brief,
along with a few similar functions that have not been mentioned yet.

     </p>
<dl>
<dt><code>eval-last-sexp</code></dt>
<dd>Evaluate the last symbolic expression before the current location of
point.  The value is printed in the echo area unless the function is
invoked with an argument; in that case, the output is printed in the
current buffer.  This command is normally bound to <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>defun</code></dt>
<dd>Define function.  This macro has up to five parts: the name, a
template for the arguments that will be passed to the function,
documentation, an optional interactive declaration, and the body of
the definition.

     <p>For example, in Emacs the function definition of
<code>dired-unmark-all-marks</code> is as follows.

     </p>
<pre class="smallexample">          (defun dired-unmark-all-marks ()
            "Remove all marks from all files in the Dired buffer."
            (interactive)
            (dired-unmark-all-files ?\r))
     </pre>
     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>interactive</code></dt>
<dd>Declare to the interpreter that the function can be used
interactively.  This special form may be followed by a string with one
or more parts that pass the information to the arguments of the
function, in sequence.  These parts may also tell the interpreter to
prompt for information.  Parts of the string are separated by
newlines, `<samp><span class="samp">\n</span></samp>'.

     <p>Common code characters are:

          </p>
<dl>
<dt><code>b</code></dt>
<dd>The name of an existing buffer.

          <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>f</code></dt>
<dd>The name of an existing file.

          <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>p</code></dt>
<dd>The numeric prefix argument.  (Note that this <code>p</code> is lower case.)

          <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>r</code></dt>
<dd>Point and the mark, as two numeric arguments, smallest first.  This
is the only code letter that specifies two successive arguments
rather than one. 
</dd>
</dl>

     <p>See <a href="elisp.html#Interactive-Codes">Code Characters for `<samp><span class="samp">interactive</span></samp>'</a>, for a complete list of
code characters.

     <br></p>
</dd>
<dt><code>let</code></dt>
<dd>Declare that a list of variables is for use within the body of the
<code>let</code> and give them an initial value, either <code>nil</code> or a
specified value; then evaluate the rest of the expressions in the body
of the <code>let</code> and return the value of the last one.  Inside the
body of the <code>let</code>, the Lisp interpreter does not see the values of
the variables of the same names that are bound outside of the
<code>let</code>.

     <p>For example,

     </p>
<pre class="smallexample">          (let ((foo (buffer-name))
                (bar (buffer-size)))
            (message
             "This buffer is %s and has %d characters."
             foo bar))
     </pre>
     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>save-excursion</code></dt>
<dd>Record the values of point and the current buffer before
evaluating the body of this special form.  Restore the value of point and
buffer afterward.

     <p>For example,

     </p>
<pre class="smallexample">          (message "We are %d characters into this buffer."
                   (- (point)
                      (save-excursion
                        (goto-char (point-min)) (point))))
     </pre>
     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>if</code></dt>
<dd>Evaluate the first argument to the function; if it is true, evaluate
the second argument; else evaluate the third argument, if there is one.

     <p>The <code>if</code> special form is called a <dfn>conditional</dfn>.  There are
other conditionals in Emacs Lisp, but <code>if</code> is perhaps the most
commonly used.

     </p>
<p>For example,

     </p>
<pre class="smallexample">          (if (= 22 emacs-major-version)
              (message "This is version 22 Emacs")

</dd>
<dt>
<code>&lt;</code><dt>
<code>&gt;</code><dt>
<code>&lt;=</code><dt><code>&gt;=</code></dt>
</dt>
</dt>
</dt>
<dd>The <code>&lt;</code> function tests whether its first argument is smaller than
its second argument.  A corresponding function, <code>&gt;</code>, tests whether
the first argument is greater than the second.  Likewise, <code>&lt;=</code>
tests whether the first argument is less than or equal to the second and
<code>&gt;=</code> tests whether the first argument is greater than or equal to
the second.  In all cases, both arguments must be numbers or markers
(markers indicate positions in buffers).

     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>=</code></dt>
<dd>The <code>=</code> function tests whether two arguments, both numbers or
markers, are equal.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>equal</code><dt><code>eq</code></dt>
</dt>
<dd>Test whether two objects are the same.  <code>equal</code> uses one meaning
of the word “same” and <code>eq</code> uses another:  <code>equal</code> returns
true if the two objects have a similar structure and contents, such as
two copies of the same book.  On the other hand, <code>eq</code>, returns
true if both arguments are actually the same object.

</dd>
<dt>
<code>string&lt;</code><dt>
<code>string-lessp</code><dt>
<code>string=</code><dt><code>string-equal</code></dt>
</dt>
</dt>
</dt>
<dd>The <code>string-lessp</code> function tests whether its first argument is
smaller than the second argument.  A shorter, alternative name for the
same function (a <code>defalias</code>) is <code>string&lt;</code>.

     <p>The arguments to <code>string-lessp</code> must be strings or symbols; the
ordering is lexicographic, so case is significant.  The print names of
symbols are used instead of the symbols themselves.

     </p>
<p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bempty-string_007d-defined-140"></a>An empty string, `<samp><span class="samp">""</span></samp>', a string with no characters in it, is
smaller than any string of characters.

     </p>
<p><code>string-equal</code> provides the corresponding test for equality.  Its
shorter, alternative name is <code>string=</code>.  There are no string test
functions that correspond to <var>&gt;</var>, <code>&gt;=</code>, or <code>&lt;=</code>.

     <br></p>
</dd>
<dt><code>message</code></dt>
<dd>Print a message in the echo area.  The first argument is a string that
can contain `<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">%d</span></samp>', or `<samp><span class="samp">%c</span></samp>' to print the value of
arguments that follow the string.  The argument used by `<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>' must
be a string or a symbol; the argument used by `<samp><span class="samp">%d</span></samp>' must be a
number.  The argument used by `<samp><span class="samp">%c</span></samp>' must be an <span class="sc">ascii</span> code
number; it will be printed as the character with that <span class="sc">ascii</span> code. 
(Various other %-sequences have not been mentioned.)

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>setq</code><dt><code>set</code></dt>
</dt>
<dd>The <code>setq</code> function sets the value of its first argument to the
value of the second argument.  The first argument is automatically
quoted by <code>setq</code>.  It does the same for succeeding pairs of
arguments.  Another function, <code>set</code>, takes only two arguments and
evaluates both of them before setting the value returned by its first
argument to the value returned by its second argument.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>buffer-name</code></dt>
<dd>Without an argument, return the name of the buffer, as a string.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>buffer-file-name</code></dt>
<dd>Without an argument, return the name of the file the buffer is
visiting.

     <br>

<dt><code>current-buffer</code></dt>
<dd>Return the buffer in which Emacs is active; it may not be
the buffer that is visible on the screen.

<dt><code>other-buffer</code></dt>
<dd>Return the most recently selected buffer (other than the buffer passed
to <code>other-buffer</code> as an argument and other than the current
buffer).

     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>switch-to-buffer</code></dt>
<dd>Select a buffer for Emacs to be active in and display it in the current
window so users can look at it.  Usually bound to <kbd>C-x b</kbd>.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>set-buffer</code></dt>
<dd>Switch Emacs's attention to a buffer on which programs will run.  Don't
alter what the window is showing.

<h2 class="chapter">4 A Few Buffer-Related Functions</h2>

<p>In this chapter we study in detail several of the functions used in GNU
Emacs.  This is called a “walk-through”.  These functions are used as
examples of Lisp code, but are not imaginary examples; with the
exception of the first, simplified function definition, these functions
show the actual code used in GNU Emacs.  You can learn a great deal from
these definitions.  The functions described here are all related to
buffers.  Later, we will study other functions.

it, sometimes in detail and sometimes briefly.  If you are interested,
you can get the full documentation of any Emacs Lisp function at any
time by typing <kbd>C-h f</kbd> and then the name of the function (and then
&lt;RET&gt;).  Similarly, you can get the full documentation for a

   </p>
<p>More generally, if you want to see a function in its original source
file, you can use the <code>xref-find-definitions</code> function to jump to
it.  <code>xref-find-definitions</code> works with a wide variety of

at the prompt, type in the name of the function whose source code you
want to see, such as <code>mark-whole-buffer</code>, and then type
&lt;RET&gt;.  Emacs will switch buffers and display the source code for

called <dfn>libraries</dfn>.  The metaphor is derived from that of a
specialized library, such as a law library or an engineering library,
rather than a general library.  Each library, or file, contains
functions that relate to a particular topic or activity, such as
<samp><span class="file">abbrev.el</span></samp> for handling abbreviations and other typing
shortcuts, and <samp><span class="file">help.el</span></samp> for help.  (Sometimes several

<h3 class="section">4.2 A Simplified <code>beginning-of-buffer</code> Definition</h3>

<p><a name="index-simplified_002dbeginning_002dof_002dbuffer-145"></a>
The <code>beginning-of-buffer</code> command is a good function to start with
since you are likely to be familiar with it and it is easy to
understand.  Used as an interactive command, <code>beginning-of-buffer</code>
moves the cursor to the beginning of the buffer, leaving the mark at the
previous position.  It is generally bound to <kbd>M-&lt;</kbd>.

   </p>
<p>In this section, we will discuss a shortened version of the function
that shows how it is most frequently used.  This shortened function
works as written, but it does not contain the code for a complex option. 
In another section, we will describe the entire function. 
(See <a href="#beginning_002dof_002dbuffer">Complete Definition of <code>beginning-of-buffer</code></a>.)

   </p>
<p>Before looking at the code, let's consider what the function
definition has to contain: it must include an expression that makes
the function interactive so it can be called by typing <kbd>M-x
beginning-of-buffer</kbd> or by typing a keychord such as <kbd>M-&lt;</kbd>; it
must include code to leave a mark at the original position in the
buffer; and it must include code to move the cursor to the beginning
of the buffer.

   </p>
<p>Here is the complete text of the shortened version of the function:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun simplified-beginning-of-buffer ()
       "Move point to the beginning of the buffer;
     leave mark at previous position."
       (interactive)
       (push-mark)
       (goto-char (point-min)))
</pre>
   <p>Like all function definitions, this definition has five parts following
the macro <code>defun</code>:

     </p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>The name: in this example, <code>simplified-beginning-of-buffer</code>.

     </li>
<li>A list of the arguments: in this example, an empty list, <code>()</code>,

     </li>
<li>The documentation string.

     </li>
<li>The interactive expression.

     </li>
<li>The body.
        </li>
</ol>

<p class="noindent">In this function definition, the argument list is empty; this means that
this function does not require any arguments.  (When we look at the
definition for the complete function, we will see that it may be passed
an optional argument.)

   </p>
<p>The interactive expression tells Emacs that the function is intended to
be used interactively.  In this example, <code>interactive</code> does not have
an argument because <code>simplified-beginning-of-buffer</code> does not
require one.

   </p>
<p>The body of the function consists of the two lines:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (push-mark)
     (goto-char (point-min))
</pre>
   <p>The first of these lines is the expression, <code>(push-mark)</code>.  When
this expression is evaluated by the Lisp interpreter, it sets a mark at
the current position of the cursor, wherever that may be.  The position
of this mark is saved in the mark ring.

   </p>
<p>The next line is <code>(goto-char (point-min))</code>.  This expression
jumps the cursor to the minimum point in the buffer, that is, to the
beginning of the buffer (or to the beginning of the accessible portion
of the buffer if it is narrowed.  See <a href="#Narrowing-_0026-Widening">Narrowing and Widening</a>.)

   </p>
<p>The <code>push-mark</code> command sets a mark at the place where the cursor
was located before it was moved to the beginning of the buffer by the
<code>(goto-char (point-min))</code> expression.  Consequently, you can, if
you wish, go back to where you were originally by typing <kbd>C-x C-x</kbd>.

   </p>
<p>That is all there is to the function definition!

   </p>
<p><a name="index-describe_002dfunction-146"></a>When you are reading code such as this and come upon an unfamiliar
function, such as <code>goto-char</code>, you can find out what it does by
using the <code>describe-function</code> command.  To use this command, type
<kbd>C-h f</kbd> and then type in the name of the function and press
&lt;RET&gt;.  The <code>describe-function</code> command will print the
function's documentation string in a <samp><span class="file">*Help*</span></samp> window.  For
example, the documentation for <code>goto-char</code> is:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     Set point to POSITION, a number or marker.
     Beginning of buffer is position (point-min), end is (point-max).
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The function's one argument is the desired position.

</p>
<p class="noindent">(The prompt for <code>describe-function</code> will offer you the symbol
under or preceding the cursor, so you can save typing by positioning
the cursor right over or after the function and then typing <kbd>C-h f
&lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.)

   </p>
<p>The <code>end-of-buffer</code> function definition is written in the same way as
the <code>beginning-of-buffer</code> definition except that the body of the
function contains the expression <code>(goto-char (point-max))</code> in place
of <code>(goto-char (point-min))</code>.

<h3 class="section">4.3 The Definition of <code>mark-whole-buffer</code>
</h3>

<p><a name="index-mark_002dwhole_002dbuffer-147"></a>
The <code>mark-whole-buffer</code> function is no harder to understand than the
<code>simplified-beginning-of-buffer</code> function.  In this case, however,
we will look at the complete function, not a shortened version.

   </p>
<p>The <code>mark-whole-buffer</code> function is not as commonly used as the
<code>beginning-of-buffer</code> function, but is useful nonetheless: it
marks a whole buffer as a region by putting point at the beginning and
a mark at the end of the buffer.  It is generally bound to <kbd>C-x
h</kbd>.

</div>

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">An overview of <code>mark-whole-buffer</code>
</h4>

   <p>In GNU Emacs 22, the code for the complete function looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun mark-whole-buffer ()
       "Put point at beginning and mark at end of buffer.
     You probably should not use this function in Lisp programs;
     it is usually a mistake for a Lisp function to use any subroutine
     that uses or sets the mark."
       (interactive)
       (push-mark (point))
       (push-mark (point-max) nil t)
       (goto-char (point-min)))
</pre>
   <p>Like all other functions, the <code>mark-whole-buffer</code> function fits
into the template for a function definition.  The template looks like
this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun <var>name-of-function</var> (<var>argument-list</var>)
       "<var>documentation</var>..."
       (<var>interactive-expression</var>...)
       <var>body</var>...)
</pre>
   <p>Here is how the function works: the name of the function is
<code>mark-whole-buffer</code>; it is followed by an empty argument list,
`<samp><span class="samp">()</span></samp>', which means that the function does not require arguments. 
The documentation comes next.

   </p>
<p>The next line is an <code>(interactive)</code> expression that tells Emacs
that the function will be used interactively.  These details are similar
to the <code>simplified-beginning-of-buffer</code> function described in the
previous section.

</p>
<div class="node">
<a name="Body-of-mark-whole-buffer"></a><a name="Body-of-mark_002dwhole_002dbuffer"></a>
</div>

<h4 class="subsection">4.3.1 Body of <code>mark-whole-buffer</code>
</h4>

<p>The body of the <code>mark-whole-buffer</code> function consists of three
lines of code:

<!-- GNU Emacs 22 -->
</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (push-mark (point))
     (push-mark (point-max) nil t)
     (goto-char (point-min))
</pre>
   <p>The first of these lines is the expression, <code>(push-mark (point))</code>.

   </p>
<p>This line does exactly the same job as the first line of the body of
the <code>simplified-beginning-of-buffer</code> function, which is written
<code>(push-mark)</code>.  In both cases, the Lisp interpreter sets a mark
at the current position of the cursor.

   </p>
<p>I don't know why the expression in <code>mark-whole-buffer</code> is written
<code>(push-mark (point))</code> and the expression in
<code>beginning-of-buffer</code> is written <code>(push-mark)</code>.  Perhaps
whoever wrote the code did not know that the arguments for
<code>push-mark</code> are optional and that if <code>push-mark</code> is not
passed an argument, the function automatically sets mark at the
location of point by default.  Or perhaps the expression was written
so as to parallel the structure of the next line.  In any case, the
line causes Emacs to determine the position of point and set a mark
there.

   </p>
<p>In earlier versions of GNU Emacs, the next line of
<code>mark-whole-buffer</code> was <code>(push-mark (point-max))</code>.  This
expression sets a mark at the point in the buffer that has the highest
number.  This will be the end of the buffer (or, if the buffer is
narrowed, the end of the accessible portion of the buffer. 
See <a href="#Narrowing-_0026-Widening">Narrowing and Widening</a>, for more about
narrowing.)  After this mark has been set, the previous mark, the one
set at point, is no longer set, but Emacs remembers its position, just
as all other recent marks are always remembered.  This means that you
can, if you wish, go back to that position by typing <kbd>C-u
C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> twice.

   </p>
<p>In GNU Emacs 22, the <code>(point-max)</code> is slightly more complicated. 
The line reads

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (push-mark (point-max) nil t)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The expression works nearly the same as before.  It sets a mark at the
highest numbered place in the buffer that it can.  However, in this
version, <code>push-mark</code> has two additional arguments.  The second
argument to <code>push-mark</code> is <code>nil</code>.  This tells the function
it <em>should</em> display a message that says “Mark set” when it pushes
the mark.  The third argument is <code>t</code>.  This tells
<code>push-mark</code> to activate the mark when Transient Mark mode is
turned on.  Transient Mark mode highlights the currently active
region.  It is often turned off.

   </p>
<p>Finally, the last line of the function is <code>(goto-char
(point-min)))</code>.  This is written exactly the same way as it is written
in <code>beginning-of-buffer</code>.  The expression moves the cursor to
the minimum point in the buffer, that is, to the beginning of the buffer
(or to the beginning of the accessible portion of the buffer).  As a
result of this, point is placed at the beginning of the buffer and mark
is set at the end of the buffer.  The whole buffer is, therefore, the
region.

<p><a name="index-append_002dto_002dbuffer-148"></a>
The <code>append-to-buffer</code> command is more complex than the

</h4>

   <p><a name="index-insert_002dbuffer_002dsubstring-149"></a>The <code>append-to-buffer</code> command uses the
<code>insert-buffer-substring</code> function to copy the region. 
<code>insert-buffer-substring</code> is described by its name: it takes a
substring from a buffer, and inserts it into another buffer.

   </p>
<p>Most of <code>append-to-buffer</code> is
concerned with setting up the conditions for
<code>insert-buffer-substring</code> to work: the code must specify both the
buffer to which the text will go, the window it comes from and goes
to, and the region that will be copied.

   </p>
<p>Here is the complete text of the function:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun append-to-buffer (buffer start end)

             (insert-buffer-substring oldbuf start end)
             (dolist (window windows)
               (when (= (window-point window) point)
                 (set-window-point window (point))))))))
</pre>
   <p>The function can be understood by looking at it as a series of
filled-in templates.

   </p>
<p>The outermost template is for the function definition.  In this
function, it looks like this (with several slots filled in):

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun append-to-buffer (buffer start end)
       "<var>documentation</var>..."
       (interactive ...)
       <var>body</var>...)
</pre>
   <p>The first line of the function includes its name and three arguments. 
The arguments are the <code>buffer</code> to which the text will be copied, and
the <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> of the region in the current buffer that
will be copied.

   </p>
<p>The next part of the function is the documentation, which is clear and
complete.  As is conventional, the three arguments are written in
upper case so you will notice them easily.  Even better, they are
described in the same order as in the argument list.

   </p>
<p>Note that the documentation distinguishes between a buffer and its
name.  (The function can handle either.)

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="append-interactive"></a></div>

<h4 class="subsection">4.4.1 The <code>append-to-buffer</code> Interactive Expression</h4>

<p>Since the <code>append-to-buffer</code> function will be used interactively,
the function must have an <code>interactive</code> expression.  (For a
review of <code>interactive</code>, see <a href="#Interactive">Making a Function Interactive</a>.)  The expression reads as follows:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (interactive
      (list (read-buffer
             "Append to buffer: "
             (other-buffer (current-buffer) t))
            (region-beginning)
            (region-end)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This expression is not one with letters standing for parts, as
described earlier.  Instead, it starts a list with these parts:

   </p>
<p>The first part of the list is an expression to read the name of a
buffer and return it as a string.  That is <code>read-buffer</code>.  The
function requires a prompt as its first argument, `<samp><span class="samp">"Append to
buffer: "</span></samp>'.  Its second argument tells the command what value to
provide if you don't specify anything.

   </p>
<p>In this case that second argument is an expression containing the
function <code>other-buffer</code>, an exception, and a `<samp><span class="samp">t</span></samp>', standing
for true.

   </p>
<p>The first argument to <code>other-buffer</code>, the exception, is yet
another function, <code>current-buffer</code>.  That is not going to be
returned.  The second argument is the symbol for true, <code>t</code>. that
tells <code>other-buffer</code> that it may show visible buffers (except in
this case, it will not show the current buffer, which makes sense).

   </p>
<p>The expression looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (other-buffer (current-buffer) t)
</pre>
   <p>The second and third arguments to the <code>list</code> expression are
<code>(region-beginning)</code> and <code>(region-end)</code>.  These two
functions specify the beginning and end of the text to be appended.

   </p>
<p>Originally, the command used the letters `<samp><span class="samp">B</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">r</span></samp>'. 
The whole <code>interactive</code> expression looked like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (interactive "BAppend to buffer: \nr")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">But when that was done, the default value of the buffer switched to
was invisible.  That was not wanted.

   </p>
<p>(The prompt was separated from the second argument with a newline,
`<samp><span class="samp">\n</span></samp>'.  It was followed by an `<samp><span class="samp">r</span></samp>' that told Emacs to bind the
two arguments that follow the symbol <code>buffer</code> in the function's
argument list (that is, <code>start</code> and <code>end</code>) to the values of
point and mark.  That argument worked fine.)

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">4.4.2 The Body of <code>append-to-buffer</code>
</h4>

<p>The body of the <code>append-to-buffer</code> function begins with <code>let</code>.

   </p>
<p>As we have seen before (see <a href="#let"><code>let</code></a>), the purpose of a
<code>let</code> expression is to create and give initial values to one or
more variables that will only be used within the body of the
<code>let</code>.  This means that such a variable will not be confused with
any variable of the same name outside the <code>let</code> expression.

   </p>
<p>We can see how the <code>let</code> expression fits into the function as a
whole by showing a template for <code>append-to-buffer</code> with the
<code>let</code> expression in outline:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun append-to-buffer (buffer start end)
       "<var>documentation</var>..."
       (interactive ...)
       (let ((<var>variable</var> <var>value</var>))
             <var>body</var>...)
</pre>
   <p>The <code>let</code> expression has three elements:

     </p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>The symbol <code>let</code>;

     </li>
<li>A varlist containing, in this case, a single two-element list,
<code>(</code><var>variable</var> <var>value</var><code>)</code>;

     </li>
<li>The body of the <code>let</code> expression.
        </li>
</ol>

   <p>In the <code>append-to-buffer</code> function, the varlist looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (oldbuf (current-buffer))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this part of the <code>let</code> expression, the one variable,
<code>oldbuf</code>, is bound to the value returned by the
<code>(current-buffer)</code> expression.  The variable, <code>oldbuf</code>, is
used to keep track of the buffer in which you are working and from
which you will copy.

   </p>
<p>The element or elements of a varlist are surrounded by a set of
parentheses so the Lisp interpreter can distinguish the varlist from
the body of the <code>let</code>.  As a consequence, the two-element list
within the varlist is surrounded by a circumscribing set of parentheses. 
The line looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (let ((oldbuf (current-buffer)))
       ... )
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The two parentheses before <code>oldbuf</code> might surprise you if you did
not realize that the first parenthesis before <code>oldbuf</code> marks the
boundary of the varlist and the second parenthesis marks the beginning
of the two-element list, <code>(oldbuf (current-buffer))</code>.

<a name="append-save-excursion"></a><a name="append-save_002dexcursion"></a>
</div>

<h4 class="subsection">4.4.3 <code>save-excursion</code> in <code>append-to-buffer</code>
</h4>

<p>The body of the <code>let</code> expression in <code>append-to-buffer</code>
consists of a <code>save-excursion</code> expression.

   </p>
<p>The <code>save-excursion</code> function saves the location of point, and restores it
to that position after the expressions in the
body of the <code>save-excursion</code> complete execution.  In addition,
<code>save-excursion</code> keeps track of the original buffer, and
restores it.  This is how <code>save-excursion</code> is used in
<code>append-to-buffer</code>.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-Indentation-for-formatting-150"></a><a name="index-Formatting-convention-151"></a>Incidentally, it is worth noting here that a Lisp function is normally
formatted so that everything that is enclosed in a multi-line spread is
indented more to the right than the first symbol.  In this function
definition, the <code>let</code> is indented more than the <code>defun</code>, and
the <code>save-excursion</code> is indented more than the <code>let</code>, like
this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun ...
       ...
       ...
       (let...
         (save-excursion
           ...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This formatting convention makes it easy to see that the lines in
the body of the <code>save-excursion</code> are enclosed by the parentheses
associated with <code>save-excursion</code>, just as the
<code>save-excursion</code> itself is enclosed by the parentheses associated
with the <code>let</code>:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (let ((oldbuf (current-buffer)))
       (save-excursion
         ...
         (set-buffer ...)
         (insert-buffer-substring oldbuf start end)
         ...))
</pre>
   <p>The use of the <code>save-excursion</code> function can be viewed as a process
of filling in the slots of a template:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (save-excursion
       <var>first-expression-in-body</var>
       <var>second-expression-in-body</var>
        ...
       <var>last-expression-in-body</var>)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this function, the body of the <code>save-excursion</code> contains only
one expression, the <code>let*</code> expression.  You know about a
<code>let</code> function.  The <code>let*</code> function is different.  It has a
`<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' in its name.  It enables Emacs to set each variable in its
varlist in sequence, one after another.

   </p>
<p>Its critical feature is that variables later in the varlist can make
use of the values to which Emacs set variables earlier in the varlist. 
See <a href="#fwd_002dpara-let">The <code>let*</code> expression</a>.

   </p>
<p>We will skip functions like <code>let*</code> and focus on two: the
<code>set-buffer</code> function and the <code>insert-buffer-substring</code>
function.

   </p>
<p>In the old days, the <code>set-buffer</code> expression was simply

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (set-buffer (get-buffer-create buffer))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">but now it is

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (set-buffer append-to)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><code>append-to</code> is bound to <code>(get-buffer-create buffer)</code> earlier
on in the <code>let*</code> expression.  That extra binding would not be
necessary except for that <code>append-to</code> is used later in the
varlist as an argument to <code>get-buffer-window-list</code>.

   </p>
<p>The <code>append-to-buffer</code> function definition inserts text from the
buffer in which you are currently to a named buffer.  It happens that
<code>insert-buffer-substring</code> copies text from another buffer to the
current buffer, just the reverse—that is why the
<code>append-to-buffer</code> definition starts out with a <code>let</code> that
binds the local symbol <code>oldbuf</code> to the value returned by
<code>current-buffer</code>.

   </p>
<p>The <code>insert-buffer-substring</code> expression looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (insert-buffer-substring oldbuf start end)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The <code>insert-buffer-substring</code> function copies a string
<em>from</em> the buffer specified as its first argument and inserts the
string into the present buffer.  In this case, the argument to
<code>insert-buffer-substring</code> is the value of the variable created
and bound by the <code>let</code>, namely the value of <code>oldbuf</code>, which
was the current buffer when you gave the <code>append-to-buffer</code>
command.

   </p>
<p>After <code>insert-buffer-substring</code> has done its work,
<code>save-excursion</code> will restore the action to the original buffer
and <code>append-to-buffer</code> will have done its job.

   </p>
<p>Written in skeletal form, the workings of the body look like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (let (<var>bind-</var><code>oldbuf</code><var>-to-value-of-</var><code>current-buffer</code>)
       (save-excursion                       ; <span class="roman">Keep track of buffer.</span>
         <var>change-buffer</var>
         <var>insert-substring-from-</var><code>oldbuf</code><var>-into-buffer</var>)
     
       <var>change-back-to-original-buffer-when-finished</var>
     <var>let-the-local-meaning-of-</var><code>oldbuf</code><var>-disappear-when-finished</var>
</pre>
   <p>In summary, <code>append-to-buffer</code> works as follows: it saves the
value of the current buffer in the variable called <code>oldbuf</code>.  It
gets the new buffer (creating one if need be) and switches Emacs's
attention to it.  Using the value of <code>oldbuf</code>, it inserts the
region of text from the old buffer into the new buffer; and then using
<code>save-excursion</code>, it brings you back to your original buffer.

   </p>
<p>In looking at <code>append-to-buffer</code>, you have explored a fairly
complex function.  It shows how to use <code>let</code> and
<code>save-excursion</code>, and how to change to and come back from another
buffer.  Many function definitions use <code>let</code>,
<code>save-excursion</code>, and <code>set-buffer</code> this way.

</div>

<h3 class="section">5.1 The Definition of <code>copy-to-buffer</code>
</h3>

<p><a name="index-copy_002dto_002dbuffer-152"></a>
After understanding how <code>append-to-buffer</code> works, it is easy to
understand <code>copy-to-buffer</code>.  This function copies text into a
buffer, but instead of adding to the second buffer, it replaces all the
previous text in the second buffer.

   </p>
<p>The body of <code>copy-to-buffer</code> looks like this,

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ...
     (interactive "BCopy to buffer: \nr")
     (let ((oldbuf (current-buffer)))
       (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create buffer)
         (barf-if-buffer-read-only)
         (erase-buffer)
         (save-excursion
           (insert-buffer-substring oldbuf start end)))))
</pre>
   <p>The <code>copy-to-buffer</code> function has a simpler <code>interactive</code>
expression than <code>append-to-buffer</code>.

   </p>
<p>The definition then says

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create buffer) ...
</pre>
   <p>First, look at the earliest inner expression; that is evaluated first. 
That expression starts with <code>get-buffer-create buffer</code>.  The
function tells the computer to use the buffer with the name specified
as the one to which you are copying, or if such a buffer does not
exist, to create it.  Then, the <code>with-current-buffer</code> function
evaluates its body with that buffer temporarily current.

   </p>
<p>(This demonstrates another way to shift the computer's attention but
not the user's.  The <code>append-to-buffer</code> function showed how to do
the same with <code>save-excursion</code> and <code>set-buffer</code>. 
<code>with-current-buffer</code> is a newer, and arguably easier,
mechanism.)

   </p>
<p>The <code>barf-if-buffer-read-only</code> function sends you an error
message saying the buffer is read-only if you cannot modify it.

   </p>
<p>The next line has the <code>erase-buffer</code> function as its sole
contents.  That function erases the buffer.

   </p>
<p>Finally, the last two lines contain the <code>save-excursion</code>
expression with <code>insert-buffer-substring</code> as its body. 
The  <code>insert-buffer-substring</code> expression copies the text from
the buffer you are in (and you have not seen the computer shift its
attention, so you don't know that that buffer is now called
<code>oldbuf</code>).

   </p>
<p>Incidentally, this is what is meant by “replacement”.  To replace text,
Emacs erases the previous text and then inserts new text.

   </p>
<p>In outline, the body of <code>copy-to-buffer</code> looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (let (<var>bind-</var><code>oldbuf</code><var>-to-value-of-</var><code>current-buffer</code>)
         (<var>with-the-buffer-you-are-copying-to</var>
           (<var>but-do-not-erase-or-copy-to-a-read-only-buffer</var>)
           (erase-buffer)
           (save-excursion
             <var>insert-substring-from-</var><code>oldbuf</code><var>-into-buffer</var>)))
</pre>
   <div class="node">
<a name="insert-buffer"></a><a name="insert_002dbuffer"></a>
</div>

<h3 class="section">5.2 The Definition of <code>insert-buffer</code>
</h3>

<p><a name="index-insert_002dbuffer-153"></a>
<code>insert-buffer</code> is yet another buffer-related function.  This
command copies another buffer <em>into</em> the current buffer.  It is the
reverse of <code>append-to-buffer</code> or <code>copy-to-buffer</code>, since they
copy a region of text <em>from</em> the current buffer to another buffer.

   </p>
<p>Here is a discussion based on the original code.  The code was
simplified in 2003 and is harder to understand.

   </p>
<p>(See <a href="#New-insert_002dbuffer">New Body for <code>insert-buffer</code></a>, to see
a discussion of the new body.)

   </p>
<p>In addition, this code illustrates the use of <code>interactive</code> with a
buffer that might be <dfn>read-only</dfn> and the important distinction
between the name of an object and the object actually referred to.

</h4>

<p><a name="index-interactive_002c-_0040r_007bexample-use-of_007d-154"></a>
In <code>insert-buffer</code>, the argument to the <code>interactive</code>
declaration has two parts, an asterisk, `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>', and `<samp><span class="samp">bInsert
buffer: </span></samp>'.

</p>
<ul class="menu">

The asterisk is for the situation when the current buffer is a
read-only buffer—a buffer that cannot be modified.  If
<code>insert-buffer</code> is called when the current buffer is read-only, a
message to this effect is printed in the echo area and the terminal
may beep or blink at you; you will not be permitted to insert anything
into current buffer.  The asterisk does not need to be followed by a
newline to separate it from the next argument.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="b-for-interactive"></a></div>

<h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">`<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>' in an Interactive Expression</h5>

<p>The next argument in the interactive expression starts with a lower
case `<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>'.  (This is different from the code for
<code>append-to-buffer</code>, which uses an upper-case `<samp><span class="samp">B</span></samp>'. 
See <a href="#append_002dto_002dbuffer">The Definition of <code>append-to-buffer</code></a>.) 
The lower-case `<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>' tells the Lisp interpreter that the argument
for <code>insert-buffer</code> should be an existing buffer or else its
name.  (The upper-case `<samp><span class="samp">B</span></samp>' option provides for the possibility
that the buffer does not exist.)  Emacs will prompt you for the name
of the buffer, offering you a default buffer, with name completion
enabled.  If the buffer does not exist, you receive a message that
says “No match”; your terminal may beep at you as well.

   </p>
<p>The new and simplified code generates a list for <code>interactive</code>. 
It uses the <code>barf-if-buffer-read-only</code> and <code>read-buffer</code>
functions with which we are already familiar and the <code>progn</code>
special form with which we are not.  (It will be described later.)

<h4 class="subsection">5.2.2 The Body of the <code>insert-buffer</code> Function</h4>

<p>The body of the <code>insert-buffer</code> function has two major parts: an
<code>or</code> expression and a <code>let</code> expression.  The purpose of the
<code>or</code> expression is to ensure that the argument <code>buffer</code> is
bound to a buffer and not just the name of a buffer.  The body of the
<code>let</code> expression contains the code which copies the other buffer
into the current buffer.

   </p>
<p>In outline, the two expressions fit into the <code>insert-buffer</code>
function like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun insert-buffer (buffer)
       "<var>documentation</var>..."
       (interactive "*bInsert buffer: ")
       (or ...
           ...
       (let (<var>varlist</var>)
           <var>body-of-</var><code>let</code>... )
</pre>
   <p>To understand how the <code>or</code> expression ensures that the argument
<code>buffer</code> is bound to a buffer and not to the name of a buffer, it
is first necessary to understand the <code>or</code> function.

   </p>
<p>Before doing this, let me rewrite this part of the function using
<code>if</code> so that you can see what is done in a manner that will be familiar.

</p>
<div class="node">
<a name="if-%26-or"></a><a name="if-_0026-or"></a>
</div>

<h4 class="subsection">5.2.3 <code>insert-buffer</code> With an <code>if</code> Instead of an <code>or</code>
</h4>

<p>The job to be done is to make sure the value of <code>buffer</code> is a
buffer itself and not the name of a buffer.  If the value is the name,
then the buffer itself must be got.

   </p>
<p>You can imagine yourself at a conference where an usher is wandering
around holding a list with your name on it and looking for you: the
usher is bound to your name, not to you; but when the usher finds
you and takes your arm, the usher becomes bound to you.

   </p>
<p>In Lisp, you might describe this situation like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (if (not (holding-on-to-guest))
         (find-and-take-arm-of-guest))
</pre>
   <p>We want to do the same thing with a buffer—if we do not have the
buffer itself, we want to get it.

   </p>
<p>Using a predicate called <code>bufferp</code> that tells us whether we have a
buffer (rather than its name), we can write the code like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (if (not (bufferp buffer))              ; <span class="roman">if-part</span>
         (setq buffer (get-buffer buffer)))  ; <span class="roman">then-part</span>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here, the true-or-false-test of the <code>if</code> expression is
<code>(not (bufferp buffer))</code><!-- /@w -->; and the then-part is the expression
<code>(setq buffer (get-buffer buffer))</code><!-- /@w -->.

   </p>
<p>In the test, the function <code>bufferp</code> returns true if its argument is
a buffer—but false if its argument is the name of the buffer.  (The
last character of the function name <code>bufferp</code> is the character
`<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>'; as we saw earlier, such use of `<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>' is a convention that
indicates that the function is a predicate, which is a term that means
that the function will determine whether some property is true or false. 
See <a href="#Wrong-Type-of-Argument">Using the Wrong Type Object as an Argument</a>.)

   </p>
<p>The function <code>not</code> precedes the expression <code>(bufferp buffer)</code>,
so the true-or-false-test looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (not (bufferp buffer))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><code>not</code> is a function that returns true if its argument is false
and false if its argument is true.  So if <code>(bufferp buffer)</code>
returns true, the <code>not</code> expression returns false and vice versa.

   </p>
<p>Using this test, the <code>if</code> expression works as follows: when the
value of the variable <code>buffer</code> is actually a buffer rather than
its name, the true-or-false-test returns false and the <code>if</code>
expression does not evaluate the then-part.  This is fine, since we do
not need to do anything to the variable <code>buffer</code> if it really is
a buffer.

   </p>
<p>On the other hand, when the value of <code>buffer</code> is not a buffer
itself, but the name of a buffer, the true-or-false-test returns true
and the then-part of the expression is evaluated.  In this case, the
then-part is <code>(setq buffer (get-buffer buffer))</code>.  This
expression uses the <code>get-buffer</code> function to return an actual
buffer itself, given its name.  The <code>setq</code> then sets the variable
<code>buffer</code> to the value of the buffer itself, replacing its previous
value (which was the name of the buffer).

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Insert-or"></a></div>

<h4 class="subsection">5.2.4 The <code>or</code> in the Body</h4>

<p>The purpose of the <code>or</code> expression in the <code>insert-buffer</code>
function is to ensure that the argument <code>buffer</code> is bound to a
buffer and not just to the name of a buffer.  The previous section shows
how the job could have been done using an <code>if</code> expression. 
However, the <code>insert-buffer</code> function actually uses <code>or</code>. 
To understand this, it is necessary to understand how <code>or</code> works.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-or-158"></a>An <code>or</code> function can have any number of arguments.  It evaluates
each argument in turn and returns the value of the first of its
arguments that is not <code>nil</code>.  Also, and this is a crucial feature
of <code>or</code>, it does not evaluate any subsequent arguments after
returning the first non-<code>nil</code> value.

   </p>
<p>The <code>or</code> expression looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (or (bufferp buffer)
         (setq buffer (get-buffer buffer)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The first argument to <code>or</code> is the expression <code>(bufferp buffer)</code>. 
This expression returns true (a non-<code>nil</code> value) if the buffer is
actually a buffer, and not just the name of a buffer.  In the <code>or</code>
expression, if this is the case, the <code>or</code> expression returns this
true value and does not evaluate the next expression—and this is fine
with us, since we do not want to do anything to the value of
<code>buffer</code> if it really is a buffer.

   </p>
<p>On the other hand, if the value of <code>(bufferp buffer)</code> is <code>nil</code>,
which it will be if the value of <code>buffer</code> is the name of a buffer,
the Lisp interpreter evaluates the next element of the <code>or</code>
expression.  This is the expression <code>(setq buffer (get-buffer
buffer))</code>.  This expression returns a non-<code>nil</code> value, which
is the value to which it sets the variable <code>buffer</code>—and this
value is a buffer itself, not the name of a buffer.

   </p>
<p>The result of all this is that the symbol <code>buffer</code> is always
bound to a buffer itself rather than to the name of a buffer.  All
this is necessary because the <code>set-buffer</code> function in a
following line only works with a buffer itself, not with the name to a
buffer.

   </p>
<p>Incidentally, using <code>or</code>, the situation with the usher would be
written like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (or (holding-on-to-guest) (find-and-take-arm-of-guest))
</pre>
   <div class="node"><a name="Insert-let"></a></div>

<h4 class="subsection">5.2.5 The <code>let</code> Expression in <code>insert-buffer</code>
</h4>

<p>After ensuring that the variable <code>buffer</code> refers to a buffer itself
and not just to the name of a buffer, the <code>insert-buffer function</code>
continues with a <code>let</code> expression.  This specifies three local
variables, <code>start</code>, <code>end</code>, and <code>newmark</code> and binds them
to the initial value <code>nil</code>.  These variables are used inside the
remainder of the <code>let</code> and temporarily hide any other occurrence of
variables of the same name in Emacs until the end of the <code>let</code>.

   </p>
<p>The body of the <code>let</code> contains two <code>save-excursion</code>
expressions.  First, we will look at the inner <code>save-excursion</code>
expression in detail.  The expression looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (save-excursion
       (set-buffer buffer)
       (setq start (point-min) end (point-max)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The expression <code>(set-buffer buffer)</code> changes Emacs's attention
from the current buffer to the one from which the text will copied. 
In that buffer, the variables <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> are set to
the beginning and end of the buffer, using the commands
<code>point-min</code> and <code>point-max</code>.  Note that we have here an
illustration of how <code>setq</code> is able to set two variables in the
same expression.  The first argument of <code>setq</code> is set to the
value of its second, and its third argument is set to the value of its
fourth.

   </p>
<p>After the body of the inner <code>save-excursion</code> is evaluated, the
<code>save-excursion</code> restores the original buffer, but <code>start</code> and
<code>end</code> remain set to the values of the beginning and end of the
buffer from which the text will be copied.

   </p>
<p>The outer <code>save-excursion</code> expression looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (save-excursion
       (<var>inner-</var><code>save-excursion</code><var>-expression</var>
          (<var>go-to-new-buffer-and-set-</var><code>start</code><var>-and-</var><code>end</code>)
       (insert-buffer-substring buffer start end)
       (setq newmark (point)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The <code>insert-buffer-substring</code> function copies the text
<em>into</em> the current buffer <em>from</em> the region indicated by
<code>start</code> and <code>end</code> in <code>buffer</code>.  Since the whole of the
second buffer lies between <code>start</code> and <code>end</code>, the whole of
the second buffer is copied into the buffer you are editing.  Next,
the value of point, which will be at the end of the inserted text, is
recorded in the variable <code>newmark</code>.

   </p>
<p>After the body of the outer <code>save-excursion</code> is evaluated, point
is relocated to its original place.

   </p>
<p>However, it is convenient to locate a mark at the end of the newly
inserted text and locate point at its beginning.  The <code>newmark</code>
variable records the end of the inserted text.  In the last line of
the <code>let</code> expression, the <code>(push-mark newmark)</code> expression
function sets a mark to this location.  (The previous location of the
mark is still accessible; it is recorded on the mark ring and you can
go back to it with <kbd>C-u C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>.)  Meanwhile, point is
located at the beginning of the inserted text, which is where it was
before you called the insert function, the position of which was saved
by the first <code>save-excursion</code>.

   </p>
<p>The whole <code>let</code> expression looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (let (start end newmark)
       (save-excursion
         (save-excursion
           (set-buffer buffer)
           (setq start (point-min) end (point-max)))
         (insert-buffer-substring buffer start end)
         (setq newmark (point)))
       (push-mark newmark))
</pre>
   <p>Like the <code>append-to-buffer</code> function, the <code>insert-buffer</code>
function uses <code>let</code>, <code>save-excursion</code>, and
<code>set-buffer</code>.  In addition, the function illustrates one way to
use <code>or</code>.  All these functions are building blocks that we will
find and use again and again.

          (insert-buffer-substring (get-buffer buffer))

        nil
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">except, and this is what confuses novices, very important work is done
inside the <code>push-mark</code> expression.

   </p>
<p>The <code>get-buffer</code> function returns a buffer with the name
provided.  You will note that the function is <em>not</em> called
<code>get-buffer-create</code>; it does not create a buffer if one does not
already exist.  The buffer returned by <code>get-buffer</code>, an existing
buffer, is passed to <code>insert-buffer-substring</code>, which inserts the
whole of the buffer (since you did not specify anything else).

   </p>
<p>The location into which the buffer is inserted is recorded by
<code>push-mark</code>.  Then the function returns <code>nil</code>, the value of
its last command.  Put another way, the <code>insert-buffer</code> function
exists only to produce a side effect, inserting another buffer, not to
return any value.

<h3 class="section">5.3 Complete Definition of <code>beginning-of-buffer</code>
</h3>

<p><a name="index-beginning_002dof_002dbuffer-161"></a>
The basic structure of the <code>beginning-of-buffer</code> function has
already been discussed.  (See <a href="#simplified_002dbeginning_002dof_002dbuffer">A Simplified <code>beginning-of-buffer</code> Definition</a>.) 
This section describes the complex part of the definition.

   </p>
<p>As previously described, when invoked without an argument,
<code>beginning-of-buffer</code> moves the cursor to the beginning of the
buffer (in truth, the beginning of the accessible portion of the
buffer), leaving the mark at the previous position.  However, when the
command is invoked with a number between one and ten, the function
considers that number to be a fraction of the length of the buffer,
measured in tenths, and Emacs moves the cursor that fraction of the
way from the beginning of the buffer.  Thus, you can either call this
function with the key command <kbd>M-&lt;</kbd>, which will move the cursor to
the beginning of the buffer, or with a key command such as <kbd>C-u 7
M-&lt;</kbd> which will move the cursor to a point 70% of the way through the
buffer.  If a number bigger than ten is used for the argument, it
moves to the end of the buffer.

   </p>
<p>The <code>beginning-of-buffer</code> function can be called with or without an
argument.  The use of the argument is optional.

<div class="node"><a name="Optional-Arguments"></a></div>

<h4 class="subsection">5.3.1 Optional Arguments</h4>

<p>Unless told otherwise, Lisp expects that a function with an argument in
its function definition will be called with a value for that argument. 
If that does not happen, you get an error and a message that says
`<samp><span class="samp">Wrong number of arguments</span></samp>'.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-Optional-arguments-162"></a><a name="index-Keyword-163"></a><a name="index-optional-164"></a>However, optional arguments are a feature of Lisp: a particular
<dfn>keyword</dfn> is used to tell the Lisp interpreter that an argument is
optional.  The keyword is <code>&amp;optional</code>.  (The `<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>' in front of
`<samp><span class="samp">optional</span></samp>' is part of the keyword.)  In a function definition, if
an argument follows the keyword <code>&amp;optional</code>, no value need be
passed to that argument when the function is called.

   </p>
<p>The first line of the function definition of <code>beginning-of-buffer</code>
therefore looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun beginning-of-buffer (&amp;optional arg)
</pre>
   <p>In outline, the whole function looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun beginning-of-buffer (&amp;optional arg)
       "<var>documentation</var>..."
       (interactive "P")
       (or (<var>is-the-argument-a-cons-cell</var> arg)
           (and <var>are-both-transient-mark-mode-and-mark-active-true</var>)
           (push-mark))
       (let (<var>determine-size-and-set-it</var>)
       (goto-char
         (<var>if-there-is-an-argument</var>
             <var>figure-out-where-to-go</var>
           <var>else-go-to</var>
           (point-min))))
        <var>do-nicety</var>
</pre>
   <p>The function is similar to the <code>simplified-beginning-of-buffer</code>
function except that the <code>interactive</code> expression has <code>"P"</code>
as an argument and the <code>goto-char</code> function is followed by an
if-then-else expression that figures out where to put the cursor if
there is an argument that is not a cons cell.

   </p>
<p>(Since I do not explain a cons cell for many more chapters, please
consider ignoring the function <code>consp</code>.  See <a href="#List-Implementation">How Lists are Implemented</a>, and <a href="elisp.html#Cons-Cell-Type">Cons Cell and List Types</a>.)

   </p>
<p>The <code>"P"</code> in the <code>interactive</code> expression tells Emacs to
pass a prefix argument, if there is one, to the function in raw form. 
A prefix argument is made by typing the &lt;META&gt; key followed by a
number, or by typing <kbd>C-u</kbd> and then a number.  (If you don't type
a number, <kbd>C-u</kbd> defaults to a cons cell with a 4.  A lowercase
<code>"p"</code> in the <code>interactive</code> expression causes the function to
convert a prefix arg to a number.)

   </p>
<p>The true-or-false-test of the <code>if</code> expression looks complex, but
it is not: it checks whether <code>arg</code> has a value that is not
<code>nil</code> and whether it is a cons cell.  (That is what <code>consp</code>
does; it checks whether its argument is a cons cell.)  If <code>arg</code>
has a value that is not <code>nil</code> (and is not a cons cell), which
will be the case if <code>beginning-of-buffer</code> is called with a
numeric argument, then this true-or-false-test will return true and
the then-part of the <code>if</code> expression will be evaluated.  On the
other hand, if <code>beginning-of-buffer</code> is not called with an
argument, the value of <code>arg</code> will be <code>nil</code> and the else-part
of the <code>if</code> expression will be evaluated.  The else-part is
simply <code>point-min</code>, and when this is the outcome, the whole
<code>goto-char</code> expression is <code>(goto-char (point-min))</code>, which
is how we saw the <code>beginning-of-buffer</code> function in its
simplified form.

<h4 class="subsection">5.3.2 <code>beginning-of-buffer</code> with an Argument</h4>

<p>When <code>beginning-of-buffer</code> is called with an argument, an
expression is evaluated which calculates what value to pass to
<code>goto-char</code>.  This expression is rather complicated at first sight. 
It includes an inner <code>if</code> expression and much arithmetic.  It looks
like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (if (&gt; (buffer-size) 10000)
         ;; <span class="roman">Avoid overflow for large buffer sizes!</span>

<h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">Disentangle <code>beginning-of-buffer</code>
</h5>

   <p>Like other complex-looking expressions, the conditional expression
within <code>beginning-of-buffer</code> can be disentangled by looking at it
as parts of a template, in this case, the template for an if-then-else
expression.  In skeletal form, the expression looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (if (<var>buffer-is-large</var>
         <var>divide-buffer-size-by-10-and-multiply-by-arg</var>
       <var>else-use-alternate-calculation</var>
</pre>
   <p>The true-or-false-test of this inner <code>if</code> expression checks the
size of the buffer.  The reason for this is that the old version 18
Emacs used numbers that are no bigger than eight million or so and in
the computation that followed, the programmer feared that Emacs might
try to use over-large numbers if the buffer were large.  The term
“overflow”, mentioned in the comment, means numbers that are over
large.  More recent versions of Emacs use larger numbers, but this
code has not been touched, if only because people now look at buffers
that are far, far larger than ever before.

   </p>
<p>There are two cases:  if the buffer is large and if it is not.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Large-buffer-case"></a></div>

<h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">What happens in a large buffer</h5>

<p>In <code>beginning-of-buffer</code>, the inner <code>if</code> expression tests
whether the size of the buffer is greater than 10,000 characters.  To do
this, it uses the <code>&gt;</code> function and the computation of <code>size</code>
that comes from the let expression.

   </p>
<p>In the old days, the function <code>buffer-size</code> was used.  Not only
was that function called several times, it gave the size of the whole
buffer, not the accessible part.  The computation makes much more
sense when it handles just the accessible part.  (See <a href="#Narrowing-_0026-Widening">Narrowing and Widening</a>, for more information on focusing
attention to an accessible part.)

<p>The line looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (if (&gt; size 10000)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">When the buffer is large, the then-part of the <code>if</code> expression is
evaluated.  It reads like this (after formatting for easy reading):

   <p class="noindent">This expression is a multiplication, with two arguments to the function

   </p>
<p>The first argument is <code>(prefix-numeric-value arg)</code>.  When

passed to the function as its argument is passed a <dfn>raw prefix
argument</dfn>, and not a number.  (It is a number in a list.)  To perform
the arithmetic, a conversion is necessary, and
<code>prefix-numeric-value</code> does the job.

the numeric value by ten—the numeric value of the size of the

how many characters make up one tenth of the buffer size.  (In Lisp,
<code>/</code> is used for division, just as <code>*</code> is used for
multiplication.)

   </p>
<p>In the multiplication expression as a whole, this amount is multiplied
by the value of the prefix argument—the multiplication looks like this:

<h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">What happens in a small buffer</h5>

<p>If the buffer contains fewer than 10,000 characters, a slightly
different computation is performed.  You might think this is not
necessary, since the first computation could do the job.  However, in
a small buffer, the first method may not put the cursor on exactly the
desired line; the second method does a better job.

   </p>
<p>The code looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     (/ (+ 10 (* size (prefix-numeric-value arg))) 10))

</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Looking at parentheses, we see that the innermost operation is
<code>(prefix-numeric-value arg)</code>, which converts the raw argument to
a number.  In the following expression, this number is multiplied by
the size of the accessible portion of the buffer:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (* size (prefix-numeric-value arg))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This multiplication creates a number that may be larger than the size of
the buffer—seven times larger if the argument is 7, for example.  Ten
is then added to this number and finally the large number is divided by
ten to provide a value that is one character larger than the percentage
position in the buffer.

   </p>
<p>The number that results from all this is passed to <code>goto-char</code> and
the cursor is moved to that point.

<p>In the documentation string, there is reference to an expression:

<pre class="smallexample">     \\[universal-argument]

   <p class="noindent">A `<samp><span class="samp">\\</span></samp>' is used before the first square bracket of this

   </p>
<p>Finally, the last line of the <code>beginning-of-buffer</code> command says
to move point to the beginning of the next line if the command is
invoked with an argument:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (if (and arg (not (consp arg))) (forward-line 1))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This puts the cursor at the beginning of the first line after the
appropriate tenths position in the buffer.  This is a flourish that
means that the cursor is always located <em>at least</em> the requested
tenths of the way through the buffer, which is a nicety that is,
perhaps, not necessary, but which, if it did not occur, would be sure
to draw complaints.  (The <code>(not (consp arg))</code> portion is so that
if you specify the command with a <kbd>C-u</kbd>, but without a number,
that is to say, if the raw prefix argument is simply a cons cell,
the command does not put you at the beginning of the second line.)

<p><a name="index-Focusing-attention-_0028narrowing_0029-167"></a><a name="index-Narrowing-168"></a><a name="index-Widening-169"></a>
Narrowing is a feature of Emacs that makes it possible for you to focus
on a specific part of a buffer, and work without accidentally changing
other parts.  Narrowing is normally disabled since it can confuse
novices.

<div class="node"><a name="Narrowing-advantages"></a></div>

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">The Advantages of Narrowing</h3>

   <p>With narrowing, the rest of a buffer is made invisible, as if it weren't
there.  This is an advantage if, for example, you want to replace a word
in one part of a buffer but not in another: you narrow to the part you want
and the replacement is carried out only in that section, not in the rest
of the buffer.  Searches will only work within a narrowed region, not
outside of one, so if you are fixing a part of a document, you can keep
yourself from accidentally finding parts you do not need to fix by
narrowing just to the region you want. 
(The key binding for <code>narrow-to-region</code> is <kbd>C-x n n</kbd>.)

   </p>
<p>However, narrowing does make the rest of the buffer invisible, which
can scare people who inadvertently invoke narrowing and think they
have deleted a part of their file.  Moreover, the <code>undo</code> command
(which is usually bound to <kbd>C-x u</kbd>) does not turn off narrowing
(nor should it), so people can become quite desperate if they do not
know that they can return the rest of a buffer to visibility with the
<code>widen</code> command. 
(The key binding for <code>widen</code> is <kbd>C-x n w</kbd>.)

   </p>
<p>Narrowing is just as useful to the Lisp interpreter as to a human. 
Often, an Emacs Lisp function is designed to work on just part of a
buffer; or conversely, an Emacs Lisp function needs to work on all of a
buffer that has been narrowed.  The <code>what-line</code> function, for
example, removes the narrowing from a buffer, if it has any narrowing
and when it has finished its job, restores the narrowing to what it was. 
On the other hand, the <code>count-lines</code> function
uses narrowing to restrict itself to just that portion
of the buffer in which it is interested and then restores the previous
situation.

<h3 class="section">6.1 The <code>save-restriction</code> Special Form</h3>

<p><a name="index-save_002drestriction-170"></a>
In Emacs Lisp, you can use the <code>save-restriction</code> special form to
keep track of whatever narrowing is in effect, if any.  When the Lisp
interpreter meets with <code>save-restriction</code>, it executes the code
in the body of the <code>save-restriction</code> expression, and then undoes
any changes to narrowing that the code caused.  If, for example, the
buffer is narrowed and the code that follows <code>save-restriction</code>
gets rid of the narrowing, <code>save-restriction</code> returns the buffer
to its narrowed region afterwards.  In the <code>what-line</code> command,
any narrowing the buffer may have is undone by the <code>widen</code>
command that immediately follows the <code>save-restriction</code> command. 
Any original narrowing is restored just before the completion of the
function.

   </p>
<p>The template for a <code>save-restriction</code> expression is simple:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (save-restriction
       <var>body</var>... )
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The body of the <code>save-restriction</code> is one or more expressions that
will be evaluated in sequence by the Lisp interpreter.

   </p>
<p>Finally, a point to note: when you use both <code>save-excursion</code> and
<code>save-restriction</code>, one right after the other, you should use
<code>save-excursion</code> outermost.  If you write them in reverse order,
you may fail to record narrowing in the buffer to which Emacs switches
after calling <code>save-excursion</code>.  Thus, when written together,
<code>save-excursion</code> and <code>save-restriction</code> should be written
like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (save-excursion
       (save-restriction
         <var>body</var>...))
</pre>
   <p>In other circumstances, when not written together, the
<code>save-excursion</code> and <code>save-restriction</code> special forms must
be written in the order appropriate to the function.

   </p>
<p>For example,

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">       (save-restriction
         (widen)
         (save-excursion
         <var>body</var>...))
</pre>
   <div class="node">
<a name="what-line"></a><a name="what_002dline"></a>
</div>

<h3 class="section">6.2 <code>what-line</code>
</h3>

<p><a name="index-what_002dline-171"></a><a name="index-Widening_002c-example-of-172"></a>
The <code>what-line</code> command tells you the number of the line in which
the cursor is located.  The function illustrates the use of the
<code>save-restriction</code> and <code>save-excursion</code> commands.  Here is the
original text of the function:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun what-line ()
       "Print the current line number (in the buffer) of point."
       (interactive)
       (save-restriction
         (widen)
         (save-excursion
           (beginning-of-line)
           (message "Line %d"
                    (1+ (count-lines 1 (point)))))))
</pre>
   <p>(In recent versions of GNU Emacs, the <code>what-line</code> function has
been expanded to tell you your line number in a narrowed buffer as
well as your line number in a widened buffer.  The recent version is
more complex than the version shown here.  If you feel adventurous,
you might want to look at it after figuring out how this version
works.  You will probably need to use <kbd>C-h f</kbd>
(<code>describe-function</code>).  The newer version uses a conditional to
determine whether the buffer has been narrowed.

   </p>
<p>(Also, it uses <code>line-number-at-pos</code>, which among other simple
expressions, such as <code>(goto-char (point-min))</code>, moves point to
the beginning of the current line with <code>(forward-line 0)</code> rather
than <code>beginning-of-line</code>.)

   </p>
<p>The <code>what-line</code> function as shown here has a documentation line
and is interactive, as you would expect.  The next two lines use the
functions <code>save-restriction</code> and <code>widen</code>.

   </p>
<p>The <code>save-restriction</code> special form notes whatever narrowing is in
effect, if any, in the current buffer and restores that narrowing after
the code in the body of the <code>save-restriction</code> has been evaluated.

   </p>
<p>The <code>save-restriction</code> special form is followed by <code>widen</code>. 
This function undoes any narrowing the current buffer may have had
when <code>what-line</code> was called.  (The narrowing that was there is
the narrowing that <code>save-restriction</code> remembers.)  This widening
makes it possible for the line counting commands to count from the
beginning of the buffer.  Otherwise, they would have been limited to
counting within the accessible region.  Any original narrowing is
restored just before the completion of the function by the
<code>save-restriction</code> special form.

   </p>
<p>The call to <code>widen</code> is followed by <code>save-excursion</code>, which
saves the location of the cursor (i.e., of point), and
restores it after the code in the body of the <code>save-excursion</code>
uses the <code>beginning-of-line</code> function to move point.

   </p>
<p>(Note that the <code>(widen)</code> expression comes between the
<code>save-restriction</code> and <code>save-excursion</code> special forms.  When
you write the two <code>save- ...</code> expressions in sequence, write
<code>save-excursion</code> outermost.)

   </p>
<p>The last two lines of the <code>what-line</code> function are functions to
count the number of lines in the buffer and then print the number in the
echo area.

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (message "Line %d"
              (1+ (count-lines 1 (point)))))))
</pre>
   <p>The <code>message</code> function prints a one-line message at the bottom of
the Emacs screen.  The first argument is inside of quotation marks and
is printed as a string of characters.  However, it may contain a
`<samp><span class="samp">%d</span></samp>' expression to print a following argument.  `<samp><span class="samp">%d</span></samp>' prints
the argument as a decimal, so the message will say something such as
`<samp><span class="samp">Line 243</span></samp>'.

   </p>
<p>The number that is printed in place of the `<samp><span class="samp">%d</span></samp>' is computed by the
last line of the function:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (1+ (count-lines 1 (point)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">What this does is count the lines from the first position of the
buffer, indicated by the <code>1</code>, up to <code>(point)</code>, and then add
one to that number.  (The <code>1+</code> function adds one to its
argument.)  We add one to it because line 2 has only one line before
it, and <code>count-lines</code> counts only the lines <em>before</em> the
current line.

   </p>
<p>After <code>count-lines</code> has done its job, and the message has been
printed in the echo area, the <code>save-excursion</code> restores point to
its original position; and <code>save-restriction</code> restores
the original narrowing, if any.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Strange Names</h3>

   <p>The name of the <code>cons</code> function is not unreasonable: it is an
abbreviation of the word “construct”.  The origins of the names for
<code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code>, on the other hand, are esoteric: <code>car</code>
is an acronym from the phrase “Contents of the Address part of the
Register”; and <code>cdr</code> (pronounced “could-er”) is an acronym from
the phrase “Contents of the Decrement part of the Register”.  These
phrases refer to specific pieces of hardware on the very early
computer on which the original Lisp was developed.  Besides being
obsolete, the phrases have been completely irrelevant for more than 25
years to anyone thinking about Lisp.  Nonetheless, although a few
brave scholars have begun to use more reasonable names for these
functions, the old terms are still in use.  In particular, since the
terms are used in the Emacs Lisp source code, we will use them in this
introduction.

<pre class="smallexample">     (car '(rose violet daisy buttercup))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">After evaluating the expression, <code>rose</code> will appear in the echo
area.

   </p>
<p>Clearly, a more reasonable name for the <code>car</code> function would be
<code>first</code> and this is often suggested.

   </p>
<p><code>car</code> does not remove the first item from the list; it only reports
what it is.  After <code>car</code> has been applied to a list, the list is
still the same as it was.  In the jargon, <code>car</code> is
“non-destructive”.  This feature turns out to be important.

   </p>
<p>The <span class="sc">cdr</span> of a list is the rest of the list, that is, the
<code>cdr</code> function returns the part of the list that follows the
first item.  Thus, while the <span class="sc">car</span> of the list <code>'(rose violet
daisy buttercup)</code> is <code>rose</code>, the rest of the list, the value
returned by the <code>cdr</code> function, is <code>(violet daisy
buttercup)</code>.

   </p>
<p>You can see this by evaluating the following in the usual way:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (cdr '(rose violet daisy buttercup))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">When you evaluate this, <code>(violet daisy buttercup)</code> will appear in
the echo area.

   </p>
<p>Like <code>car</code>, <code>cdr</code> does not remove any elements from the
list—it just returns a report of what the second and subsequent
elements are.

   </p>
<p>Incidentally, in the example, the list of flowers is quoted.  If it were
not, the Lisp interpreter would try to evaluate the list by calling
<code>rose</code> as a function.  In this example, we do not want to do that.

   </p>
<p>Clearly, a more reasonable name for <code>cdr</code> would be <code>rest</code>.

   </p>
<p>(There is a lesson here: when you name new functions, consider very
carefully what you are doing, since you may be stuck with the names
for far longer than you expect.  The reason this document perpetuates
these names is that the Emacs Lisp source code uses them, and if I did
not use them, you would have a hard time reading the code; but do,
please, try to avoid using these terms yourself.  The people who come
after you will be grateful to you.)

   </p>
<p>When <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> are applied to a list made up of symbols,
such as the list <code>(pine fir oak maple)</code>, the element of the list
returned by the function <code>car</code> is the symbol <code>pine</code> without
any parentheses around it.  <code>pine</code> is the first element in the
list.  However, the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of the list is a list itself, <code>(fir
oak maple)</code>, as you can see by evaluating the following expressions in
the usual way:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (car '(pine fir oak maple))
     
     (cdr '(pine fir oak maple))
</pre>
   <p>On the other hand, in a list of lists, the first element is itself a
list.  <code>car</code> returns this first element as a list.  For example,
the following list contains three sub-lists, a list of carnivores, a
list of herbivores and a list of sea mammals:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (car '((lion tiger cheetah)
            (gazelle antelope zebra)
            (whale dolphin seal)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this example, the first element or <span class="sc">car</span> of the list is the list of
carnivores, <code>(lion tiger cheetah)</code>, and the rest of the list is
<code>((gazelle antelope zebra) (whale dolphin seal))</code>.

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (cdr '((lion tiger cheetah)
            (gazelle antelope zebra)
            (whale dolphin seal)))
</pre>
   <p>It is worth saying again that <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> are
non-destructive—that is, they do not modify or change lists to which
they are applied.  This is very important for how they are used.

   </p>
<p>Also, in the first chapter, in the discussion about atoms, I said that
in Lisp, certain kinds of atom, such as an array, can be separated
into parts; but the mechanism for doing this is different from the
mechanism for splitting a list.  As far as Lisp is concerned, the
atoms of a list are unsplittable.  (See <a href="#Lisp-Atoms">Lisp Atoms</a>.)  The
<code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> functions are used for splitting lists and
are considered fundamental to Lisp.  Since they cannot split or gain
access to the parts of an array, an array is considered an atom. 
Conversely, the other fundamental function, <code>cons</code>, can put
together or construct a list, but not an array.  (Arrays are handled
by array-specific functions.  See <a href="elisp.html#Arrays">Arrays</a>.)

<h3 class="section">7.2 <code>cons</code>
</h3>

<p><a name="index-cons_002c-_0040r_007bintroduced_007d-176"></a>
The <code>cons</code> function constructs lists; it is the inverse of
<code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code>.  For example, <code>cons</code> can be used to make
a four element list from the three element list, <code>(fir oak maple)</code>:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (cons 'pine '(fir oak maple))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">After evaluating this list, you will see

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (pine fir oak maple)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">appear in the echo area.  <code>cons</code> causes the creation of a new
list in which the element is followed by the elements of the original
list.

   </p>
<p>We often say that <code>cons</code> puts a new element at the beginning of
a list, or that it attaches or pushes elements onto the list, but this
phrasing can be misleading, since <code>cons</code> does not change an
existing list, but creates a new one.

   </p>
<p>Like <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code>, <code>cons</code> is non-destructive.

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Build a list</h4>

   <p><code>cons</code> must have a list to attach to.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-9" name="fnd-9"><sup>9</sup></a>  You
cannot start from absolutely nothing.  If you are building a list, you
need to provide at least an empty list at the beginning.  Here is a
series of <code>cons</code> expressions that build up a list of flowers.  If
you are reading this in Info in GNU Emacs, you can evaluate each of
the expressions in the usual way; the value is printed in this text
after `<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>', which you may read as “evaluates to”.

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (cons 'buttercup ())
          =&gt; (buttercup)
     
     (cons 'daisy '(buttercup))
          =&gt; (daisy buttercup)
     
     (cons 'violet '(daisy buttercup))
          =&gt; (violet daisy buttercup)
     
     (cons 'rose '(violet daisy buttercup))
          =&gt; (rose violet daisy buttercup)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In the first example, the empty list is shown as <code>()</code> and a list
made up of <code>buttercup</code> followed by the empty list is constructed. 
As you can see, the empty list is not shown in the list that was
constructed.  All that you see is <code>(buttercup)</code>.  The empty list is
not counted as an element of a list because there is nothing in an empty
list.  Generally speaking, an empty list is invisible.

   </p>
<p>The second example, <code>(cons 'daisy '(buttercup))</code> constructs a new,
two element list by putting <code>daisy</code> in front of <code>buttercup</code>;
and the third example constructs a three element list by putting
<code>violet</code> in front of <code>daisy</code> and <code>buttercup</code>.

<div class="node"><a name="length"></a></div>

<h4 class="subsection">7.2.1 Find the Length of a List: <code>length</code>
</h4>

<p><a name="index-length-177"></a>
You can find out how many elements there are in a list by using the Lisp
function <code>length</code>, as in the following examples:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (length '(buttercup))
          =&gt; 1
     
     (length '(daisy buttercup))
          =&gt; 2
     
     (length (cons 'violet '(daisy buttercup)))
          =&gt; 3
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In the third example, the <code>cons</code> function is used to construct a
three element list which is then passed to the <code>length</code> function as
its argument.

   </p>
<p>We can also use <code>length</code> to count the number of elements in an
empty list:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (length ())
          =&gt; 0
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">As you would expect, the number of elements in an empty list is zero.

   </p>
<p>An interesting experiment is to find out what happens if you try to find
the length of no list at all; that is, if you try to call <code>length</code>
without giving it an argument, not even an empty list:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (length )
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">What you see, if you evaluate this, is the error message

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     Lisp error: (wrong-number-of-arguments length 0)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This means that the function receives the wrong number of
arguments, zero, when it expects some other number of arguments.  In
this case, one argument is expected, the argument being a list whose
length the function is measuring.  (Note that <em>one</em> list is
<em>one</em> argument, even if the list has many elements inside it.)

   </p>
<p>The part of the error message that says `<samp><span class="samp">length</span></samp>' is the name of
the function.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="nthcdr"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">7.3 <code>nthcdr</code>
</h3>

<p><a name="index-nthcdr-178"></a>
The <code>nthcdr</code> function is associated with the <code>cdr</code> function. 
What it does is take the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of a list repeatedly.

   </p>
<p>If you take the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of the list <code>(pine fir
oak maple)</code>, you will be returned the list <code>(fir oak maple)</code>.  If you
repeat this on what was returned, you will be returned the list
<code>(oak maple)</code>.  (Of course, repeated <span class="sc">cdr</span>ing on the original
list will just give you the original <span class="sc">cdr</span> since the function does
not change the list.  You need to evaluate the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of the
<span class="sc">cdr</span> and so on.)  If you continue this, eventually you will be
returned an empty list, which in this case, instead of being shown as
<code>()</code> is shown as <code>nil</code>.

   </p>
<p>For review, here is a series of repeated <span class="sc">cdr</span>s, the text following
the `<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>' shows what is returned.

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (cdr '(pine fir oak maple))
          =&gt;(fir oak maple)
     
     (cdr '(fir oak maple))
          =&gt; (oak maple)
     
     (cdr '(oak maple))
          =&gt;(maple)
     
     (cdr '(maple))
          =&gt; nil
     
     (cdr 'nil)
          =&gt; nil
     
     (cdr ())
          =&gt; nil
</pre>
   <p>You can also do several <span class="sc">cdr</span>s without printing the values in
between, like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (cdr (cdr '(pine fir oak maple)))
          =&gt; (oak maple)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this example, the Lisp interpreter evaluates the innermost list first. 
The innermost list is quoted, so it just passes the list as it is to the
innermost <code>cdr</code>.  This <code>cdr</code> passes a list made up of the
second and subsequent elements of the list to the outermost <code>cdr</code>,
which produces a list composed of the third and subsequent elements of
the original list.  In this example, the <code>cdr</code> function is repeated
and returns a list that consists of the original list without its
first two elements.

   </p>
<p>The <code>nthcdr</code> function does the same as repeating the call to
<code>cdr</code>.  In the following example, the argument 2 is passed to the
function <code>nthcdr</code>, along with the list, and the value returned is
the list without its first two items, which is exactly the same
as repeating <code>cdr</code> twice on the list:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (nthcdr 2 '(pine fir oak maple))
          =&gt; (oak maple)
</pre>
   <p>Using the original four element list, we can see what happens when
various numeric arguments are passed to <code>nthcdr</code>, including 0, 1,
and 5:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ;; <span class="roman">Leave the list as it was.</span>
     (nthcdr 0 '(pine fir oak maple))
          =&gt; (pine fir oak maple)
     
     ;; <span class="roman">Return a copy without the first element.</span>
     (nthcdr 1 '(pine fir oak maple))
          =&gt; (fir oak maple)
     
     ;; <span class="roman">Return a copy of the list without three elements.</span>
     (nthcdr 3 '(pine fir oak maple))
          =&gt; (maple)
     
     ;; <span class="roman">Return a copy lacking all four elements.</span>
     (nthcdr 4 '(pine fir oak maple))
          =&gt; nil
     
     ;; <span class="roman">Return a copy lacking all elements.</span>
     (nthcdr 5 '(pine fir oak maple))
          =&gt; nil
</pre>
   <div class="node"><a name="nth"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">7.4 <code>nth</code>
</h3>

<p><a name="index-nth-179"></a>
The <code>nthcdr</code> function takes the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of a list repeatedly. 
The <code>nth</code> function takes the <span class="sc">car</span> of the result returned by
<code>nthcdr</code>.  It returns the Nth element of the list.

   </p>
<p>Thus, if it were not defined in C for speed, the definition of
<code>nth</code> would be:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun nth (n list)
       "Returns the Nth element of LIST.
     N counts from zero.  If LIST is not that long, nil is returned."
       (car (nthcdr n list)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(Originally, <code>nth</code> was defined in Emacs Lisp in <samp><span class="file">subr.el</span></samp>,
but its definition was redone in C in the 1980s.)

   </p>
<p>The <code>nth</code> function returns a single element of a list. 
This can be very convenient.

   </p>
<p>Note that the elements are numbered from zero, not one.  That is to
say, the first element of a list, its <span class="sc">car</span> is the zeroth element. 
This zero-based counting often bothers people who
are accustomed to the first element in a list being number one, which
is one-based.

   </p>
<p>For example:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (nth 0 '("one" "two" "three"))
         =&gt; "one"
     
     (nth 1 '("one" "two" "three"))
         =&gt; "two"
</pre>
   <p>It is worth mentioning that <code>nth</code>, like <code>nthcdr</code> and
<code>cdr</code>, does not change the original list—the function is
non-destructive.  This is in sharp contrast to the <code>setcar</code> and
<code>setcdr</code> functions.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="setcar"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">7.5 <code>setcar</code>
</h3>

<p><a name="index-setcar-180"></a>
As you might guess from their names, the <code>setcar</code> and <code>setcdr</code>
functions set the <span class="sc">car</span> or the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of a list to a new value. 
They actually change the original list, unlike <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code>
which leave the original list as it was.  One way to find out how this
works is to experiment.  We will start with the <code>setcar</code> function.

   </p>
<p>First, we can make a list and then set the value of a variable to the
list, using the <code>setq</code> function.  Here is a list of animals:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setq animals '(antelope giraffe lion tiger))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If you are reading this in Info inside of GNU Emacs, you can evaluate
this expression in the usual fashion, by positioning the cursor after
the expression and typing <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>.  (I'm doing this right here
as I write this.  This is one of the advantages of having the
interpreter built into the computing environment.  Incidentally, when
there is nothing on the line after the final parentheses, such as a
comment, point can be on the next line.  Thus, if your cursor is in
the first column of the next line, you do not need to move it. 
Indeed, Emacs permits any amount of white space after the final
parenthesis.)

   </p>
<p>When we evaluate the variable <code>animals</code>, we see that it is bound to
the list <code>(antelope giraffe lion tiger)</code>:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     animals
          =&gt; (antelope giraffe lion tiger)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Put another way, the variable <code>animals</code> points to the list
<code>(antelope giraffe lion tiger)</code>.

   </p>
<p>Next, evaluate the function <code>setcar</code> while passing it two
arguments, the variable <code>animals</code> and the quoted symbol
<code>hippopotamus</code>; this is done by writing the three element list
<code>(setcar animals 'hippopotamus)</code> and then evaluating it in the
usual fashion:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setcar animals 'hippopotamus)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">After evaluating this expression, evaluate the variable <code>animals</code>
again.  You will see that the list of animals has changed:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     animals
          =&gt; (hippopotamus giraffe lion tiger)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The first element on the list, <code>antelope</code> is replaced by
<code>hippopotamus</code>.

   </p>
<p>So we can see that <code>setcar</code> did not add a new element to the list
as <code>cons</code> would have; it replaced <code>antelope</code> with
<code>hippopotamus</code>; it <em>changed</em> the list.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="setcdr"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">7.6 <code>setcdr</code>
</h3>

<p><a name="index-setcdr-181"></a>
The <code>setcdr</code> function is similar to the <code>setcar</code> function,
except that the function replaces the second and subsequent elements of
a list rather than the first element.

   </p>
<p>(To see how to change the last element of a list, look ahead to
<a href="#kill_002dnew-function">The <code>kill-new</code> function</a>, which uses
the <code>nthcdr</code> and <code>setcdr</code> functions.)

   </p>
<p>To see how this works, set the value of the variable to a list of
domesticated animals by evaluating the following expression:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setq domesticated-animals '(horse cow sheep goat))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If you now evaluate the list, you will be returned the list
<code>(horse cow sheep goat)</code>:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     domesticated-animals
          =&gt; (horse cow sheep goat)
</pre>
   <p>Next, evaluate <code>setcdr</code> with two arguments, the name of the
variable which has a list as its value, and the list to which the
<span class="sc">cdr</span> of the first list will be set;

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setcdr domesticated-animals '(cat dog))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If you evaluate this expression, the list <code>(cat dog)</code> will appear
in the echo area.  This is the value returned by the function.  The
result we are interested in is the side effect, which we can see by
evaluating the variable <code>domesticated-animals</code>:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     domesticated-animals
          =&gt; (horse cat dog)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Indeed, the list is changed from <code>(horse cow sheep goat)</code> to
<code>(horse cat dog)</code>.  The <span class="sc">cdr</span> of the list is changed from
<code>(cow sheep goat)</code> to <code>(cat dog)</code>.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Storing Text in a List</h3>

   <p>When text is cut out of a buffer, it is stored on a list.  Successive
pieces of text are stored on the list successively, so the list might
look like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ("a piece of text" "previous piece")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The function <code>cons</code> can be used to create a new list from a piece
of text (an “atom”, to use the jargon) and an existing list, like
this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (cons "another piece"
           '("a piece of text" "previous piece"))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If you evaluate this expression, a list of three elements will appear in
the echo area:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ("another piece" "a piece of text" "previous piece")
</pre>
   <p>With the <code>car</code> and <code>nthcdr</code> functions, you can retrieve
whichever piece of text you want.  For example, in the following code,
<code>nthcdr 1 ...</code> returns the list with the first item removed;
and the <code>car</code> returns the first element of that remainder—the
second element of the original list:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (car (nthcdr 1 '("another piece"
                      "a piece of text"
                      "previous piece")))
          =&gt; "a piece of text"
</pre>
   <p>The actual functions in Emacs are more complex than this, of course. 
The code for cutting and retrieving text has to be written so that
Emacs can figure out which element in the list you want—the first,
second, third, or whatever.  In addition, when you get to the end of
the list, Emacs should give you the first element of the list, rather
than nothing at all.

   </p>
<p>The list that holds the pieces of text is called the <dfn>kill ring</dfn>. 
This chapter leads up to a description of the kill ring and how it is

function calls a function that invokes a function that

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">The Complete <code>zap-to-char</code> Implementation</h4>

   <p>The <code>zap-to-char</code> function removes the text in the region between
the location of the cursor (i.e., of point) up to and including the
next occurrence of a specified character.  The text that
<code>zap-to-char</code> removes is put in the kill ring; and it can be
retrieved from the kill ring by typing <kbd>C-y</kbd> (<code>yank</code>).  If
the command is given an argument, it removes text through that number
of occurrences.  Thus, if the cursor were at the beginning of this
sentence and the character were `<samp><span class="samp">s</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">Thus</span></samp>' would be
removed.  If the argument were two, `<samp><span class="samp">Thus, if the curs</span></samp>' would be
removed, up to and including the `<samp><span class="samp">s</span></samp>' in `<samp><span class="samp">cursor</span></samp>'.

   </p>
<p>If the specified character is not found, <code>zap-to-char</code> will say
“Search failed”, tell you the character you typed, and not remove
any text.

   </p>
<p>In order to determine how much text to remove, <code>zap-to-char</code> uses
a search function.  Searches are used extensively in code that
manipulates text, and we will focus attention on them as well as on the
deletion command.

   </p>
<p>Here is the complete text of the version 22 implementation of the function:

<!-- GNU Emacs 22 -->
</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun zap-to-char (arg char)
       "Kill up to and including ARG'th occurrence of CHAR.
     Case is ignored if `case-fold-search' is non-nil in the current buffer.
     Goes backward if ARG is negative; error if CHAR not found."
       (interactive "p\ncZap to char: ")
       (if (char-table-p translation-table-for-input)
           (setq char (or (aref translation-table-for-input char) char)))
       (kill-region (point) (progn
                              (search-forward (char-to-string char)
                                              nil nil arg)
                              (point))))
</pre>
   <p>The documentation is thorough.  You do need to know the jargon meaning
of the word “kill”.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-curved-quotes-189"></a><a name="index-curly-quotes-190"></a>The version 22 documentation string for <code>zap-to-char</code> uses ASCII
grave accent and apostrophe to quote a symbol, so it appears as
<tt>`case-fold-search'</tt>.  This quoting style was inspired by 1970s-era
displays in which grave accent and apostrophe were often mirror images
suitable for use as quotes.  On most modern displays this is no longer
true, and when these two ASCII characters appear in documentation
strings or diagnostic message formats, Emacs typically transliterates
them to <dfn>curved quotes</dfn> (left and right single quotation marks),
so that the abovequoted symbol appears
as <tt>‘case-fold-search’</tt>.  Source-code strings can also simply use
curved quotes directly.

<h4 class="subsection">8.1.1 The <code>interactive</code> Expression</h4>

<p>The interactive expression in the <code>zap-to-char</code> command looks like
this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (interactive "p\ncZap to char: ")
</pre>
   <p>The part within quotation marks, <code>"p\ncZap to char: "</code>, specifies
two different things.  First, and most simply, is the `<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>'. 
This part is separated from the next part by a newline, `<samp><span class="samp">\n</span></samp>'. 
The `<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>' means that the first argument to the function will be
passed the value of a <dfn>processed prefix</dfn>.  The prefix argument is
passed by typing <kbd>C-u</kbd> and a number, or <kbd>M-</kbd> and a number.  If
the function is called interactively without a prefix, 1 is passed to
this argument.

   </p>
<p>The second part of <code>"p\ncZap to char: "</code> is
`<samp><span class="samp">cZap to char:  </span></samp>'.  In this part, the lower case `<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>'
indicates that <code>interactive</code> expects a prompt and that the
argument will be a character.  The prompt follows the `<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>' and is
the string `<samp><span class="samp">Zap to char: </span></samp>' (with a space after the colon to
make it look good).

   </p>
<p>What all this does is prepare the arguments to <code>zap-to-char</code> so they
are of the right type, and give the user a prompt.

   </p>
<p>In a read-only buffer, the <code>zap-to-char</code> function copies the text
to the kill ring, but does not remove it.  The echo area displays a
message saying that the buffer is read-only.  Also, the terminal may
beep or blink at you.

<h4 class="subsection">8.1.2 The Body of <code>zap-to-char</code>
</h4>

<p>The body of the <code>zap-to-char</code> function contains the code that
kills (that is, removes) the text in the region from the current
position of the cursor up to and including the specified character.

   </p>
<p>The first part of the code looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (if (char-table-p translation-table-for-input)
         (setq char (or (aref translation-table-for-input char) char)))
     (kill-region (point) (progn
                            (search-forward (char-to-string char) nil nil arg)
                            (point)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><code>char-table-p</code> is an hitherto unseen function.  It determines
whether its argument is a character table.  When it is, it sets the
character passed to <code>zap-to-char</code> to one of them, if that
character exists, or to the character itself.  (This becomes important
for certain characters in non-European languages.  The <code>aref</code>
function extracts an element from an array.  It is an array-specific
function that is not described in this document.  See <a href="elisp.html#Arrays">Arrays</a>.)

</p>
<p class="noindent"><code>(point)</code> is the current position of the cursor.

   </p>
<p>The next part of the code is an expression using <code>progn</code>.  The body
of the <code>progn</code> consists of calls to <code>search-forward</code> and
<code>point</code>.

   </p>
<p>It is easier to understand how <code>progn</code> works after learning about
<code>search-forward</code>, so we will look at <code>search-forward</code> and
then at <code>progn</code>.

</p>
<div class="node">
<a name="search-forward"></a><a name="search_002dforward"></a>
</div>

<h4 class="subsection">8.1.3 The <code>search-forward</code> Function</h4>

<p><a name="index-search_002dforward-191"></a>
The <code>search-forward</code> function is used to locate the
zapped-for-character in <code>zap-to-char</code>.  If the search is
successful, <code>search-forward</code> leaves point immediately after the
last character in the target string.  (In <code>zap-to-char</code>, the
target string is just one character long.  <code>zap-to-char</code> uses the
function <code>char-to-string</code> to ensure that the computer treats that
character as a string.)  If the search is backwards,
<code>search-forward</code> leaves point just before the first character in
the target.  Also, <code>search-forward</code> returns <code>t</code> for true. 
(Moving point is therefore a side effect.)

   </p>
<p>In <code>zap-to-char</code>, the <code>search-forward</code> function looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (search-forward (char-to-string char) nil nil arg)
</pre>
   <p>The <code>search-forward</code> function takes four arguments:

     </p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>The first argument is the target, what is searched for.  This must be a
string, such as `<samp><span class="samp">"z"</span></samp>'.

     <p>As it happens, the argument passed to <code>zap-to-char</code> is a single
character.  Because of the way computers are built, the Lisp
interpreter may treat a single character as being different from a
string of characters.  Inside the computer, a single character has a
different electronic format than a string of one character.  (A single
character can often be recorded in the computer using exactly one
byte; but a string may be longer, and the computer needs to be ready
for this.)  Since the <code>search-forward</code> function searches for a
string, the character that the <code>zap-to-char</code> function receives as
its argument must be converted inside the computer from one format to
the other; otherwise the <code>search-forward</code> function will fail. 
The <code>char-to-string</code> function is used to make this conversion.

     </p>
</li>
<li>The second argument bounds the search; it is specified as a position in
the buffer.  In this case, the search can go to the end of the buffer,
so no bound is set and the second argument is <code>nil</code>.

     </li>
<li>The third argument tells the function what it should do if the search
fails—it can signal an error (and print a message) or it can return
<code>nil</code>.  A <code>nil</code> as the third argument causes the function to
signal an error when the search fails.

     </li>
<li>The fourth argument to <code>search-forward</code> is the repeat count—how
many occurrences of the string to look for.  This argument is optional
and if the function is called without a repeat count, this argument is
passed the value 1.  If this argument is negative, the search goes
backwards.
        </li>
</ol>

   <p>In template form, a <code>search-forward</code> expression looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (search-forward "<var>target-string</var>"
                     <var>limit-of-search</var>
                     <var>what-to-do-if-search-fails</var>
                     <var>repeat-count</var>)
</pre>
   <p>We will look at <code>progn</code> next.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="progn"></a></div>

<h4 class="subsection">8.1.4 The <code>progn</code> Special Form</h4>

<p><a name="index-progn-192"></a>
<code>progn</code> is a special form that causes each of its arguments to be
evaluated in sequence and then returns the value of the last one.  The
preceding expressions are evaluated only for the side effects they
perform.  The values produced by them are discarded.

   </p>
<p>The template for a <code>progn</code> expression is very simple:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (progn
       <var>body</var>...)
</pre>
   <p>In <code>zap-to-char</code>, the <code>progn</code> expression has to do two things:
put point in exactly the right position; and return the location of
point so that <code>kill-region</code> will know how far to kill to.

   </p>
<p>The first argument to the <code>progn</code> is <code>search-forward</code>.  When
<code>search-forward</code> finds the string, the function leaves point
immediately after the last character in the target string.  (In this
case the target string is just one character long.)  If the search is
backwards, <code>search-forward</code> leaves point just before the first
character in the target.  The movement of point is a side effect.

   </p>
<p>The second and last argument to <code>progn</code> is the expression
<code>(point)</code>.  This expression returns the value of point, which in
this case will be the location to which it has been moved by
<code>search-forward</code>.  (In the source, a line that tells the function
to go to the previous character, if it is going forward, was commented
out in 1999; I don't remember whether that feature or mis-feature was
ever a part of the distributed source.)  The value of <code>point</code> is
returned by the <code>progn</code> expression and is passed to
<code>kill-region</code> as <code>kill-region</code>'s second argument.

<h4 class="subsection">8.1.5 Summing up <code>zap-to-char</code>
</h4>

<p>Now that we have seen how <code>search-forward</code> and <code>progn</code> work,
we can see how the <code>zap-to-char</code> function works as a whole.

   </p>
<p>The first argument to <code>kill-region</code> is the position of the cursor
when the <code>zap-to-char</code> command is given—the value of point at
that time.  Within the <code>progn</code>, the search function then moves
point to just after the zapped-to-character and <code>point</code> returns the
value of this location.  The <code>kill-region</code> function puts together
these two values of point, the first one as the beginning of the region
and the second one as the end of the region, and removes the region.

   </p>
<p>The <code>progn</code> special form is necessary because the
<code>kill-region</code> command takes two arguments; and it would fail if
<code>search-forward</code> and <code>point</code> expressions were written in
sequence as two additional arguments.  The <code>progn</code> expression is
a single argument to <code>kill-region</code> and returns the one value that
<code>kill-region</code> needs for its second argument.

</div>

<h3 class="section">8.2 <code>kill-region</code>
</h3>

<p><a name="index-kill_002dregion-193"></a>
The <code>zap-to-char</code> function uses the <code>kill-region</code> function. 
This function clips text from a region and copies that text to
the kill ring, from which it may be retrieved.

   </p>
<p>The Emacs 22 version of that function uses <code>condition-case</code> and
<code>copy-region-as-kill</code>, both of which we will explain. 
<code>condition-case</code> is an important special form.

   </p>
<p>In essence, the <code>kill-region</code> function calls
<code>condition-case</code>, which takes three arguments.  In this function,
the first argument does nothing.  The second argument contains the
code that does the work when all goes well.  The third argument
contains the code that is called in the event of an error.

added:

</p>

<h4 class="subsection">8.2.1 <code>condition-case</code>
</h4>

<p><a name="index-condition_002dcase-194"></a>
As we have seen earlier (see <a href="#Making-Errors">Generate an Error Message</a>), when the Emacs Lisp interpreter has trouble evaluating an
expression, it provides you with help; in the jargon, this is called
“signaling an error”.  Usually, the computer stops the program and
shows you a message.

   </p>
<p>However, some programs undertake complicated actions.  They should not
simply stop on an error.  In the <code>kill-region</code> function, the most
likely error is that you will try to kill text that is read-only and
cannot be removed.  So the <code>kill-region</code> function contains code
to handle this circumstance.  This code, which makes up the body of
the <code>kill-region</code> function, is inside of a <code>condition-case</code>
special form.

   </p>
<p>The template for <code>condition-case</code> looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (condition-case
       <var>var</var>
       <var>bodyform</var>
       <var>error-handler</var>...)
</pre>
   <p>The second argument, <var>bodyform</var>, is straightforward.  The
<code>condition-case</code> special form causes the Lisp interpreter to
evaluate the code in <var>bodyform</var>.  If no error occurs, the special
form returns the code's value and produces the side-effects, if any.

   </p>
<p>In short, the <var>bodyform</var> part of a <code>condition-case</code>
expression determines what should happen when everything works
correctly.

   </p>
<p>However, if an error occurs, among its other actions, the function
generating the error signal will define one or more error condition
names.

   </p>
<p>An error handler is the third argument to <code>condition-case</code>. 
An error handler has two parts, a <var>condition-name</var> and a
<var>body</var>.  If the <var>condition-name</var> part of an error handler
matches a condition name generated by an error, then the <var>body</var>
part of the error handler is run.

   </p>
<p>As you will expect, the <var>condition-name</var> part of an error handler
may be either a single condition name or a list of condition names.

   </p>
<p>Also, a complete <code>condition-case</code> expression may contain more
than one error handler.  When an error occurs, the first applicable
handler is run.

   </p>
<p>Lastly, the first argument to the <code>condition-case</code> expression,
the <var>var</var> argument, is sometimes bound to a variable that
contains information about the error.  However, if that argument is
nil, as is the case in <code>kill-region</code>, that information is
discarded.

   </p>
<p>In brief, in the <code>kill-region</code> function, the code
<code>condition-case</code> works like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     <var>If no errors</var>, <var>run only this code</var>
         <var>but</var>, <var>if errors</var>, <var>run this other code</var>.

<p><a name="index-Macro_002c-lisp-195"></a><a name="index-Lisp-macro-196"></a>
The part of the <code>condition-case</code> expression that is evaluated in
the expectation that all goes well has a <code>when</code>.  The code uses
<code>when</code> to determine whether the <code>string</code> variable points to
text that exists.

   </p>
<p>A <code>when</code> expression is simply a programmers' convenience.  It is
an <code>if</code> without the possibility of an else clause.  In your mind,
you can replace <code>when</code> with <code>if</code> and understand what goes
on.  That is what the Lisp interpreter does.

   </p>
<p>Technically speaking, <code>when</code> is a Lisp macro.  A Lisp macro
enables you to define new control constructs and other language
features.  It tells the interpreter how to compute another Lisp
expression which will in turn compute the value.  In this case, the
other expression is an <code>if</code> expression.

   </p>
<p>The <code>kill-region</code> function definition also has an <code>unless</code>
macro; it is the converse of <code>when</code>.  The <code>unless</code> macro is
an <code>if</code> without a then clause

   </p>
<p>For more about Lisp macros, see <a href="elisp.html#Macros">Macros</a>.  The C programming language also
provides macros.  These are different, but also useful.

   </p>
<p>Regarding the <code>when</code> macro, in the <code>condition-case</code>
expression, when the string has content, then another conditional
expression is executed.  This is an <code>if</code> with both a then-part
and an else-part.

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (if (eq last-command 'kill-region)
         (kill-append string (&lt; end beg) yank-handler)
       (kill-new string nil yank-handler))
</pre>
   <p>The then-part is evaluated if the previous command was another call to
<code>kill-region</code>; if not, the else-part is evaluated.

   </p>
<p><code>yank-handler</code> is an optional argument to <code>kill-region</code> that
tells the <code>kill-append</code> and <code>kill-new</code> functions how deal
with properties added to the text, such as bold or italics.

   </p>
<p><code>last-command</code> is a variable that comes with Emacs that we have
not seen before.  Normally, whenever a function is executed, Emacs
sets the value of <code>last-command</code> to the previous command.

   </p>
<p>In this segment of the definition, the <code>if</code> expression checks
whether the previous command was <code>kill-region</code>.  If it was,

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (kill-append string (&lt; end beg) yank-handler)

   <p class="noindent">concatenates a copy of the newly clipped text to the just previously
clipped text in the kill ring.

</h3>

<p><a name="index-copy_002dregion_002das_002dkill-197"></a><a name="index-nthcdr-198"></a>
The <code>copy-region-as-kill</code> function copies a region of text from a
buffer and (via either <code>kill-append</code> or <code>kill-new</code>) saves it
in the <code>kill-ring</code>.

   </p>
<p>If you call <code>copy-region-as-kill</code> immediately after a
<code>kill-region</code> command, Emacs appends the newly copied text to the
previously copied text.  This means that if you yank back the text, you
get it all, from both this and the previous operation.  On the other
hand, if some other command precedes the <code>copy-region-as-kill</code>,
the function copies the text into a separate entry in the kill ring.

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">The complete <code>copy-region-as-kill</code> function definition</h4>

   <p>Here is the complete text of the version 22 <code>copy-region-as-kill</code>
function:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun copy-region-as-kill (beg end)
       "Save the region as if killed, but don't kill it.
     In Transient Mark mode, deactivate the mark.
     If `interprogram-cut-function' is non-nil, also save the text for a window
     system cut and paste."
       (interactive "r")
       (if (eq last-command 'kill-region)
           (kill-append (filter-buffer-substring beg end) (&lt; end beg))
         (kill-new (filter-buffer-substring beg end)))
       (if transient-mark-mode
           (setq deactivate-mark t))
       nil)
</pre>
   <p>As usual, this function can be divided into its component parts:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun copy-region-as-kill (<var>argument-list</var>)
       "<var>documentation</var>..."
       (interactive "r")
       <var>body</var>...)
</pre>
   <p>The arguments are <code>beg</code> and <code>end</code> and the function is
interactive with <code>"r"</code>, so the two arguments must refer to the
beginning and end of the region.  If you have been reading through this
document from the beginning, understanding these parts of a function is
almost becoming routine.

   </p>
<p>The documentation is somewhat confusing unless you remember that the
word “kill” has a meaning different from usual.  The Transient Mark
and <code>interprogram-cut-function</code> comments explain certain
side-effects.

   </p>
<p>After you once set a mark, a buffer always contains a region.  If you
wish, you can use Transient Mark mode to highlight the region
temporarily.  (No one wants to highlight the region all the time, so
Transient Mark mode highlights it only at appropriate times.  Many
people turn off Transient Mark mode, so the region is never
highlighted.)

   </p>
<p>Also, a windowing system allows you to copy, cut, and paste among
different programs.  In the X windowing system, for example, the
<code>interprogram-cut-function</code> function is <code>x-select-text</code>,
which works with the windowing system's equivalent of the Emacs kill
ring.

   </p>
<p>The body of the <code>copy-region-as-kill</code> function starts with an
<code>if</code> clause.  What this clause does is distinguish between two
different situations: whether or not this command is executed
immediately after a previous <code>kill-region</code> command.  In the first
case, the new region is appended to the previously copied text. 
Otherwise, it is inserted into the beginning of the kill ring as a
separate piece of text from the previous piece.

   </p>
<p>The last two lines of the function prevent the region from lighting up
if Transient Mark mode is turned on.

   </p>
<p>The body of <code>copy-region-as-kill</code> merits discussion in detail.

<h4 class="subsection">8.3.1 The Body of <code>copy-region-as-kill</code>
</h4>

<p>The <code>copy-region-as-kill</code> function works in much the same way as
the <code>kill-region</code> function.  Both are written so that two or more
kills in a row combine their text into a single entry.  If you yank
back the text from the kill ring, you get it all in one piece. 
Moreover, kills that kill forward from the current position of the
cursor are added to the end of the previously copied text and commands
that copy text backwards add it to the beginning of the previously
copied text.  This way, the words in the text stay in the proper
order.

   </p>
<p>Like <code>kill-region</code>, the <code>copy-region-as-kill</code> function makes
use of the <code>last-command</code> variable that keeps track of the
previous Emacs command.

<code>last-command</code> and <code>this-command</code>
</h5>

   <p>Normally, whenever a function is executed, Emacs sets the value of
<code>this-command</code> to the function being executed (which in this case
would be <code>copy-region-as-kill</code>).  At the same time, Emacs sets
the value of <code>last-command</code> to the previous value of
<code>this-command</code>.

   </p>
<p>In the first part of the body of the <code>copy-region-as-kill</code>
function, an <code>if</code> expression determines whether the value of
<code>last-command</code> is <code>kill-region</code>.  If so, the then-part of
the <code>if</code> expression is evaluated; it uses the <code>kill-append</code>
function to concatenate the text copied at this call to the function
with the text already in the first element (the <span class="sc">car</span>) of the kill
ring.  On the other hand, if the value of <code>last-command</code> is not
<code>kill-region</code>, then the <code>copy-region-as-kill</code> function
attaches a new element to the kill ring using the <code>kill-new</code>
function.

   </p>
<p>The <code>if</code> expression reads as follows; it uses <code>eq</code>:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">       (if (eq last-command 'kill-region)
           ;; <span class="roman">then-part</span>
           (kill-append  (filter-buffer-substring beg end) (&lt; end beg))
         ;; <span class="roman">else-part</span>
         (kill-new  (filter-buffer-substring beg end)))
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-filter_002dbuffer_002dsubstring-199"></a>(The <code>filter-buffer-substring</code> function returns a filtered
substring of the buffer, if any.  Optionally—the arguments are not
here, so neither is done—the function may delete the initial text or
return the text without its properties; this function is a replacement
for the older <code>buffer-substring</code> function, which came before text
properties were implemented.)

   </p>
<p><a name="index-eq-_0040r_007b_0028example-of-use_0029_007d-200"></a>The <code>eq</code> function tests whether its first argument is the same Lisp
object as its second argument.  The <code>eq</code> function is similar to the
<code>equal</code> function in that it is used to test for equality, but
differs in that it determines whether two representations are actually
the same object inside the computer, but with different names. 
<code>equal</code> determines whether the structure and contents of two
expressions are the same.

   </p>
<p>If the previous command was <code>kill-region</code>, then the Emacs Lisp
interpreter calls the <code>kill-append</code> function

</p>
<div class="node">
<a name="kill-append-function"></a><a name="kill_002dappend-function"></a>
</div>

<h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">The <code>kill-append</code> function</h5>

<p><a name="index-kill_002dappend-201"></a>
The <code>kill-append</code> function looks like this:

<!-- in GNU Emacs 22 -->
</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun kill-append (string before-p &amp;optional yank-handler)
       "Append STRING to the end of the latest kill in the kill ring.
     If BEFORE-P is non-nil, prepend STRING to the kill.
     ... "
       (let* ((cur (car kill-ring)))
         (kill-new (if before-p (concat string cur) (concat cur string))
                   (or (= (length cur) 0)
                       (equal yank-handler
                              (get-text-property 0 'yank-handler cur)))
                   yank-handler)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The <code>kill-append</code> function is fairly straightforward.  It uses
the <code>kill-new</code> function, which we will discuss in more detail in
a moment.

   </p>
<p>(Also, the function provides an optional argument called
<code>yank-handler</code>; when invoked, this argument tells the function
how to deal with properties added to the text, such as bold or
italics.)

<!-- !!! bug in GNU Emacs 22 version of  kill-append ? -->
</p>
<p>It has a <code>let*</code> function to set the value of the first element of
the kill ring to <code>cur</code>.  (I do not know why the function does not
use <code>let</code> instead; only one value is set in the expression. 
Perhaps this is a bug that produces no problems?)

   </p>
<p>Consider the conditional that is one of the two arguments to
<code>kill-new</code>.  It uses <code>concat</code> to concatenate the new text to
the <span class="sc">car</span> of the kill ring.  Whether it prepends or appends the
text depends on the results of an <code>if</code> expression:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (if before-p                            ; <span class="roman">if-part</span>
         (concat string cur)                 ; <span class="roman">then-part</span>
       (concat cur string))                  ; <span class="roman">else-part</span>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If the region being killed is before the region that was killed in the
last command, then it should be prepended before the material that was
saved in the previous kill; and conversely, if the killed text follows
what was just killed, it should be appended after the previous text. 
The <code>if</code> expression depends on the predicate <code>before-p</code> to
decide whether the newly saved text should be put before or after the
previously saved text.

   </p>
<p>The symbol <code>before-p</code> is the name of one of the arguments to
<code>kill-append</code>.  When the <code>kill-append</code> function is
evaluated, it is bound to the value returned by evaluating the actual
argument.  In this case, this is the expression <code>(&lt; end beg)</code>. 
This expression does not directly determine whether the killed text in
this command is located before or after the kill text of the last
command; what it does is determine whether the value of the variable
<code>end</code> is less than the value of the variable <code>beg</code>.  If it
is, it means that the user is most likely heading towards the
beginning of the buffer.  Also, the result of evaluating the predicate
expression, <code>(&lt; end beg)</code>, will be true and the text will be
prepended before the previous text.  On the other hand, if the value of
the variable <code>end</code> is greater than the value of the variable
<code>beg</code>, the text will be appended after the previous text.

   </p>
<p>When the newly saved text will be prepended, then the string with the new
text will be concatenated before the old text:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (concat string cur)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">But if the text will be appended, it will be concatenated
after the old text:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (concat cur string))
</pre>
   <p>To understand how this works, we first need to review the
<code>concat</code> function.  The <code>concat</code> function links together or
unites two strings of text.  The result is a string.  For example:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (concat "abc" "def")
          =&gt; "abcdef"
     
     (concat "new "
             (car '("first element" "second element")))
          =&gt; "new first element"
     
     (concat (car
             '("first element" "second element")) " modified")
          =&gt; "first element modified"
</pre>
   <p>We can now make sense of <code>kill-append</code>: it modifies the contents
of the kill ring.  The kill ring is a list, each element of which is
saved text.  The <code>kill-append</code> function uses the <code>kill-new</code>
function which in turn uses the <code>setcar</code> function.

</p>
<div class="node">
<a name="kill-new-function"></a><a name="kill_002dnew-function"></a>
</div>

<h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">The <code>kill-new</code> function</h5>

<p><a name="index-kill_002dnew-202"></a>
In version 22 the <code>kill-new</code> function looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun kill-new (string &amp;optional replace yank-handler)
       "Make STRING the latest kill in the kill ring.
     Set `kill-ring-yank-pointer' to point to it.
     
     If `interprogram-cut-function' is non-nil, apply it to STRING.
     Optional second argument REPLACE non-nil means that STRING will replace
     the front of the kill ring, rather than being added to the list.
     ..."
       (if (&gt; (length string) 0)
           (if yank-handler
               (put-text-property 0 (length string)
                                  'yank-handler yank-handler string))
         (if yank-handler
             (signal 'args-out-of-range
                     (list string "yank-handler specified for empty string"))))
       (if (fboundp 'menu-bar-update-yank-menu)
           (menu-bar-update-yank-menu string (and replace (car kill-ring))))
       (if (and replace kill-ring)
           (setcar kill-ring string)
         (push string kill-ring)
         (if (&gt; (length kill-ring) kill-ring-max)
             (setcdr (nthcdr (1- kill-ring-max) kill-ring) nil)))
       (setq kill-ring-yank-pointer kill-ring)
       (if interprogram-cut-function
           (funcall interprogram-cut-function string (not replace))))
</pre>
   <p>(Notice that the function is not interactive.)

   </p>
<p>As usual, we can look at this function in parts.

   </p>
<p>The function definition has an optional <code>yank-handler</code> argument,
which when invoked tells the function how to deal with properties
added to the text, such as bold or italics.  We will skip that.

   </p>
<p>The first line of the documentation makes sense:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     Make STRING the latest kill in the kill ring.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Let's skip over the rest of the documentation for the moment.

</p>
<p class="noindent">Also, let's skip over the initial <code>if</code> expression and those lines
of code involving <code>menu-bar-update-yank-menu</code>.  We will explain
them below.

   </p>
<p>The critical lines are these:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">       (if (and replace kill-ring)
           ;; <span class="roman">then</span>
           (setcar kill-ring string)
         ;; <span class="roman">else</span>
         (push string kill-ring)
         (if (&gt; (length kill-ring) kill-ring-max)
             ;; <span class="roman">avoid overly long kill ring</span>
             (setcdr (nthcdr (1- kill-ring-max) kill-ring) nil)))
       (setq kill-ring-yank-pointer kill-ring)
       (if interprogram-cut-function
           (funcall interprogram-cut-function string (not replace))))
</pre>
   <p>The conditional test is <code>(and replace kill-ring)</code><!-- /@w -->. 
This will be true when two conditions are met:  the kill ring has
something in it, and the <code>replace</code> variable is true.

   </p>
<p>When the <code>kill-append</code> function sets <code>replace</code> to be true
and when the kill ring has at least one item in it, the <code>setcar</code>
expression is executed:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setcar kill-ring string)
</pre>
   <p>The <code>setcar</code> function actually changes the first element of the
<code>kill-ring</code> list to the value of <code>string</code>.  It replaces the
first element.

   </p>
<p>On the other hand, if the kill ring is empty, or replace is false, the
else-part of the condition is executed:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (push string kill-ring)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><code>push</code> puts its first argument onto the second.  It is similar to
the older

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setq kill-ring (cons string kill-ring))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">or the newer

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (add-to-list kill-ring string)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">When it is false, the expression first constructs a new version of the
kill ring by prepending <code>string</code> to the existing kill ring as a
new element (that is what the <code>push</code> does).  Then it executes a
second <code>if</code> clause.  This second <code>if</code> clause keeps the kill
ring from growing too long.

   </p>
<p>Let's look at these two expressions in order.

   </p>
<p>The <code>push</code> line of the else-part sets the new value of the kill
ring to what results from adding the string being killed to the old
kill ring.

   </p>
<p>We can see how this works with an example.

   </p>
<p>First,

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setq example-list '("here is a clause" "another clause"))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">After evaluating this expression with <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>, you can evaluate
<code>example-list</code> and see what it returns:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     example-list
          =&gt; ("here is a clause" "another clause")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Now, we can add a new element on to this list by evaluating the
following expression:
<a name="index-push_002c-_0040r_007bexample_007d-203"></a>
</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (push "a third clause" example-list)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">When we evaluate <code>example-list</code>, we find its value is:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     example-list
          =&gt; ("a third clause" "here is a clause" "another clause")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Thus, the third clause is added to the list by <code>push</code>.

   </p>
<p>Now for the second part of the <code>if</code> clause.  This expression
keeps the kill ring from growing too long.  It looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (if (&gt; (length kill-ring) kill-ring-max)
         (setcdr (nthcdr (1- kill-ring-max) kill-ring) nil))
</pre>
   <p>The code checks whether the length of the kill ring is greater than
the maximum permitted length.  This is the value of
<code>kill-ring-max</code> (which is 60, by default).  If the length of the
kill ring is too long, then this code sets the last element of the
kill ring to <code>nil</code>.  It does this by using two functions,
<code>nthcdr</code> and <code>setcdr</code>.

   </p>
<p>We looked at <code>setcdr</code> earlier (see <a href="#setcdr"><code>setcdr</code></a>). 
It sets the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of a list, just as <code>setcar</code> sets the
<span class="sc">car</span> of a list.  In this case, however, <code>setcdr</code> will not be
setting the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of the whole kill ring; the <code>nthcdr</code>
function is used to cause it to set the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of the next to last
element of the kill ring—this means that since the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of the
next to last element is the last element of the kill ring, it will set
the last element of the kill ring.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-nthcdr_002c-_0040r_007bexample_007d-204"></a>The <code>nthcdr</code> function works by repeatedly taking the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of a
list—it takes the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of the <span class="sc">cdr</span>
<small class="dots">...</small>  It does this <var>N</var> times and returns the results. 
(See <a href="#nthcdr"><code>nthcdr</code></a>.)

   </p>
<p><a name="index-setcdr_002c-_0040r_007bexample_007d-205"></a>Thus, if we had a four element list that was supposed to be three
elements long, we could set the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of the next to last element
to <code>nil</code>, and thereby shorten the list.  (If you set the last
element to some other value than <code>nil</code>, which you could do, then
you would not have shortened the list.  See <a href="#setcdr"><code>setcdr</code></a>.)

   </p>
<p>You can see shortening by evaluating the following three expressions
in turn.  First set the value of <code>trees</code> to <code>(maple oak pine
birch)</code>, then set the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of its second <span class="sc">cdr</span> to <code>nil</code>
and then find the value of <code>trees</code>:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setq trees '(maple oak pine birch))
          =&gt; (maple oak pine birch)
     
     (setcdr (nthcdr 2 trees) nil)
          =&gt; nil
     
     trees
          =&gt; (maple oak pine)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(The value returned by the <code>setcdr</code> expression is <code>nil</code> since
that is what the <span class="sc">cdr</span> is set to.)

   </p>
<p>To repeat, in <code>kill-new</code>, the <code>nthcdr</code> function takes the
<span class="sc">cdr</span> a number of times that is one less than the maximum permitted
size of the kill ring and <code>setcdr</code> sets the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of that
element (which will be the rest of the elements in the kill ring) to
<code>nil</code>.  This prevents the kill ring from growing too long.

   </p>
<p>The next to last expression in the <code>kill-new</code> function is

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setq kill-ring-yank-pointer kill-ring)
</pre>
   <p>The <code>kill-ring-yank-pointer</code> is a global variable that is set to be
the <code>kill-ring</code>.

   </p>
<p>Even though the <code>kill-ring-yank-pointer</code> is called a
`<samp><span class="samp">pointer</span></samp>', it is a variable just like the kill ring.  However, the
name has been chosen to help humans understand how the variable is used.

   </p>
<p>Now, to return to an early expression in the body of the function:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">       (if (fboundp 'menu-bar-update-yank-menu)
            (menu-bar-update-yank-menu string (and replace (car kill-ring))))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">It starts with an <code>if</code> expression

   </p>
<p>In this case, the expression tests first to see whether
<code>menu-bar-update-yank-menu</code> exists as a function, and if so,
calls it.  The <code>fboundp</code> function returns true if the symbol it
is testing has a function definition that is not void.  If the
symbol's function definition were void, we would receive an error
message, as we did when we created errors intentionally (see <a href="#Making-Errors">Generate an Error Message</a>).

</p>
<p class="noindent">The then-part contains an expression whose first element is the
function <code>and</code>.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-and-206"></a>The <code>and</code> special form evaluates each of its arguments until one
of the arguments returns a value of <code>nil</code>, in which case the
<code>and</code> expression returns <code>nil</code>; however, if none of the
arguments returns a value of <code>nil</code>, the value resulting from
evaluating the last argument is returned.  (Since such a value is not
<code>nil</code>, it is considered true in Emacs Lisp.)  In other words, an
<code>and</code> expression returns a true value only if all its arguments
are true.  (See <a href="#Second-Buffer-Related-Review">Second Buffer Related Review</a>.)

   </p>
<p>The expression determines whether the second argument to
<code>menu-bar-update-yank-menu</code> is true or not.

   </p>
<p><code>menu-bar-update-yank-menu</code> is one of the functions that make it
possible to use the “Select and Paste” menu in the Edit item of a menu
bar; using a mouse, you can look at the various pieces of text you
have saved and select one piece to paste.

   </p>
<p>The last expression in the <code>kill-new</code> function adds the newly
copied string to whatever facility exists for copying and pasting
among different programs running in a windowing system.  In the X
Windowing system, for example, the <code>x-select-text</code> function takes
the string and stores it in memory operated by X.  You can paste the
string in another program, such as an Xterm.

   </p>
<p>The expression looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">       (if interprogram-cut-function
           (funcall interprogram-cut-function string (not replace))))
</pre>
   <p>If an <code>interprogram-cut-function</code> exists, then Emacs executes
<code>funcall</code>, which in turn calls its first argument as a function
and passes the remaining arguments to it.  (Incidentally, as far as I
can see, this <code>if</code> expression could be replaced by an <code>and</code>
expression similar to the one in the first part of the function.)

   </p>
<p>We are not going to discuss windowing systems and other programs
further, but merely note that this is a mechanism that enables GNU
Emacs to work easily and well with other programs.

   </p>
<p>This code for placing text in the kill ring, either concatenated with
an existing element or as a new element, leads us to the code for
bringing back text that has been cut out of the buffer—the yank
commands.  However, before discussing the yank commands, it is better
to learn how lists are implemented in a computer.  This will make
clear such mysteries as the use of the term “pointer”.  But before
that, we will digress into C.

<h3 class="section">8.4 Digression into C</h3>

<p><a name="index-delete_002dand_002dextract_002dregion-207"></a><a name="index-C_002c-a-digression-into-208"></a><a name="index-Digression-into-C-209"></a>
The <code>copy-region-as-kill</code> function (see <a href="#copy_002dregion_002das_002dkill"><code>copy-region-as-kill</code></a>) uses the <code>filter-buffer-substring</code>
function, which in turn uses the <code>delete-and-extract-region</code>
function.  It removes the contents of a region and you cannot get them
back.

   </p>
<p>Unlike the other code discussed here, the
<code>delete-and-extract-region</code> function is not written in Emacs
Lisp; it is written in C and is one of the primitives of the GNU Emacs
system.  Since it is very simple, I will digress briefly from Lisp and
describe it here.

<!-- GNU Emacs 24  in src/editfns.c -->
<!-- the DEFUN for  delete-and-extract-region -->
</p>
<p>Like many of the other Emacs primitives,
<code>delete-and-extract-region</code> is written as an instance of a C
macro, a macro being a template for code.  The complete macro looks
like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     DEFUN ("delete-and-extract-region", Fdelete_and_extract_region,
            Sdelete_and_extract_region, 2, 2, 0,
            doc: /* Delete the text between START and END and return it.  */)
            (Lisp_Object start, Lisp_Object end)
     {
       validate_region (&amp;start, &amp;end);
       if (XINT (start) == XINT (end))
         return empty_unibyte_string;
       return del_range_1 (XINT (start), XINT (end), 1, 1);
     }
</pre>
   <p>Without going into the details of the macro writing process, let me
point out that this macro starts with the word <code>DEFUN</code>.  The word
<code>DEFUN</code> was chosen since the code serves the same purpose as
<code>defun</code> does in Lisp.  (The <code>DEFUN</code> C macro is defined in
<samp><span class="file">emacs/src/lisp.h</span></samp>.)

   </p>
<p>The word <code>DEFUN</code> is followed by seven parts inside of
parentheses:

     </p>
<ul>
<li>The first part is the name given to the function in Lisp,
<code>delete-and-extract-region</code>.

     </li>
<li>The second part is the name of the function in C,
<code>Fdelete_and_extract_region</code>.  By convention, it starts with
`<samp><span class="samp">F</span></samp>'.  Since C does not use hyphens in names, underscores are used
instead.

     </li>
<li>The third part is the name for the C constant structure that records
information on this function for internal use.  It is the name of the
function in C but begins with an `<samp><span class="samp">S</span></samp>' instead of an `<samp><span class="samp">F</span></samp>'.

     </li>
<li>The fourth and fifth parts specify the minimum and maximum number of
arguments the function can have.  This function demands exactly 2
arguments.

     </li>
<li>The sixth part is nearly like the argument that follows the
<code>interactive</code> declaration in a function written in Lisp: a letter
followed, perhaps, by a prompt.  The only difference from Lisp is
when the macro is called with no arguments.  Then you write a <code>0</code>
(which is a null string), as in this macro.

     <p>If you were to specify arguments, you would place them between
quotation marks.  The C macro for <code>goto-char</code> includes
<code>"NGoto char: "</code> in this position to indicate that the function
expects a raw prefix, in this case, a numerical location in a buffer,
and provides a prompt.

     </p>
</li>
<li>The seventh part is a documentation string, just like the one for a
function written in Emacs Lisp.  This is written as a C comment.  (When
you build Emacs, the program <samp><span class="command">lib-src/make-docfile</span></samp> extracts
these comments and uses them to make the documentation.) 
</li>
</ul>

   <p>In a C macro, the formal parameters come next, with a statement of
what kind of object they are, followed by the body
of the macro.  For <code>delete-and-extract-region</code> the body
consists of the following four lines:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     validate_region (&amp;start, &amp;end);
     if (XINT (start) == XINT (end))
       return empty_unibyte_string;
     return del_range_1 (XINT (start), XINT (end), 1, 1);
</pre>
   <p>The <code>validate_region</code> function checks whether the values
passed as the beginning and end of the region are the proper type and
are within range.  If the beginning and end positions are the same,
then return an empty string.

   </p>
<p>The <code>del_range_1</code> function actually deletes the text.  It is a
complex function we will not look into.  It updates the buffer and
does other things.  However, it is worth looking at the two arguments
passed to <code>del_range_1</code>.  These are <code>XINT (start)</code><!-- /@w --> and
<code>XINT (end)</code><!-- /@w -->.

   </p>
<p>As far as the C language is concerned, <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> are
two integers that mark the beginning and end of the region to be
deleted<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-10" name="fnd-10"><sup>10</sup></a>.

   </p>
<p>Integer widths depend on the machine, and are typically 32 or 64 bits. 
A few of the bits are used to specify the type of information; the
remaining bits are used as content.

   </p>
<p>`<samp><span class="samp">XINT</span></samp>' is a C macro that extracts the relevant number from the
longer collection of bits; the type bits are discarded.

   </p>
<p>The command in <code>delete-and-extract-region</code> looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     del_range_1 (XINT (start), XINT (end), 1, 1);
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">It deletes the region between the beginning position, <code>start</code>,
and the ending position, <code>end</code>.

   </p>
<p>From the point of view of the person writing Lisp, Emacs is all very
simple; but hidden underneath is a great deal of complexity to make it
all work.

<h3 class="section">8.5 Initializing a Variable with <code>defvar</code>
</h3>

<p><a name="index-defvar-210"></a><a name="index-Initializing-a-variable-211"></a><a name="index-Variable-initialization-212"></a>

   </p>
<p>The <code>copy-region-as-kill</code> function is written in Emacs Lisp.  Two
functions within it, <code>kill-append</code> and <code>kill-new</code>, copy a
region in a buffer and save it in a variable called the
<code>kill-ring</code>.  This section describes how the <code>kill-ring</code>
variable is created and initialized using the <code>defvar</code> special
form.

   </p>
<p>(Again we note that the term <code>kill-ring</code> is a misnomer.  The text
that is clipped out of the buffer can be brought back; it is not a ring
of corpses, but a ring of resurrectable text.)

   </p>
<p>In Emacs Lisp, a variable such as the <code>kill-ring</code> is created and
given an initial value by using the <code>defvar</code> special form.  The
name comes from “define variable”.

   </p>
<p>The <code>defvar</code> special form is similar to <code>setq</code> in that it sets
the value of a variable.  It is unlike <code>setq</code> in two ways: first,
it only sets the value of the variable if the variable does not already
have a value.  If the variable already has a value, <code>defvar</code> does
not override the existing value.  Second, <code>defvar</code> has a
documentation string.

   </p>
<p>(There is a related macro, <code>defcustom</code>, designed for variables
that people customize.  It has more features than <code>defvar</code>. 
(See <a href="#defcustom">Setting Variables with <code>defcustom</code></a>.)

</li>
</ul>

<div class="node"><a name="See-variable-current-value"></a></div>

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Seeing the Current Value of a Variable</h4>

   <p>You can see the current value of a variable, any variable, by using
the <code>describe-variable</code> function, which is usually invoked by
typing <kbd>C-h v</kbd>.  If you type <kbd>C-h v</kbd> and then <code>kill-ring</code>
(followed by &lt;RET&gt;) when prompted, you will see what is in your
current kill ring—this may be quite a lot!  Conversely, if you have
been doing nothing this Emacs session except read this document, you
may have nothing in it.  Also, you will see the documentation for
<code>kill-ring</code>:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     Documentation:
     List of killed text sequences.
     Since the kill ring is supposed to interact nicely with cut-and-paste
     facilities offered by window systems, use of this variable should
     interact nicely with `interprogram-cut-function' and
     `interprogram-paste-function'.  The functions `kill-new',
     `kill-append', and `current-kill' are supposed to implement this
     interaction; you may want to use them instead of manipulating the kill
     ring directly.
</pre>
   <p>The kill ring is defined by a <code>defvar</code> in the following way:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defvar kill-ring nil
       "List of killed text sequences.
     ...")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this variable definition, the variable is given an initial value of
<code>nil</code>, which makes sense, since if you have saved nothing, you want
nothing back if you give a <code>yank</code> command.  The documentation
string is written just like the documentation string of a <code>defun</code>. 
As with the documentation string of the <code>defun</code>, the first line of
the documentation should be a complete sentence, since some commands,
like <code>apropos</code>, print only the first line of documentation. 
Succeeding lines should not be indented; otherwise they look odd when
you use <kbd>C-h v</kbd> (<code>describe-variable</code>).

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="defvar-and-asterisk"></a></div>

<h4 class="subsection">8.5.1 <code>defvar</code> and an asterisk</h4>

<p><a name="index-defvar-_0040r_007bfor-a-user-customizable-variable_007d-213"></a><a name="index-defvar-_0040r_007bwith-an-asterisk_007d-214"></a>
In the past, Emacs used the <code>defvar</code> special form both for
internal variables that you would not expect a user to change and for
variables that you do expect a user to change.  Although you can still
use <code>defvar</code> for user customizable variables, please use
<code>defcustom</code> instead, since it provides a path into
the Customization commands.  (See <a href="#defcustom">Specifying Variables using <code>defcustom</code></a>.)

   </p>
<p>When you specified a variable using the <code>defvar</code> special form,
you could distinguish a variable that a user might want to change from
others by typing an asterisk, `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>', in the first column of its
documentation string.  For example:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defvar shell-command-default-error-buffer nil
       "*Buffer name for `shell-command' ... error output.
     ... ")
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-set_002dvariable-215"></a>You could (and still can) use the <code>set-variable</code> command to
change the value of <code>shell-command-default-error-buffer</code>
temporarily.  However, options set using <code>set-variable</code> are set
only for the duration of your editing session.  The new values are not
saved between sessions.  Each time Emacs starts, it reads the original
value, unless you change the value within your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file,
either by setting it manually or by using <code>customize</code>. 
See <a href="#Emacs-Initialization">Your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> File</a>.

   </p>
<p>For me, the major use of the <code>set-variable</code> command is to suggest
variables that I might want to set in my <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file.  There
are now more than 700 such variables, far too many to remember
readily.  Fortunately, you can press &lt;TAB&gt; after calling the
<code>M-x set-variable</code> command to see the list of variables.

<p>Here is a brief summary of some recently introduced functions.

     </p>
<dl>
<dt>
<code>car</code><dt><code>cdr</code></dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<code>car</code> returns the first element of a list; <code>cdr</code> returns the
second and subsequent elements of a list.

     <p>For example:

     </p>
<pre class="smallexample">          (car '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7))
               =&gt; 1
          (cdr '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7))
               =&gt; (2 3 4 5 6 7)
     </pre>
     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>cons</code></dt>
<dd>
<code>cons</code> constructs a list by prepending its first argument to its
second argument.

     <p>For example:

     </p>
<pre class="smallexample">          (cons 1 '(2 3 4))
               =&gt; (1 2 3 4)
     </pre>
     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>funcall</code></dt>
<dd>
<code>funcall</code> evaluates its first argument as a function.  It passes
its remaining arguments to its first argument.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>nthcdr</code></dt>
<dd>Return the result of taking <span class="sc">cdr</span> <var>n</var> times on a list. 
The “rest of the rest”, as it were.

     <p>For example:

     </p>
<pre class="smallexample">          (nthcdr 3 '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7))
               =&gt; (4 5 6 7)
     </pre>
     <br>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>setcar</code><dt><code>setcdr</code></dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<code>setcar</code> changes the first element of a list; <code>setcdr</code>
changes the second and subsequent elements of a list.

     <p>For example:

     </p>
<pre class="smallexample">          (setq triple '(1 2 3))
          
          (setcar triple '37)

               =&gt; (37 "foo" "bar")
     </pre>
     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>progn</code></dt>
<dd>Evaluate each argument in sequence and then return the value of the
last.

     <p>For example:

     </p>
<pre class="smallexample">          (progn 1 2 3 4)
               =&gt; 4
     </pre>
     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>save-restriction</code></dt>
<dd>Record whatever narrowing is in effect in the current buffer, if any,
and restore that narrowing after evaluating the arguments.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>search-forward</code></dt>
<dd>Search for a string, and if the string is found, move point.  With a
regular expression, use the similar <code>re-search-forward</code>. 
(See <a href="#Regexp-Search">Regular Expression Searches</a>, for an
explanation of regular expression patterns and searches.)

     <p class="noindent"><code>search-forward</code> and <code>re-search-forward</code> take four
arguments:

<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>The string or regular expression to search for.

          </li>
<li>Optionally, the limit of the search.

<li>Optionally, what to do if the search fails, return <code>nil</code> or an
error message.

          </li>
<li>Optionally, how many times to repeat the search; if negative, the
search goes backwards.
          </li>
</ol>

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>kill-region</code><dt>
<code>delete-and-extract-region</code><dt><code>copy-region-as-kill</code></dt>
</dt>
</dt>
<dd>
<code>kill-region</code> cuts the text between point and mark from the
buffer and stores that text in the kill ring, so you can get it back
by yanking.

     <p><code>copy-region-as-kill</code> copies the text between point and mark into
the kill ring, from which you can get it by yanking.  The function
does not cut or remove the text from the buffer. 
</p>
</dd>

   <p><code>delete-and-extract-region</code> removes the text between point and
mark from the buffer and throws it away.  You cannot get it back.

     <ul>
<li>Write an interactive function that searches for a string.  If the
search finds the string, leave point after it and display a message
that says “Found!”.  (Do not use <code>search-forward</code> for the name
of this function; if you do, you will overwrite the existing version of
<code>search-forward</code> that comes with Emacs.  Use a name such as
<code>test-search</code> instead.)

<h2 class="chapter">9 How Lists are Implemented</h2>

<p><a name="index-Lists-in-a-computer-216"></a>
In Lisp, atoms are recorded in a straightforward fashion; if the
implementation is not straightforward in practice, it is, nonetheless,
straightforward in theory.  The atom `<samp><span class="samp">rose</span></samp>', for example, is
recorded as the four contiguous letters `<samp><span class="samp">r</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">o</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">s</span></samp>',
`<samp><span class="samp">e</span></samp>'.  A list, on the other hand, is kept differently.  The mechanism
is equally simple, but it takes a moment to get used to the idea.  A
list is kept using a series of pairs of pointers.  In the series, the
first pointer in each pair points to an atom or to another list, and the
second pointer in each pair points to the next pair, or to the symbol
<code>nil</code>, which marks the end of the list.

   </p>
<p>A pointer itself is quite simply the electronic address of what is
pointed to.  Hence, a list is kept as a series of electronic addresses.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Lists diagrammed</h3>

   <p>For example, the list <code>(rose violet buttercup)</code> has three elements,
`<samp><span class="samp">rose</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">violet</span></samp>', and `<samp><span class="samp">buttercup</span></samp>'.  In the computer, the
electronic address of `<samp><span class="samp">rose</span></samp>' is recorded in a segment of computer
memory along with the address that gives the electronic address of where
the atom `<samp><span class="samp">violet</span></samp>' is located; and that address (the one that tells
where `<samp><span class="samp">violet</span></samp>' is located) is kept along with an address that tells
where the address for the atom `<samp><span class="samp">buttercup</span></samp>' is located.

In the diagram, each box represents a word of computer memory that
holds a Lisp object, usually in the form of a memory address.  The boxes,
i.e., the addresses, are in pairs.  Each arrow points to what the address
is the address of, either an atom or another pair of addresses.  The
first box is the electronic address of `<samp><span class="samp">rose</span></samp>' and the arrow points
to `<samp><span class="samp">rose</span></samp>'; the second box is the address of the next pair of boxes,
the first part of which is the address of `<samp><span class="samp">violet</span></samp>' and the second
part of which is the address of the next pair.  The very last box
points to the symbol <code>nil</code>, which marks the end of the list.

   <p>When a variable is set to a list with a function such as <code>setq</code>,
it stores the address of the first box in the variable.  Thus,
evaluation of the expression

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setq bouquet '(rose violet buttercup))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">creates a situation like this:

<!-- cons-cell-diagram #2 -->
</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     bouquet
          |

</pre>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

In this example, the symbol <code>bouquet</code> holds the address of the first
pair of boxes.

   <p>This same list can be illustrated in a different sort of box notation
like this:

<!-- cons-cell-diagram #2a -->

(Symbols consist of more than pairs of addresses, but the structure of
a symbol is made up of addresses.  Indeed, the symbol <code>bouquet</code>
consists of a group of address-boxes, one of which is the address of
the printed word `<samp><span class="samp">bouquet</span></samp>', a second of which is the address of a
function definition attached to the symbol, if any, a third of which
is the address of the first pair of address-boxes for the list
<code>(rose violet buttercup)</code>, and so on.  Here we are showing that
the symbol's third address-box points to the first pair of
address-boxes for the list.)

   <p>If a symbol is set to the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of a list, the list itself is not
changed; the symbol simply has an address further down the list.  (In
the jargon, <span class="sc">car</span> and <span class="sc">cdr</span> are “non-destructive”.)  Thus,
evaluation of the following expression

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setq flowers (cdr bouquet))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">produces this:

<!-- cons-cell-diagram #3 -->

   <pre class="sp">

   <pre class="sp">

The value of <code>flowers</code> is <code>(violet buttercup)</code>, which is
to say, the symbol <code>flowers</code> holds the address of the pair of
address-boxes, the first of which holds the address of <code>violet</code>,
and the second of which holds the address of <code>buttercup</code>.

   <p>A pair of address-boxes is called a <dfn>cons cell</dfn> or <dfn>dotted
pair</dfn>.  See <a href="elisp.html#Cons-Cell-Type">Cons Cell and List Types</a>, and <a href="elisp.html#Dotted-Pair-Notation">Dotted Pair Notation</a>, for more
information about cons cells and dotted pairs.

   </p>
<p>The function <code>cons</code> adds a new pair of addresses to the front of
a series of addresses like that shown above.  For example, evaluating
the expression

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setq bouquet (cons 'lily bouquet))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">produces:

<!-- cons-cell-diagram #4 -->

However, this does not change the value of the symbol
<code>flowers</code>, as you can see by evaluating the following,

<pre class="smallexample">     (eq (cdr (cdr bouquet)) flowers)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which returns <code>t</code> for true.

   </p>
<p>Until it is reset, <code>flowers</code> still has the value
<code>(violet buttercup)</code>; that is, it has the address of the cons
cell whose first address is of <code>violet</code>.  Also, this does not
alter any of the pre-existing cons cells; they are all still there.

   </p>
<p>Thus, in Lisp, to get the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of a list, you just get the address
of the next cons cell in the series; to get the <span class="sc">car</span> of a list,
you get the address of the first element of the list; to <code>cons</code> a
new element on a list, you add a new cons cell to the front of the list. 
That is all there is to it!  The underlying structure of Lisp is
brilliantly simple!

   </p>
<p>And what does the last address in a series of cons cells refer to?  It
is the address of the empty list, of <code>nil</code>.

   </p>
<p>In summary, when a Lisp variable is set to a value, it is provided with
the address of the list to which the variable refers.

In an earlier section, I suggested that you might imagine a symbol as
being a chest of drawers.  The function definition is put in one
drawer, the value in another, and so on.  What is put in the drawer
holding the value can be changed without affecting the contents of the
drawer holding the function definition, and vice versa.

   </p>
<p>Actually, what is put in each drawer is the address of the value or
function definition.  It is as if you found an old chest in the attic,
and in one of its drawers you found a map giving you directions to
where the buried treasure lies.

   </p>
<p>(In addition to its name, symbol definition, and variable value, a
symbol has a drawer for a <dfn>property list</dfn> which can be used to
record other information.  Property lists are not discussed here; see
<a href="elisp.html#Property-Lists">Property Lists</a>.)

Whenever you cut text out of a buffer with a kill command in GNU Emacs,
you can bring it back with a yank command.  The text that is cut out of
the buffer is put in the kill ring and the yank commands insert the
appropriate contents of the kill ring back into a buffer (not necessarily
the original buffer).

   </p>
<p>A simple <kbd>C-y</kbd> (<code>yank</code>) command inserts the first item from
the kill ring into the current buffer.  If the <kbd>C-y</kbd> command is
followed immediately by <kbd>M-y</kbd>, the first element is replaced by
the second element.  Successive <kbd>M-y</kbd> commands replace the second
element with the third, fourth, or fifth element, and so on.  When the
last element in the kill ring is reached, it is replaced by the first
element and the cycle is repeated.  (Thus the kill ring is called a
“ring” rather than just a “list”.  However, the actual data structure
that holds the text is a list. 
See <a href="#Kill-Ring">Handling the Kill Ring</a>, for the details of how the
list is handled as a ring.)

<h3 class="section">10.1 Kill Ring Overview</h3>

<p><a name="index-Kill-ring-overview-224"></a>
The kill ring is a list of textual strings.  This is what it looks like:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ("some text" "a different piece of text" "yet more text")
</pre>
   <p>If this were the contents of my kill ring and I pressed <kbd>C-y</kbd>, the
string of characters saying `<samp><span class="samp">some text</span></samp>' would be inserted in this
buffer where my cursor is located.

   </p>
<p>The <code>yank</code> command is also used for duplicating text by copying it. 
The copied text is not cut from the buffer, but a copy of it is put on the
kill ring and is inserted by yanking it back.

   </p>
<p>Three functions are used for bringing text back from the kill ring:
<code>yank</code>, which is usually bound to <kbd>C-y</kbd>; <code>yank-pop</code>,
which is usually bound to <kbd>M-y</kbd>; and <code>rotate-yank-pointer</code>,
which is used by the two other functions.

   </p>
<p>These functions refer to the kill ring through a variable called the
<code>kill-ring-yank-pointer</code>.  Indeed, the insertion code for both the
<code>yank</code> and <code>yank-pop</code> functions is:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (insert (car kill-ring-yank-pointer))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(Well, no more.  In GNU Emacs 22, the function has been replaced by
<code>insert-for-yank</code> which calls <code>insert-for-yank-1</code>
repetitively for each <code>yank-handler</code> segment.  In turn,
<code>insert-for-yank-1</code> strips text properties from the inserted text
according to <code>yank-excluded-properties</code>.  Otherwise, it is just
like <code>insert</code>.  We will stick with plain <code>insert</code> since it
is easier to understand.)

   </p>
<p>To begin to understand how <code>yank</code> and <code>yank-pop</code> work, it is
first necessary to look at the <code>kill-ring-yank-pointer</code> variable.

</div>

<h3 class="section">10.2 The <code>kill-ring-yank-pointer</code> Variable</h3>

<p><code>kill-ring-yank-pointer</code> is a variable, just as <code>kill-ring</code> is
a variable.  It points to something by being bound to the value of what
it points to, like any other Lisp variable.

   </p>
<p>Thus, if the value of the kill ring is:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ("some text" "a different piece of text" "yet more text")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and the <code>kill-ring-yank-pointer</code> points to the second clause, the
value of <code>kill-ring-yank-pointer</code> is:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ("a different piece of text" "yet more text")
</pre>
   <p>As explained in the previous chapter (see <a href="#List-Implementation">List Implementation</a>), the
computer does not keep two different copies of the text being pointed to
by both the <code>kill-ring</code> and the <code>kill-ring-yank-pointer</code>.  The
words “a different piece of text” and “yet more text” are not
duplicated.  Instead, the two Lisp variables point to the same pieces of
text.  Here is a diagram:

Both the variable <code>kill-ring</code> and the variable
<code>kill-ring-yank-pointer</code> are pointers.  But the kill ring itself is
usually described as if it were actually what it is composed of.  The
<code>kill-ring</code> is spoken of as if it were the list rather than that it
points to the list.  Conversely, the <code>kill-ring-yank-pointer</code> is
spoken of as pointing to a list.

   <p>These two ways of talking about the same thing sound confusing at first but
make sense on reflection.  The kill ring is generally thought of as the
complete structure of data that holds the information of what has recently
been cut out of the Emacs buffers.  The <code>kill-ring-yank-pointer</code>
on the other hand, serves to indicate—that is, to point to—that part
of the kill ring of which the first element (the <span class="sc">car</span>) will be
inserted.

Emacs Lisp has two primary ways to cause an expression, or a series of
expressions, to be evaluated repeatedly: one uses a <code>while</code>
loop, and the other uses <dfn>recursion</dfn>.

   </p>
<p>Repetition can be very valuable.  For example, to move forward four
sentences, you need only write a program that will move forward one
sentence and then repeat the process four times.  Since a computer does
not get bored or tired, such repetitive action does not have the
deleterious effects that excessive or the wrong kinds of repetition can
have on humans.

   </p>
<p>People mostly write Emacs Lisp functions using <code>while</code> loops and
their kin; but you can use recursion, which provides a very powerful
way to think about and then to solve problems<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-11" name="fnd-11"><sup>11</sup></a>.

<h3 class="section">11.1 <code>while</code>
</h3>

<p><a name="index-Loops-228"></a><a name="index-while-229"></a>
The <code>while</code> special form tests whether the value returned by
evaluating its first argument is true or false.  This is similar to what
the Lisp interpreter does with an <code>if</code>; what the interpreter does
next, however, is different.

   </p>
<p>In a <code>while</code> expression, if the value returned by evaluating the
first argument is false, the Lisp interpreter skips the rest of the
expression (the <dfn>body</dfn> of the expression) and does not evaluate it. 
However, if the value is true, the Lisp interpreter evaluates the body
of the expression and then again tests whether the first argument to
<code>while</code> is true or false.  If the value returned by evaluating the
first argument is again true, the Lisp interpreter again evaluates the
body of the expression.

   </p>
<p>The template for a <code>while</code> expression looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (while <var>true-or-false-test</var>
       <var>body</var>...)

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Looping with <code>while</code>
</h4>

   <p>So long as the true-or-false-test of the <code>while</code> expression
returns a true value when it is evaluated, the body is repeatedly
evaluated.  This process is called a loop since the Lisp interpreter
repeats the same thing again and again, like an airplane doing a loop. 
When the result of evaluating the true-or-false-test is false, the
Lisp interpreter does not evaluate the rest of the <code>while</code>
expression and exits the loop.

   </p>
<p>Clearly, if the value returned by evaluating the first argument to
<code>while</code> is always true, the body following will be evaluated
again and again <small class="dots">...</small> and again <small class="dots">...</small> forever.  Conversely, if the
value returned is never true, the expressions in the body will never
be evaluated.  The craft of writing a <code>while</code> loop consists of
choosing a mechanism such that the true-or-false-test returns true
just the number of times that you want the subsequent expressions to
be evaluated, and then have the test return false.

   </p>
<p>The value returned by evaluating a <code>while</code> is the value of the
true-or-false-test.  An interesting consequence of this is that a
<code>while</code> loop that evaluates without error will return <code>nil</code>
or false regardless of whether it has looped 1 or 100 times or none at
all.  A <code>while</code> expression that evaluates successfully never
returns a true value!  What this means is that <code>while</code> is always
evaluated for its side effects, which is to say, the consequences of
evaluating the expressions within the body of the <code>while</code> loop. 
This makes sense.  It is not the mere act of looping that is desired,
but the consequences of what happens when the expressions in the loop
are repeatedly evaluated.

<h4 class="subsection">11.1.1 A <code>while</code> Loop and a List</h4>

<p>A common way to control a <code>while</code> loop is to test whether a list
has any elements.  If it does, the loop is repeated; but if it does not,
the repetition is ended.  Since this is an important technique, we will
create a short example to illustrate it.

   </p>
<p>A simple way to test whether a list has elements is to evaluate the
list: if it has no elements, it is an empty list and will return the
empty list, <code>()</code>, which is a synonym for <code>nil</code> or false.  On
the other hand, a list with elements will return those elements when it
is evaluated.  Since Emacs Lisp considers as true any value that is not
<code>nil</code>, a list that returns elements will test true in a
<code>while</code> loop.

   </p>
<p>For example, you can set the variable <code>empty-list</code> to <code>nil</code> by
evaluating the following <code>setq</code> expression:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setq empty-list ())
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">After evaluating the <code>setq</code> expression, you can evaluate the
variable <code>empty-list</code> in the usual way, by placing the cursor after
the symbol and typing <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>; <code>nil</code> will appear in your
echo area:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     empty-list
</pre>
   <p>On the other hand, if you set a variable to be a list with elements, the
list will appear when you evaluate the variable, as you can see by
evaluating the following two expressions:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setq animals '(gazelle giraffe lion tiger))
     
     animals
</pre>
   <p>Thus, to create a <code>while</code> loop that tests whether there are any
items in the list <code>animals</code>, the first part of the loop will be
written like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (while animals
            ...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">When the <code>while</code> tests its first argument, the variable
<code>animals</code> is evaluated.  It returns a list.  So long as the list
has elements, the <code>while</code> considers the results of the test to be
true; but when the list is empty, it considers the results of the test
to be false.

   </p>
<p>To prevent the <code>while</code> loop from running forever, some mechanism
needs to be provided to empty the list eventually.  An oft-used
technique is to have one of the subsequent forms in the <code>while</code>
expression set the value of the list to be the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of the list. 
Each time the <code>cdr</code> function is evaluated, the list will be made
shorter, until eventually only the empty list will be left.  At this
point, the test of the <code>while</code> loop will return false, and the
arguments to the <code>while</code> will no longer be evaluated.

   </p>
<p>For example, the list of animals bound to the variable <code>animals</code>
can be set to be the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of the original list with the
following expression:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setq animals (cdr animals))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If you have evaluated the previous expressions and then evaluate this
expression, you will see <code>(giraffe lion tiger)</code> appear in the echo
area.  If you evaluate the expression again, <code>(lion tiger)</code> will
appear in the echo area.  If you evaluate it again and yet again,
<code>(tiger)</code> appears and then the empty list, shown by <code>nil</code>.

   </p>
<p>A template for a <code>while</code> loop that uses the <code>cdr</code> function
repeatedly to cause the true-or-false-test eventually to test false
looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (while <var>test-whether-list-is-empty</var>
       <var>body</var>...
       <var>set-list-to-cdr-of-list</var>)
</pre>
   <p>This test and use of <code>cdr</code> can be put together in a function that
goes through a list and prints each element of the list on a line of its
own.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007b_002ascratch_002a_007d-buffer-231"></a>The function requires several lines for its output.  If you are
reading this in a recent instance of GNU Emacs,
<!-- GNU Emacs 21, GNU Emacs 22, or a later version, -->
you can evaluate the following expression inside of Info, as usual.

   </p>
<p>If you are using an earlier version of Emacs, you need to copy the
necessary expressions to your <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer and evaluate
them there.  This is because the echo area had only one line in the
earlier versions.

   </p>
<p>You can copy the expressions by marking the beginning of the region
with <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> (<code>set-mark-command</code>), moving the cursor to
the end of the region and then copying the region using <kbd>M-w</kbd>
(<code>kill-ring-save</code>, which calls <code>copy-region-as-kill</code> and
then provides visual feedback).  In the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp>
buffer, you can yank the expressions back by typing <kbd>C-y</kbd>
(<code>yank</code>).

   </p>
<p>After you have copied the expressions to the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer,
evaluate each expression in turn.  Be sure to evaluate the last
expression, <code>(print-elements-of-list animals)</code>, by typing
<kbd>C-u C-x C-e</kbd>, that is, by giving an argument to
<code>eval-last-sexp</code>.  This will cause the result of the evaluation
to be printed in the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer instead of being printed
in the echo area.  (Otherwise you will see something like this in your
echo area: <code>^Jgazelle^J^Jgiraffe^J^Jlion^J^Jtiger^Jnil</code>, in which
each `<samp><span class="samp">^J</span></samp>' stands for a newline.)

   </p>
<p>In a recent instance of GNU Emacs, you can evaluate these expressions
directly in the Info buffer, and the echo area will grow to show the
results.

   <p>Each element of the list is printed on a line of its own (that is what
the function <code>print</code> does) and then the value returned by the

<h4 class="subsection">11.1.3 A Loop with an Incrementing Counter</h4>

<p>A loop is not useful unless it stops when it ought.  Besides
controlling a loop with a list, a common way of stopping a loop is to
write the first argument as a test that returns false when the correct
number of repetitions are complete.  This means that the loop must
have a counter—an expression that counts how many times the loop
repeats itself.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Incrementing-Loop-Details"></a></div>

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Details of an Incrementing Loop</h4>

   <p>The test for a loop with an incrementing counter can be an expression
such as <code>(&lt; count desired-number)</code> which returns <code>t</code> for
true if the value of <code>count</code> is less than the
<code>desired-number</code> of repetitions and <code>nil</code> for false if the
value of <code>count</code> is equal to or is greater than the
<code>desired-number</code>.  The expression that increments the count can
be a simple <code>setq</code> such as <code>(setq count (1+ count))</code>, where
<code>1+</code> is a built-in function in Emacs Lisp that adds 1 to its
argument.  (The expression <code>(1+ count)</code><!-- /@w --> has the same result
as <code>(+ count 1)</code><!-- /@w -->, but is easier for a human to read.)

   </p>
<p>The template for a <code>while</code> loop controlled by an incrementing
counter looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     <var>set-count-to-initial-value</var>
     (while (&lt; count desired-number)         ; <span class="roman">true-or-false-test</span>
       <var>body</var>...
       (setq count (1+ count)))              ; <span class="roman">incrementer</span>

   <p class="noindent">Note that you need to set the initial value of <code>count</code>; usually it
is set to 1.

<h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">Example with incrementing counter</h5>

<p>Suppose you are playing on the beach and decide to make a triangle of
pebbles, putting one pebble in the first row, two in the second row,
three in the third row and so on, like this:

   </p>
<pre class="sp">

</pre>
<!-- pebble diagram -->
<pre class="smallexample">                    *
                   * *
                  * * *
                 * * * *
</pre>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

(About 2500 years ago, Pythagoras and others developed the beginnings of
number theory by considering questions such as this.)

   <p>Suppose you want to know how many pebbles you will need to make a
triangle with 7 rows?

   </p>
<p>Clearly, what you need to do is add up the numbers from 1 to 7.  There
are two ways to do this; start with the smallest number, one, and add up
the list in sequence, 1, 2, 3, 4 and so on; or start with the largest
number and add the list going down: 7, 6, 5, 4 and so on.  Because both
mechanisms illustrate common ways of writing <code>while</code> loops, we will
create two examples, one counting up and the other counting down.  In
this first example, we will start with 1 and add 2, 3, 4 and so on.

   </p>
<p>If you are just adding up a short list of numbers, the easiest way to do
it is to add up all the numbers at once.  However, if you do not know
ahead of time how many numbers your list will have, or if you want to be
prepared for a very long list, then you need to design your addition so
that what you do is repeat a simple process many times instead of doing
a more complex process once.

   </p>
<p>For example, instead of adding up all the pebbles all at once, what you
can do is add the number of pebbles in the first row, 1, to the number
in the second row, 2, and then add the total of those two rows to the
third row, 3.  Then you can add the number in the fourth row, 4, to the
total of the first three rows; and so on.

   </p>
<p>The critical characteristic of the process is that each repetitive
action is simple.  In this case, at each step we add only two numbers,
the number of pebbles in the row and the total already found.  This
process of adding two numbers is repeated again and again until the last
row has been added to the total of all the preceding rows.  In a more
complex loop the repetitive action might not be so simple, but it will
be simpler than doing everything all at once.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Inc-Example-parts"></a></div>

<h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">The parts of the function definition</h5>

<p>The preceding analysis gives us the bones of our function definition:
first, we will need a variable that we can call <code>total</code> that will
be the total number of pebbles.  This will be the value returned by
the function.

   </p>
<p>Second, we know that the function will require an argument: this
argument will be the total number of rows in the triangle.  It can be
called <code>number-of-rows</code>.

   </p>
<p>Finally, we need a variable to use as a counter.  We could call this
variable <code>counter</code>, but a better name is <code>row-number</code>.  That
is because what the counter does in this function is count rows, and a
program should be written to be as understandable as possible.

   </p>
<p>When the Lisp interpreter first starts evaluating the expressions in the
function, the value of <code>total</code> should be set to zero, since we have
not added anything to it.  Then the function should add the number of
pebbles in the first row to the total, and then add the number of
pebbles in the second to the total, and then add the number of
pebbles in the third row to the total, and so on, until there are no
more rows left to add.

   </p>
<p>Both <code>total</code> and <code>row-number</code> are used only inside the
function, so they can be declared as local variables with <code>let</code>
and given initial values.  Clearly, the initial value for <code>total</code>
should be 0.  The initial value of <code>row-number</code> should be 1,
since we start with the first row.  This means that the <code>let</code>
statement will look like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">       (let ((total 0)
             (row-number 1))
         <var>body</var>...)
</pre>
   <p>After the internal variables are declared and bound to their initial
values, we can begin the <code>while</code> loop.  The expression that serves
as the test should return a value of <code>t</code> for true so long as the
<code>row-number</code> is less than or equal to the <code>number-of-rows</code>. 
(If the expression tests true only so long as the row number is less
than the number of rows in the triangle, the last row will never be
added to the total; hence the row number has to be either less than or
equal to the number of rows.)

   </p>
<p><a name="index-g_t_003c_003d-_0040r_007b_0028less-than-or-equal_0029_007d-232"></a>Lisp provides the <code>&lt;=</code> function that returns true if the value of
its first argument is less than or equal to the value of its second
argument and false otherwise.  So the expression that the <code>while</code>
will evaluate as its test should look like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (&lt;= row-number number-of-rows)
</pre>
   <p>The total number of pebbles can be found by repeatedly adding the number
of pebbles in a row to the total already found.  Since the number of
pebbles in the row is equal to the row number, the total can be found by
adding the row number to the total.  (Clearly, in a more complex
situation, the number of pebbles in the row might be related to the row
number in a more complicated way; if this were the case, the row number
would be replaced by the appropriate expression.)

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setq total (+ total row-number))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">What this does is set the new value of <code>total</code> to be equal to the
sum of adding the number of pebbles in the row to the previous total.

   </p>
<p>After setting the value of <code>total</code>, the conditions need to be
established for the next repetition of the loop, if there is one.  This
is done by incrementing the value of the <code>row-number</code> variable,
which serves as a counter.  After the <code>row-number</code> variable has
been incremented, the true-or-false-test at the beginning of the
<code>while</code> loop tests whether its value is still less than or equal to
the value of the <code>number-of-rows</code> and if it is, adds the new value
of the <code>row-number</code> variable to the <code>total</code> of the previous
repetition of the loop.

   </p>
<p>The built-in Emacs Lisp function <code>1+</code> adds 1 to a number, so the
<code>row-number</code> variable can be incremented with this expression:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setq row-number (1+ row-number))
</pre>
   <div class="node"><a name="Inc-Example-altogether"></a></div>

<h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">Putting the function definition together</h5>

<p>We have created the parts for the function definition; now we need to
put them together.

   </p>
<p>First, the contents of the <code>while</code> expression:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (while (&lt;= row-number number-of-rows)   ; <span class="roman">true-or-false-test</span>
       (setq total (+ total row-number))
       (setq row-number (1+ row-number)))    ; <span class="roman">incrementer</span>
</pre>
   <p>Along with the <code>let</code> expression varlist, this very nearly
completes the body of the function definition.  However, it requires
one final element, the need for which is somewhat subtle.

   </p>
<p>The final touch is to place the variable <code>total</code> on a line by
itself after the <code>while</code> expression.  Otherwise, the value returned
by the whole function is the value of the last expression that is
evaluated in the body of the <code>let</code>, and this is the value
returned by the <code>while</code>, which is always <code>nil</code>.

   </p>
<p>This may not be evident at first sight.  It almost looks as if the
incrementing expression is the last expression of the whole function. 
But that expression is part of the body of the <code>while</code>; it is the
last element of the list that starts with the symbol <code>while</code>. 
Moreover, the whole of the <code>while</code> loop is a list within the body
of the <code>let</code>.

   </p>
<p>In outline, the function will look like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun <var>name-of-function</var> (<var>argument-list</var>)
       "<var>documentation</var>..."
       (let (<var>varlist</var>)
         (while (<var>true-or-false-test</var>)
           <var>body-of-while</var>... )
         ... ))                    ; <span class="roman">Need final expression here.</span>
</pre>
   <p>The result of evaluating the <code>let</code> is what is going to be returned
by the <code>defun</code> since the <code>let</code> is not embedded within any
containing list, except for the <code>defun</code> as a whole.  However, if
the <code>while</code> is the last element of the <code>let</code> expression, the
function will always return <code>nil</code>.  This is not what we want! 
Instead, what we want is the value of the variable <code>total</code>.  This
is returned by simply placing the symbol as the last element of the list
starting with <code>let</code>.  It gets evaluated after the preceding
elements of the list are evaluated, which means it gets evaluated after
it has been assigned the correct value for the total.

   </p>
<p>It may be easier to see this by printing the list starting with
<code>let</code> all on one line.  This format makes it evident that the
<var>varlist</var> and <code>while</code> expressions are the second and third
elements of the list starting with <code>let</code>, and the <code>total</code> is
the last element:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (let (<var>varlist</var>) (while (<var>true-or-false-test</var>) <var>body-of-while</var>... ) total)
</pre>
   <p>Putting everything together, the <code>triangle</code> function definition
looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun triangle (number-of-rows)    ; <span class="roman">Version with</span>
                                         ; <span class="roman">  incrementing counter.</span>
       "Add up the number of pebbles in a triangle.
     The first row has one pebble, the second row two pebbles,
     the third row three pebbles, and so on.
     The argument is NUMBER-OF-ROWS."
       (let ((total 0)
             (row-number 1))
         (while (&lt;= row-number number-of-rows)
           (setq total (+ total row-number))
           (setq row-number (1+ row-number)))
         total))
</pre>
   <p>After you have installed <code>triangle</code> by evaluating the function, you
can try it out.  Here are two examples:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (triangle 4)
     
     (triangle 7)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The sum of the first four numbers is 10 and the sum of the first seven
numbers is 28.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Decrementing-Loop"></a></div>

<h4 class="subsection">11.1.4 Loop with a Decrementing Counter</h4>

<p>Another common way to write a <code>while</code> loop is to write the test
so that it determines whether a counter is greater than zero.  So long
as the counter is greater than zero, the loop is repeated.  But when
the counter is equal to or less than zero, the loop is stopped.  For
this to work, the counter has to start out greater than zero and then
be made smaller and smaller by a form that is evaluated
repeatedly.

   </p>
<p>The test will be an expression such as <code>(&gt; counter 0)</code> which
returns <code>t</code> for true if the value of <code>counter</code> is greater
than zero, and <code>nil</code> for false if the value of <code>counter</code> is
equal to or less than zero.  The expression that makes the number
smaller and smaller can be a simple <code>setq</code> such as <code>(setq
counter (1- counter))</code>, where <code>1-</code> is a built-in function in
Emacs Lisp that subtracts 1 from its argument.

   </p>
<p>The template for a decrementing <code>while</code> loop looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (while (&gt; counter 0)                    ; <span class="roman">true-or-false-test</span>

<h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">Example with decrementing counter</h5>

<p>To illustrate a loop with a decrementing counter, we will rewrite the
<code>triangle</code> function so the counter decreases to zero.

   </p>
<p>This is the reverse of the earlier version of the function.  In this
case, to find out how many pebbles are needed to make a triangle with
3 rows, add the number of pebbles in the third row, 3, to the number
in the preceding row, 2, and then add the total of those two rows to
the row that precedes them, which is 1.

   </p>
<p>Likewise, to find the number of pebbles in a triangle with 7 rows, add
the number of pebbles in the seventh row, 7, to the number in the
preceding row, which is 6, and then add the total of those two rows to
the row that precedes them, which is 5, and so on.  As in the previous
example, each addition only involves adding two numbers, the total of
the rows already added up and the number of pebbles in the row that is
being added to the total.  This process of adding two numbers is
repeated again and again until there are no more pebbles to add.

   </p>
<p>We know how many pebbles to start with: the number of pebbles in the
last row is equal to the number of rows.  If the triangle has seven
rows, the number of pebbles in the last row is 7.  Likewise, we know how
many pebbles are in the preceding row: it is one less than the number in
the row.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Dec-Example-parts"></a></div>

<h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">The parts of the function definition</h5>

<p>We start with three variables: the total number of rows in the
triangle; the number of pebbles in a row; and the total number of
pebbles, which is what we want to calculate.  These variables can be
named <code>number-of-rows</code>, <code>number-of-pebbles-in-row</code>, and
<code>total</code>, respectively.

   </p>
<p>Both <code>total</code> and <code>number-of-pebbles-in-row</code> are used only
inside the function and are declared with <code>let</code>.  The initial
value of <code>total</code> should, of course, be zero.  However, the
initial value of <code>number-of-pebbles-in-row</code> should be equal to
the number of rows in the triangle, since the addition will start with
the longest row.

   </p>
<p>This means that the beginning of the <code>let</code> expression will look
like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (let ((total 0)
           (number-of-pebbles-in-row number-of-rows))
       <var>body</var>...)
</pre>
   <p>The total number of pebbles can be found by repeatedly adding the number
of pebbles in a row to the total already found, that is, by repeatedly
evaluating the following expression:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setq total (+ total number-of-pebbles-in-row))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">After the <code>number-of-pebbles-in-row</code> is added to the <code>total</code>,
the <code>number-of-pebbles-in-row</code> should be decremented by one, since
the next time the loop repeats, the preceding row will be
added to the total.

   </p>
<p>The number of pebbles in a preceding row is one less than the number of
pebbles in a row, so the built-in Emacs Lisp function <code>1-</code> can be
used to compute the number of pebbles in the preceding row.  This can be
done with the following expression:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setq number-of-pebbles-in-row
           (1- number-of-pebbles-in-row))
</pre>
   <p>Finally, we know that the <code>while</code> loop should stop making repeated
additions when there are no pebbles in a row.  So the test for
the <code>while</code> loop is simply:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (while (&gt; number-of-pebbles-in-row 0)
</pre>
   <div class="node"><a name="Dec-Example-altogether"></a></div>

<h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">Putting the function definition together</h5>

<p>We can put these expressions together to create a function definition
that works.  However, on examination, we find that one of the local
variables is unneeded!

   </p>
<p>The function definition looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ;;; <span class="roman">First subtractive version.</span>
     (defun triangle (number-of-rows)
       "Add up the number of pebbles in a triangle."
       (let ((total 0)
             (number-of-pebbles-in-row number-of-rows))
         (while (&gt; number-of-pebbles-in-row 0)
           (setq total (+ total number-of-pebbles-in-row))
           (setq number-of-pebbles-in-row
                 (1- number-of-pebbles-in-row)))
         total))
</pre>
   <p>As written, this function works.

   </p>
<p>However, we do not need <code>number-of-pebbles-in-row</code>.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-Argument-as-local-variable-233"></a>When the <code>triangle</code> function is evaluated, the symbol
<code>number-of-rows</code> will be bound to a number, giving it an initial
value.  That number can be changed in the body of the function as if
it were a local variable, without any fear that such a change will
effect the value of the variable outside of the function.  This is a
very useful characteristic of Lisp; it means that the variable
<code>number-of-rows</code> can be used anywhere in the function where
<code>number-of-pebbles-in-row</code> is used.

   </p>
<p>Here is a second version of the function written a bit more cleanly:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun triangle (number)                ; <span class="roman">Second version.</span>
       "Return sum of numbers 1 through NUMBER inclusive."
       (let ((total 0))
         (while (&gt; number 0)
           (setq total (+ total number))
           (setq number (1- number)))
         total))
</pre>
   <p>In brief, a properly written <code>while</code> loop will consist of three parts:

     </p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>A test that will return false after the loop has repeated itself the
correct number of times.

     </li>
<li>An expression the evaluation of which will return the value desired
after being repeatedly evaluated.

     </li>
<li>An expression to change the value passed to the true-or-false-test so
that the test returns false after the loop has repeated itself the right
number of times.
        </li>
</ol>

<h3 class="section">11.2 Save your time: <code>dolist</code> and <code>dotimes</code>
</h3>

<p>In addition to <code>while</code>, both <code>dolist</code> and <code>dotimes</code>
provide for looping.  Sometimes these are quicker to write than the
equivalent <code>while</code> loop.  Both are Lisp macros.  (See <a href="elisp.html#Macros">Macros</a>. )

   </p>
<p><code>dolist</code> works like a <code>while</code> loop that <span class="sc">cdr</span>s down a
list:  <code>dolist</code> automatically shortens the list each time it
loops—takes the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of the list—and binds the <span class="sc">car</span> of
each shorter version of the list to the first of its arguments.

   </p>
<p><code>dotimes</code> loops a specific number of times: you specify the number.

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">The <code>dolist</code> Macro</h4>

<p><a name="index-dolist-234"></a>
Suppose, for example, you want to reverse a list, so that
“first” “second” “third” becomes “third” “second” “first”.

   </p>
<p>In practice, you would use the <code>reverse</code> function, like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setq animals '(gazelle giraffe lion tiger))
     
     (reverse animals)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here is how you could reverse the list using a <code>while</code> loop:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setq animals '(gazelle giraffe lion tiger))
     
     (defun reverse-list-with-while (list)
       "Using while, reverse the order of LIST."
       (let (value)  ; make sure list starts empty
         (while list
           (setq value (cons (car list) value))
           (setq list (cdr list)))
         value))
     
     (reverse-list-with-while animals)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">And here is how you could use the <code>dolist</code> macro:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setq animals '(gazelle giraffe lion tiger))
     
     (defun reverse-list-with-dolist (list)
       "Using dolist, reverse the order of LIST."
       (let (value)  ; make sure list starts empty
         (dolist (element list value)
           (setq value (cons element value)))))
     
     (reverse-list-with-dolist animals)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In Info, you can place your cursor after the closing parenthesis of
each expression and type <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>; in each case, you should see

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (tiger lion giraffe gazelle)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">in the echo area.

   </p>
<p>For this example, the existing <code>reverse</code> function is obviously best. 
The <code>while</code> loop is just like our first example (see <a href="#Loop-Example">A <code>while</code> Loop and a List</a>).  The <code>while</code> first
checks whether the list has elements; if so, it constructs a new list
by adding the first element of the list to the existing list (which in
the first iteration of the loop is <code>nil</code>).  Since the second
element is prepended in front of the first element, and the third
element is prepended in front of the second element, the list is reversed.

   </p>
<p>In the expression using a <code>while</code> loop,
the <code>(setq list (cdr list))</code><!-- /@w -->
expression shortens the list, so the <code>while</code> loop eventually
stops.  In addition, it provides the <code>cons</code> expression with a new
first element by creating a new and shorter list at each repetition of
the loop.

   </p>
<p>The <code>dolist</code> expression does very much the same as the
<code>while</code> expression, except that the <code>dolist</code> macro does some
of the work you have to do when writing a <code>while</code> expression.

   </p>
<p>Like a <code>while</code> loop, a <code>dolist</code> loops.  What is different is
that it automatically shortens the list each time it loops—it
<span class="sc">cdr</span>s down the list on its own—and it automatically binds
the <span class="sc">car</span> of each shorter version of the list to the first of its
arguments.

   </p>
<p>In the example, the <span class="sc">car</span> of each shorter version of the list is
referred to using the symbol `<samp><span class="samp">element</span></samp>', the list itself is called
`<samp><span class="samp">list</span></samp>', and the value returned is called `<samp><span class="samp">value</span></samp>'.  The
remainder of the <code>dolist</code> expression is the body.

   </p>
<p>The <code>dolist</code> expression binds the <span class="sc">car</span> of each shorter
version of the list to <code>element</code> and then evaluates the body of
the expression; and repeats the loop.  The result is returned in
<code>value</code>.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="dotimes"></a></div>

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">The <code>dotimes</code> Macro</h4>

<p><a name="index-dotimes-235"></a>
The <code>dotimes</code> macro is similar to <code>dolist</code>, except that it
loops a specific number of times.

   </p>
<p>The first argument to <code>dotimes</code> is assigned the numbers 0, 1, 2
and so forth each time around the loop, and the value of the third
argument is returned.  You need to provide the value of the second
argument, which is how many times the macro loops.

   </p>
<p>For example, the following binds the numbers from 0 up to, but not
including, the number 3 to the first argument, <var>number</var>, and then
constructs a list of the three numbers.  (The first number is 0, the
second number is 1, and the third number is 2; this makes a total of
three numbers in all, starting with zero as the first number.)

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (let (value)      ; otherwise a value is a void variable
       (dotimes (number 3 value)
         (setq value (cons number value))))
     
     =&gt; (2 1 0)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><code>dotimes</code> returns <code>value</code>, so the way to use
<code>dotimes</code> is to operate on some expression <var>number</var> number of
times and then return the result, either as a list or an atom.

   </p>
<p>Here is an example of a <code>defun</code> that uses <code>dotimes</code> to add
up the number of pebbles in a triangle.

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun triangle-using-dotimes (number-of-rows)
       "Using `dotimes', add up the number of pebbles in a triangle."
     (let ((total 0))  ; otherwise a total is a void variable
       (dotimes (number number-of-rows total)
         (setq total (+ total (1+ number))))))

<h3 class="section">11.3 Recursion</h3>

<p><a name="index-Recursion-236"></a>
A recursive function contains code that tells the Lisp interpreter to
call a program that runs exactly like itself, but with slightly
different arguments.  The code runs exactly the same because it has
the same name.  However, even though the program has the same name, it
is not the same entity.  It is different.  In the jargon, it is a
different “instance”.

   </p>
<p>Eventually, if the program is written correctly, the slightly
different arguments will become sufficiently different from the first
arguments that the final instance will stop.

<h4 class="subsection">11.3.1 Building Robots: Extending the Metaphor</h4>

<p><a name="index-Building-robots-237"></a><a name="index-Robots_002c-building-238"></a>
It is sometimes helpful to think of a running program as a robot that
does a job.  In doing its job, a recursive function calls on a second
robot to help it.  The second robot is identical to the first in every
way, except that the second robot helps the first and has been
passed different arguments than the first.

   </p>
<p>In a recursive function, the second robot may call a third; and the
third may call a fourth, and so on.  Each of these is a different
entity; but all are clones.

   </p>
<p>Since each robot has slightly different instructions—the arguments
will differ from one robot to the next—the last robot should know
when to stop.

   </p>
<p>Let's expand on the metaphor in which a computer program is a robot.

   </p>
<p>A function definition provides the blueprints for a robot.  When you
install a function definition, that is, when you evaluate a
<code>defun</code> macro, you install the necessary equipment to build
robots.  It is as if you were in a factory, setting up an assembly
line.  Robots with the same name are built according to the same
blueprints.  So they have the same model number, but a
different serial number.

   </p>
<p>We often say that a recursive function “calls itself”.  What we mean
is that the instructions in a recursive function cause the Lisp
interpreter to run a different function that has the same name and
does the same job as the first, but with different arguments.

   </p>
<p>It is important that the arguments differ from one instance to the
next; otherwise, the process will never stop.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Recursive-Definition-Parts"></a></div>

<h4 class="subsection">11.3.2 The Parts of a Recursive Definition</h4>

<p><a name="index-Parts-of-a-Recursive-Definition-239"></a><a name="index-Recursive-Definition-Parts-240"></a>
A recursive function typically contains a conditional expression which
has three parts:

     </p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>A true-or-false-test that determines whether the function is called
again, here called the <dfn>do-again-test</dfn>.

     </li>
<li>The name of the function.  When this name is called, a new instance of
the function—a new robot, as it were—is created and told what to do.

     </li>
<li>An expression that returns a different value each time the function is
called, here called the <dfn>next-step-expression</dfn>.  Consequently, the
argument (or arguments) passed to the new instance of the function
will be different from that passed to the previous instance.  This
causes the conditional expression, the <dfn>do-again-test</dfn>, to test
false after the correct number of repetitions.
        </li>
</ol>

   <p>Recursive functions can be much simpler than any other kind of
function.  Indeed, when people first start to use them, they often look
so mysteriously simple as to be incomprehensible.  Like riding a
bicycle, reading a recursive function definition takes a certain knack
which is hard at first but then seems simple.

   </p>
<p>There are several different common recursive patterns.  A very simple
pattern looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun <var>name-of-recursive-function</var> (<var>argument-list</var>)
       "<var>documentation</var>..."
       (if <var>do-again-test</var>
         <var>body</var>...
         (<var>name-of-recursive-function</var>
              <var>next-step-expression</var>)))
</pre>
   <p>Each time a recursive function is evaluated, a new instance of it is
created and told what to do.  The arguments tell the instance what to do.

   </p>
<p>An argument is bound to the value of the next-step-expression.  Each
instance runs with a different value of the next-step-expression.

   </p>
<p>The value in the next-step-expression is used in the do-again-test.

   </p>
<p>The value returned by the next-step-expression is passed to the new
instance of the function, which evaluates it (or some
transmogrification of it) to determine whether to continue or stop. 
The next-step-expression is designed so that the do-again-test returns
false when the function should no longer be repeated.

   </p>
<p>The do-again-test is sometimes called the <dfn>stop condition</dfn>,
since it stops the repetitions when it tests false.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Recursion-with-list"></a></div>

<h4 class="subsection">11.3.3 Recursion with a List</h4>

<p>The example of a <code>while</code> loop that printed the elements of a list
of numbers can be written recursively.  Here is the code, including
an expression to set the value of the variable <code>animals</code> to a list.

   </p>
<p>If you are reading this in Info in Emacs, you can evaluate this
expression directly in Info.  Otherwise, you must copy the example
to the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer and evaluate each expression there. 
Use <kbd>C-u C-x C-e</kbd> to evaluate the
<code>(print-elements-recursively animals)</code> expression so that the
results are printed in the buffer; otherwise the Lisp interpreter will
try to squeeze the results into the one line of the echo area.

   </p>
<p>Also, place your cursor immediately after the last closing parenthesis
of the <code>print-elements-recursively</code> function, before the comment. 
Otherwise, the Lisp interpreter will try to evaluate the comment.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-print_002delements_002drecursively-241"></a>
</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setq animals '(gazelle giraffe lion tiger))
     
     (defun print-elements-recursively (list)
       "Print each element of LIST on a line of its own.
     Uses recursion."
       (when list                            ; <span class="roman">do-again-test</span>
             (print (car list))              ; <span class="roman">body</span>
             (print-elements-recursively     ; <span class="roman">recursive call</span>
              (cdr list))))                  ; <span class="roman">next-step-expression</span>
     
     (print-elements-recursively animals)
</pre>
   <p>The <code>print-elements-recursively</code> function first tests whether
there is any content in the list; if there is, the function prints the
first element of the list, the <span class="sc">car</span> of the list.  Then the
function invokes itself, but gives itself as its argument, not the
whole list, but the second and subsequent elements of the list, the
<span class="sc">cdr</span> of the list.

   </p>
<p>Put another way, if the list is not empty, the function invokes
another instance of code that is similar to the initial code, but is a
different thread of execution, with different arguments than the first
instance.

   </p>
<p>Put in yet another way, if the list is not empty, the first robot
assembles a second robot and tells it what to do; the second robot is
a different individual from the first, but is the same model.

   </p>
<p>When the second evaluation occurs, the <code>when</code> expression is
evaluated and if true, prints the first element of the list it
receives as its argument (which is the second element of the original
list).  Then the function calls itself with the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of the list
it is invoked with, which (the second time around) is the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of
the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of the original list.

   </p>
<p>Note that although we say that the function “calls itself”, what we
mean is that the Lisp interpreter assembles and instructs a new
instance of the program.  The new instance is a clone of the first,
but is a separate individual.

   </p>
<p>Each time the function invokes itself, it does so on a
shorter version of the original list.  It creates a new instance that
works on a shorter list.

   </p>
<p>Eventually, the function invokes itself on an empty list.  It creates
a new instance whose argument is <code>nil</code>.  The conditional expression
tests the value of <code>list</code>.  Since the value of <code>list</code> is
<code>nil</code>, the <code>when</code> expression tests false so the then-part is
not evaluated.  The function as a whole then returns <code>nil</code>.

   </p>
<p>When you evaluate the expression <code>(print-elements-recursively
animals)</code> in the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer, you see this result:

<h4 class="subsection">11.3.4 Recursion in Place of a Counter</h4>

<p><a name="index-triangle_002drecursively-242"></a>
The <code>triangle</code> function described in a previous section can also
be written recursively.  It looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun triangle-recursively (number)
       "Return the sum of the numbers 1 through NUMBER inclusive.
     Uses recursion."
       (if (= number 1)                    ; <span class="roman">do-again-test</span>

     (triangle-recursively 7)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You can install this function by evaluating it and then try it by
evaluating <code>(triangle-recursively 7)</code>.  (Remember to put your
cursor immediately after the last parenthesis of the function
definition, before the comment.)  The function evaluates to 28.

   </p>
<p>To understand how this function works, let's consider what happens in the
various cases when the function is passed 1, 2, 3, or 4 as the value of
its argument.

</p>
<ul class="menu">
<li>
<a accesskey="1" href="#Recursive-Example-arg-of-1-or-2">Recursive Example arg of 1 or 2</a>
</li>
<li>
<a accesskey="2" href="#Recursive-Example-arg-of-3-or-4">Recursive Example arg of 3 or 4</a>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="node"><a name="Recursive-Example-arg-of-1-or-2"></a></div>

<h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">An argument of 1 or 2</h5>

   <p>First, what happens if the value of the argument is 1?

   </p>
<p>The function has an <code>if</code> expression after the documentation
string.  It tests whether the value of <code>number</code> is equal to 1; if
so, Emacs evaluates the then-part of the <code>if</code> expression, which
returns the number 1 as the value of the function.  (A triangle with
one row has one pebble in it.)

   </p>
<p>Suppose, however, that the value of the argument is 2.  In this case,
Emacs evaluates the else-part of the <code>if</code> expression.

   </p>
<p>The else-part consists of an addition, the recursive call to
<code>triangle-recursively</code> and a decrementing action; and it looks like
this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (+ number (triangle-recursively (1- number)))
</pre>
   <p>When Emacs evaluates this expression, the innermost expression is
evaluated first; then the other parts in sequence.  Here are the steps
in detail:

     </p>
<dl>
<dt><i>Step 1   <!-- /@w --> Evaluate the innermost expression.</i></dt>
<dd>
The innermost expression is <code>(1- number)</code> so Emacs decrements the
value of <code>number</code> from 2 to 1.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>
<i>Step 2   <!-- /@w --> Evaluate the </i><code>triangle-recursively</code><i> function.</i>
</dt>
<dd>
The Lisp interpreter creates an individual instance of
<code>triangle-recursively</code>.  It does not matter that this function is
contained within itself.  Emacs passes the result Step 1 as the
argument used by this instance of the <code>triangle-recursively</code>
function

     <p>In this case, Emacs evaluates <code>triangle-recursively</code> with an
argument of 1.  This means that this evaluation of
<code>triangle-recursively</code> returns 1.

     <br></p>
</dd>
<dt>
<i>Step 3   <!-- /@w --> Evaluate the value of </i><code>number</code><i>.</i>
</dt>
<dd>
The variable <code>number</code> is the second element of the list that
starts with <code>+</code>; its value is 2.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>
<i>Step 4   <!-- /@w --> Evaluate the </i><code>+</code><i> expression.</i>
</dt>
<dd>
The <code>+</code> expression receives two arguments, the first
from the evaluation of <code>number</code> (Step 3) and the second from the
evaluation of <code>triangle-recursively</code> (Step 2).

     <p>The result of the addition is the sum of 2 plus 1, and the number 3 is
returned, which is correct.  A triangle with two rows has three
pebbles in it.

<div class="node"><a name="Recursive-Example-arg-of-3-or-4"></a></div>

<h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">An argument of 3 or 4</h5>

<p>Suppose that <code>triangle-recursively</code> is called with an argument of
3.

     </p>
<dl>
<dt><i>Step 1   <!-- /@w --> Evaluate the do-again-test.</i></dt>
<dd>
The <code>if</code> expression is evaluated first.  This is the do-again
test and returns false, so the else-part of the <code>if</code> expression
is evaluated.  (Note that in this example, the do-again-test causes
the function to call itself when it tests false, not when it tests
true.)

     <br>
</dd>
<dt><i>Step 2   <!-- /@w --> Evaluate the innermost expression of the else-part.</i></dt>
<dd>
The innermost expression of the else-part is evaluated, which decrements
3 to 2.  This is the next-step-expression.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt>
<i>Step 3   <!-- /@w --> Evaluate the </i><code>triangle-recursively</code><i> function.</i>
</dt>
<dd>
The number 2 is passed to the <code>triangle-recursively</code> function.

     <p>We already know what happens when Emacs evaluates <code>triangle-recursively</code> with
an argument of 2.  After going through the sequence of actions described
earlier, it returns a value of 3.  So that is what will happen here.

     <br></p>
</dd>
<dt><i>Step 4   <!-- /@w --> Evaluate the addition.</i></dt>
<dd>
3 will be passed as an argument to the addition and will be added to the
number with which the function was called, which is 3. 
</dd>
</dl>

<p class="noindent">The value returned by the function as a whole will be 6.

   </p>
<p>Now that we know what will happen when <code>triangle-recursively</code> is
called with an argument of 3, it is evident what will happen if it is
called with an argument of 4:

   </p>
<blockquote>
In the recursive call, the evaluation of

     <pre class="smallexample">          (triangle-recursively (1- 4))
     </pre>
        <p class="noindent">will return the value of evaluating

     </p>
<pre class="smallexample">          (triangle-recursively 3)
     </pre>
        <p class="noindent">which is 6 and this value will be added to 4 by the addition in the
third line. 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">The value returned by the function as a whole will be 10.

   </p>
<p>Each time <code>triangle-recursively</code> is evaluated, it evaluates a
version of itself—a different instance of itself—with a smaller
argument, until the argument is small enough so that it does not
evaluate itself.

   </p>
<p>Note that this particular design for a recursive function
requires that operations be deferred.

   </p>
<p>Before <code>(triangle-recursively 7)</code> can calculate its answer, it
must call <code>(triangle-recursively 6)</code>; and before
<code>(triangle-recursively 6)</code> can calculate its answer, it must call
<code>(triangle-recursively 5)</code>; and so on.  That is to say, the
calculation that <code>(triangle-recursively 7)</code> makes must be
deferred until <code>(triangle-recursively 6)</code> makes its calculation;
and <code>(triangle-recursively 6)</code> must defer until
<code>(triangle-recursively 5)</code> completes; and so on.

   </p>
<p>If each of these instances of <code>triangle-recursively</code> are thought
of as different robots, the first robot must wait for the second to
complete its job, which must wait until the third completes, and so
on.

   </p>
<p>There is a way around this kind of waiting, which we will discuss in
<a href="#No-Deferment">Recursion without Deferments</a>.

<h4 class="subsection">11.3.5 Recursion Example Using <code>cond</code>
</h4>

<p><a name="index-cond-243"></a>
The version of <code>triangle-recursively</code> described earlier is written
with the <code>if</code> special form.  It can also be written using another
special form called <code>cond</code>.  The name of the special form
<code>cond</code> is an abbreviation of the word `<samp><span class="samp">conditional</span></samp>'.

   </p>
<p>Although the <code>cond</code> special form is not used as often in the
Emacs Lisp sources as <code>if</code>, it is used often enough to justify
explaining it.

   </p>
<p>The template for a <code>cond</code> expression looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (cond
      <var>body</var>...)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where the <var>body</var> is a series of lists.

   </p>
<p>Written out more fully, the template looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (cond
      (<var>first-true-or-false-test</var> <var>first-consequent</var>)
      (<var>second-true-or-false-test</var> <var>second-consequent</var>)
      (<var>third-true-or-false-test</var> <var>third-consequent</var>)
       ...)
</pre>
   <p>When the Lisp interpreter evaluates the <code>cond</code> expression, it
evaluates the first element (the <span class="sc">car</span> or true-or-false-test) of
the first expression in a series of expressions within the body of the
<code>cond</code>.

   </p>
<p>If the true-or-false-test returns <code>nil</code> the rest of that
expression, the consequent, is skipped and  the true-or-false-test of the
next expression is evaluated.  When an expression is found whose
true-or-false-test returns a value that is not <code>nil</code>, the
consequent of that expression is evaluated.  The consequent can be one
or more expressions.  If the consequent consists of more than one
expression, the expressions are evaluated in sequence and the value of
the last one is returned.  If the expression does not have a consequent,
the value of the true-or-false-test is returned.

   </p>
<p>If none of the true-or-false-tests test true, the <code>cond</code> expression
returns <code>nil</code>.

   </p>
<p>Written using <code>cond</code>, the <code>triangle</code> function looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun triangle-using-cond (number)
       (cond ((&lt;= number 0) 0)
             ((= number 1) 1)
             ((&gt; number 1)
              (+ number (triangle-using-cond (1- number))))))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this example, the <code>cond</code> returns 0 if the number is less than or
equal to 0, it returns 1 if the number is 1 and it evaluates <code>(+
number (triangle-using-cond (1- number)))</code> if the number is greater than
1.

<div class="node"><a name="Recursive-Patterns"></a></div>

<h4 class="subsection">11.3.6 Recursive Patterns</h4>

<p><a name="index-Recursive-Patterns-244"></a>
Here are three common recursive patterns.  Each involves a list. 
Recursion does not need to involve lists, but Lisp is designed for lists
and this provides a sense of its primal capabilities.

</p>
<ul class="menu">
<li>
<a accesskey="1" href="#Every">Every</a>
</li>
<li>
<a accesskey="2" href="#Accumulate">Accumulate</a>
</li>
<li>
<a accesskey="3" href="#Keep">Keep</a>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="node"><a name="Every"></a></div>

<h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">Recursive Pattern: <em>every</em>
</h5>

<p><a name="index-Every_002c-type-of-recursive-pattern-245"></a><a name="index-Recursive-pattern-_002d-every-246"></a>
In the <code>every</code> recursive pattern, an action is performed on every
element of a list.

   </p>
<p>The basic pattern is:

     </p>
<ul>
<li>If a list be empty, return <code>nil</code>. 
</li>
<li>Else, act on the beginning of the list (the <span class="sc">car</span> of the list)
          <ul>
    <li>    through a recursive call by the function on the rest (the
    <span class="sc">cdr</span>) of the list,
    </li>
<li>    and, optionally, combine the acted-on element, using <code>cons</code>,
    with the results of acting on the rest. 
    </li>
</ul>
     </li>
</ul>

   <p>Here is an example:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun square-each (numbers-list)
       "Square each of a NUMBERS LIST, recursively."
       (if (not numbers-list)                ; do-again-test
           nil
         (cons
          (* (car numbers-list) (car numbers-list))
          (square-each (cdr numbers-list))))) ; next-step-expression
     
     (square-each '(1 2 3))
         =&gt; (1 4 9)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If <code>numbers-list</code> is empty, do nothing.  But if it has content,
construct a list combining the square of the first number in the list
with the result of the recursive call.

   </p>
<p>(The example follows the pattern exactly: <code>nil</code> is returned if
the numbers' list is empty.  In practice, you would write the
conditional so it carries out the action when the numbers' list is not
empty.)

   </p>
<p>The <code>print-elements-recursively</code> function (see <a href="#Recursion-with-list">Recursion with a List</a>) is another example of an <code>every</code>
pattern, except in this case, rather than bring the results together
using <code>cons</code>, we print each element of output.

   </p>
<p>The <code>print-elements-recursively</code> function looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setq animals '(gazelle giraffe lion tiger))
     
     (defun print-elements-recursively (list)
       "Print each element of LIST on a line of its own.
     Uses recursion."
       (when list                            ; <span class="roman">do-again-test</span>
             (print (car list))              ; <span class="roman">body</span>
             (print-elements-recursively     ; <span class="roman">recursive call</span>
              (cdr list))))                  ; <span class="roman">next-step-expression</span>
     
     (print-elements-recursively animals)
</pre>
   <p>The pattern for <code>print-elements-recursively</code> is:

     </p>
<ul>
<li>When the list is empty, do nothing. 
</li>
<li>But when the list has at least one element,
          <ul>
    <li>    act on the beginning of the list (the <span class="sc">car</span> of the list),
    </li>
<li>    and make a recursive call on the rest (the <span class="sc">cdr</span>) of the list. 
    </li>
</ul>
     </li>
</ul>

<div class="node"><a name="Accumulate"></a></div>

<h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">Recursive Pattern: <em>accumulate</em>
</h5>

<p><a name="index-Accumulate_002c-type-of-recursive-pattern-247"></a><a name="index-Recursive-pattern-_002d-accumulate-248"></a>
Another recursive pattern is called the <code>accumulate</code> pattern.  In
the <code>accumulate</code> recursive pattern, an action is performed on
every element of a list and the result of that action is accumulated
with the results of performing the action on the other elements.

   </p>
<p>This is very like the <code>every</code> pattern using <code>cons</code>, except that
<code>cons</code> is not used, but some other combiner.

   </p>
<p>The pattern is:

     </p>
<ul>
<li>If a list be empty, return zero or some other constant. 
</li>
<li>Else, act on the beginning of the list (the <span class="sc">car</span> of the list),
          <ul>
    <li>    and combine that acted-on element, using <code>+</code> or
    some other combining function, with
    </li>
<li>    a recursive call by the function on the rest (the <span class="sc">cdr</span>) of the list. 
    </li>
</ul>
     </li>
</ul>

   <p>Here is an example:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun add-elements (numbers-list)
       "Add the elements of NUMBERS-LIST together."
       (if (not numbers-list)
           0
         (+ (car numbers-list) (add-elements (cdr numbers-list)))))
     
     (add-elements '(1 2 3 4))
         =&gt; 10
</pre>
   <p>See <a href="#Files-List">Making a List of Files</a>, for an example of the
accumulate pattern.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Keep"></a></div>

<h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">Recursive Pattern: <em>keep</em>
</h5>

<p><a name="index-Keep_002c-type-of-recursive-pattern-249"></a><a name="index-Recursive-pattern-_002d-keep-250"></a>
A third recursive pattern is called the <code>keep</code> pattern. 
In the <code>keep</code> recursive pattern, each element of a list is tested;
the element is acted on and the results are kept only if the element
meets a criterion.

   </p>
<p>Again, this is very like the <code>every</code> pattern, except the element is
skipped unless it meets a criterion.

   </p>
<p>The pattern has three parts:

     </p>
<ul>
<li>If a list be empty, return <code>nil</code>. 
</li>
<li>Else, if the beginning of the list (the <span class="sc">car</span> of the list) passes
        a test
          <ul>
    <li>    act on that element and combine it, using <code>cons</code> with
    </li>
<li>    a recursive call by the function on the rest (the <span class="sc">cdr</span>) of the list. 
    </li>
</ul>
     </li>
<li>Otherwise, if the beginning of the list (the <span class="sc">car</span> of the list) fails
the test
          <ul>
    <li>    skip on that element,
    </li>
<li>    and, recursively call the function on the rest (the <span class="sc">cdr</span>) of the list. 
    </li>
</ul>
     </li>
</ul>

   <p>Here is an example that uses <code>cond</code>:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun keep-three-letter-words (word-list)
       "Keep three letter words in WORD-LIST."
       (cond
        ;; First do-again-test: stop-condition
        ((not word-list) nil)
     
        ;; Second do-again-test: when to act
        ((eq 3 (length (symbol-name (car word-list))))
         ;; combine acted-on element with recursive call on shorter list
         (cons (car word-list) (keep-three-letter-words (cdr word-list))))
     
        ;; Third do-again-test: when to skip element;
        ;;   recursively call shorter list with next-step expression
        (t (keep-three-letter-words (cdr word-list)))))
     
     (keep-three-letter-words '(one two three four five six))
         =&gt; (one two six)
</pre>
   <p>It goes without saying that you need not use <code>nil</code> as the test for
when to stop; and you can, of course, combine these patterns.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="No-Deferment"></a></div>

<h4 class="subsection">11.3.7 Recursion without Deferments</h4>

<p><a name="index-Deferment-in-recursion-251"></a><a name="index-Recursion-without-Deferments-252"></a>
Let's consider again what happens with the <code>triangle-recursively</code>
function.  We will find that the intermediate calculations are
deferred until all can be done.

   </p>
<p>Here is the function definition:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun triangle-recursively (number)
       "Return the sum of the numbers 1 through NUMBER inclusive.
     Uses recursion."
       (if (= number 1)                    ; <span class="roman">do-again-test</span>
           1                               ; <span class="roman">then-part</span>
         (+ number                         ; <span class="roman">else-part</span>
            (triangle-recursively          ; <span class="roman">recursive call</span>
             (1- number)))))               ; <span class="roman">next-step-expression</span>
</pre>
   <p>What happens when we call this function with a argument of 7?

   </p>
<p>The first instance of the <code>triangle-recursively</code> function adds
the number 7 to the value returned by a second instance of
<code>triangle-recursively</code>, an instance that has been passed an
argument of 6.  That is to say, the first calculation is:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (+ 7 (triangle-recursively 6))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The first instance of <code>triangle-recursively</code>—you may want to
think of it as a little robot—cannot complete its job.  It must hand
off the calculation for <code>(triangle-recursively 6)</code> to a second
instance of the program, to a second robot.  This second individual is
completely different from the first one; it is, in the jargon, a
“different instantiation”.  Or, put another way, it is a different
robot.  It is the same model as the first; it calculates triangle
numbers recursively; but it has a different serial number.

   </p>
<p>And what does <code>(triangle-recursively 6)</code> return?  It returns the
number 6 added to the value returned by evaluating
<code>triangle-recursively</code> with an argument of 5.  Using the robot
metaphor, it asks yet another robot to help it.

   </p>
<p>Now the total is:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (+ 7 6 (triangle-recursively 5))
</pre>
   <p>And what happens next?

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (+ 7 6 5 (triangle-recursively 4))
</pre>
   <p>Each time <code>triangle-recursively</code> is called, except for the last
time, it creates another instance of the program—another robot—and
asks it to make a calculation.

   </p>
<p>Eventually, the full addition is set up and performed:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (+ 7 6 5 4 3 2 1)
</pre>
   <p>This design for the function defers the calculation of the first step
until the second can be done, and defers that until the third can be
done, and so on.  Each deferment means the computer must remember what
is being waited on.  This is not a problem when there are only a few
steps, as in this example.  But it can be a problem when there are
more steps.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="No-deferment-solution"></a></div>

<h4 class="subsection">11.3.8 No Deferment Solution</h4>

<p><a name="index-No-deferment-solution-253"></a><a name="index-Solution-without-deferment-254"></a>
The solution to the problem of deferred operations is to write in a
manner that does not defer operations<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-12" name="fnd-12"><sup>12</sup></a>.  This requires
writing to a different pattern, often one that involves writing two
function definitions, an initialization function and a helper
function.

   </p>
<p>The initialization function sets up the job; the helper function
does the work.

   </p>
<p>Here are the two function definitions for adding up numbers.  They are
so simple, I find them hard to understand.

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun triangle-initialization (number)
       "Return the sum of the numbers 1 through NUMBER inclusive.
     This is the initialization component of a two function
     duo that uses recursion."
       (triangle-recursive-helper 0 0 number))
</pre>
   <pre class="smallexample">     (defun triangle-recursive-helper (sum counter number)
       "Return SUM, using COUNTER, through NUMBER inclusive.
     This is the helper component of a two function duo
     that uses recursion."
       (if (&gt; counter number)
           sum
         (triangle-recursive-helper (+ sum counter)  ; <span class="roman">sum</span>
                                    (1+ counter)     ; <span class="roman">counter</span>
                                    number)))        ; <span class="roman">number</span>
</pre>
   <p>Install both function definitions by evaluating them, then call
<code>triangle-initialization</code> with 2 rows:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (triangle-initialization 2)
         =&gt; 3
</pre>
   <p>The initialization function calls the first instance of the helper
function with three arguments: zero, zero, and a number which is the
number of rows in the triangle.

   </p>
<p>The first two arguments passed to the helper function are
initialization values.  These values are changed when
<code>triangle-recursive-helper</code> invokes new instances.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-13" name="fnd-13"><sup>13</sup></a>

   </p>
<p>Let's see what happens when we have a triangle that has one row.  (This
triangle will have one pebble in it!)

   </p>
<p><code>triangle-initialization</code> will call its helper with
the arguments <code>0 0 1</code><!-- /@w -->.  That function will run the conditional
test whether <code>(&gt; counter number)</code>:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (&gt; 0 1)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and find that the result is false, so it will invoke
the else-part of the <code>if</code> clause:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">         (triangle-recursive-helper
          (+ sum counter)  ; <span class="roman">sum plus counter</span> =&gt; <span class="roman">sum</span>
          (1+ counter)     ; <span class="roman">increment counter</span> =&gt; <span class="roman">counter</span>
          number)          ; <span class="roman">number stays the same</span>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which will first compute:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (triangle-recursive-helper (+ 0 0)  ; <span class="roman">sum</span>
                                (1+ 0)   ; <span class="roman">counter</span>
                                1)       ; <span class="roman">number</span>
<br>which is:<br>
     
     (triangle-recursive-helper 0 1 1)
</pre>
   <p>Again, <code>(&gt; counter number)</code> will be false, so again, the Lisp
interpreter will evaluate <code>triangle-recursive-helper</code>, creating a
new instance with new arguments.

   </p>
<p>This new instance will be;

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">         (triangle-recursive-helper
          (+ sum counter)  ; <span class="roman">sum plus counter</span> =&gt; <span class="roman">sum</span>
          (1+ counter)     ; <span class="roman">increment counter</span> =&gt; <span class="roman">counter</span>
          number)          ; <span class="roman">number stays the same</span>
     
<br>which is:<br>
     
     (triangle-recursive-helper 1 2 1)
</pre>
   <p>In this case, the <code>(&gt; counter number)</code> test will be true!  So the
instance will return the value of the sum, which will be 1, as
expected.

   </p>
<p>Now, let's pass <code>triangle-initialization</code> an argument
of 2, to find out how many pebbles there are in a triangle with two rows.

   </p>
<p>That function calls <code>(triangle-recursive-helper 0 0 2)</code>.

   </p>
<p>In stages, the instances called will be:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">                               <span class="roman">sum counter number</span>
     (triangle-recursive-helper 0    1       2)
     
     (triangle-recursive-helper 1    2       2)
     
     (triangle-recursive-helper 3    3       2)
</pre>
   <p>When the last instance is called, the <code>(&gt; counter number)</code> test
will be true, so the instance will return the value of <code>sum</code>,
which will be 3.

   </p>
<p>This kind of pattern helps when you are writing functions that can use
many resources in a computer.

Regular expression searches are used extensively in GNU Emacs.  The
two functions, <code>forward-sentence</code> and <code>forward-paragraph</code>,
illustrate these searches well.  They use regular expressions to find
where to move point.  The phrase “regular expression” is often written
as “regexp”.

   </p>
<p>Regular expression searches are described in <a href="emacs.html#Regexp-Search">Regular Expression Search</a>, as well as in
<a href="elisp.html#Regular-Expressions">Regular Expressions</a>.  In writing this chapter, I am presuming that you have at
least a mild acquaintance with them.  The major point to remember is
that regular expressions permit you to search for patterns as well as
for literal strings of characters.  For example, the code in
<code>forward-sentence</code> searches for the pattern of possible
characters that could mark the end of a sentence, and moves point to
that spot.

   </p>
<p>Before looking at the code for the <code>forward-sentence</code> function, it
is worth considering what the pattern that marks the end of a sentence
must be.  The pattern is discussed in the next section; following that
is a description of the regular expression search function,
<code>re-search-forward</code>.  The <code>forward-sentence</code> function
is described in the section following.  Finally, the
<code>forward-paragraph</code> function is described in the last section of
this chapter.  <code>forward-paragraph</code> is a complex function that
introduces several new features.

<h3 class="section">12.1 The Regular Expression for <code>sentence-end</code>
</h3>

<p><a name="index-sentence_002dend-261"></a>
The symbol <code>sentence-end</code> is bound to the pattern that marks the
end of a sentence.  What should this regular expression be?

   </p>
<p>Clearly, a sentence may be ended by a period, a question mark, or an
exclamation mark.  Indeed, in English, only clauses that end with one
of those three characters should be considered the end of a sentence. 
This means that the pattern should include the character set:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     [.?!]
</pre>
   <p>However, we do not want <code>forward-sentence</code> merely to jump to a
period, a question mark, or an exclamation mark, because such a character
might be used in the middle of a sentence.  A period, for example, is
used after abbreviations.  So other information is needed.

   </p>
<p>According to convention, you type two spaces after every sentence, but
only one space after a period, a question mark, or an exclamation mark in
the body of a sentence.  So a period, a question mark, or an exclamation
mark followed by two spaces is a good indicator of an end of sentence. 
However, in a file, the two spaces may instead be a tab or the end of a
line.  This means that the regular expression should include these three
items as alternatives.

   </p>
<p>This group of alternatives will look like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     \\($\\| \\|  \\)
            ^   ^^
           TAB  SPC
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here, `<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>' indicates the end of the line, and I have pointed out
where the tab and two spaces are inserted in the expression.  Both are
inserted by putting the actual characters into the expression.

   </p>
<p>Two backslashes, `<samp><span class="samp">\\</span></samp>', are required before the parentheses and
vertical bars: the first backslash quotes the following backslash in
Emacs; and the second indicates that the following character, the
parenthesis or the vertical bar, is special.

   </p>
<p>Also, a sentence may be followed by one or more carriage returns, like
this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     [
     ]*
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Like tabs and spaces, a carriage return is inserted into a regular
expression by inserting it literally.  The asterisk indicates that the
&lt;RET&gt; is repeated zero or more times.

   </p>
<p>But a sentence end does not consist only of a period, a question mark or
an exclamation mark followed by appropriate space: a closing quotation
mark or a closing brace of some kind may precede the space.  Indeed more
than one such mark or brace may precede the space.  These require a
expression that looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     []\"')}]*
</pre>
   <p>In this expression, the first `<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>' is the first character in the
expression; the second character is `<samp><span class="samp">"</span></samp>', which is preceded by a
`<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>' to tell Emacs the `<samp><span class="samp">"</span></samp>' is <em>not</em> special.  The last
three characters are `<samp><span class="samp">'</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">)</span></samp>', and `<samp><span class="samp">}</span></samp>'.

   </p>
<p>All this suggests what the regular expression pattern for matching the
end of a sentence should be; and, indeed, if we evaluate
<code>sentence-end</code> we find that it returns the following value:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     sentence-end
          =&gt; "[.?!][]\"')}]*\\($\\|     \\|  \\)[
     ]*"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(Well, not in GNU Emacs 22; that is because of an effort to make the
process simpler and to handle more glyphs and languages.  When the
value of <code>sentence-end</code> is <code>nil</code>, then use the value defined
by the function <code>sentence-end</code>.  (Here is a use of the difference
between a value and a function in Emacs Lisp.)  The function returns a
value constructed from the variables <code>sentence-end-base</code>,
<code>sentence-end-double-space</code>, <code>sentence-end-without-period</code>,
and <code>sentence-end-without-space</code>.  The critical variable is
<code>sentence-end-base</code>; its global value is similar to the one
described above but it also contains two additional quotation marks. 
These have differing degrees of curliness.  The
<code>sentence-end-without-period</code> variable, when true, tells Emacs
that a sentence may end without a period, such as text in Thai.)

<h3 class="section">12.2 The <code>re-search-forward</code> Function</h3>

<p><a name="index-re_002dsearch_002dforward-262"></a>
The <code>re-search-forward</code> function is very like the
<code>search-forward</code> function.  (See <a href="#search_002dforward">The <code>search-forward</code> Function</a>.)

   </p>
<p><code>re-search-forward</code> searches for a regular expression.  If the
search is successful, it leaves point immediately after the last
character in the target.  If the search is backwards, it leaves point
just before the first character in the target.  You may tell
<code>re-search-forward</code> to return <code>t</code> for true.  (Moving point
is therefore a side effect.)

   </p>
<p>Like <code>search-forward</code>, the <code>re-search-forward</code> function takes
four arguments:

     </p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>The first argument is the regular expression that the function searches
for.  The regular expression will be a string between quotation marks.

     </li>
<li>The optional second argument limits how far the function will search; it is a
bound, which is specified as a position in the buffer.

     </li>
<li>The optional third argument specifies how the function responds to
failure: <code>nil</code> as the third argument causes the function to
signal an error (and print a message) when the search fails; any other
value causes it to return <code>nil</code> if the search fails and <code>t</code>
if the search succeeds.

     </li>
<li>The optional fourth argument is the repeat count.  A negative repeat
count causes <code>re-search-forward</code> to search backwards.
        </li>
</ol>

   <p>The template for <code>re-search-forward</code> looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (re-search-forward "<var>regular-expression</var>"
                     <var>limit-of-search</var>
                     <var>what-to-do-if-search-fails</var>
                     <var>repeat-count</var>)
</pre>
   <p>The second, third, and fourth arguments are optional.  However, if you
want to pass a value to either or both of the last two arguments, you
must also pass a value to all the preceding arguments.  Otherwise, the
Lisp interpreter will mistake which argument you are passing the value
to.

   </p>
<p>In the <code>forward-sentence</code> function, the regular expression will be
the value of the variable <code>sentence-end</code>.  In simple form, that is:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     "[.?!][]\"')}]*\\($\\|  \\|  \\)[
     ]*"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The limit of the search will be the end of the paragraph (since a
sentence cannot go beyond a paragraph).  If the search fails, the
function will return <code>nil</code>; and the repeat count will be provided
by the argument to the <code>forward-sentence</code> function.

The command to move the cursor forward a sentence is a straightforward
illustration of how to use regular expression searches in Emacs Lisp. 
Indeed, the function looks longer and more complicated than it is; this
is because the function is designed to go backwards as well as forwards;
and, optionally, over more than one sentence.  The function is usually
bound to the key command <kbd>M-e</kbd>.

   <p>Here is the code for <code>forward-sentence</code>:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun forward-sentence (&amp;optional arg)
       "Move forward to next end of sentence.  With argument, repeat.

       (or arg (setq arg 1))

            (if (and (re-search-backward sentence-end par-beg t)
                     (or (&lt; (match-end 0) pos)

              (goto-char par-beg)))
           (setq arg (1+ arg)))
         (while (&gt; arg 0)
           (let ((par-end (save-excursion (end-of-paragraph-text) (point))))
            (if (re-search-forward sentence-end par-end t)
                (skip-chars-backward " \t\n")
              (goto-char par-end)))
           (setq arg (1- arg)))
         (constrain-to-field nil opoint t)))
</pre>
   <p>The function looks long at first sight and it is best to look at its
skeleton first, and then its muscle.  The way to see the skeleton is to
look at the expressions that start in the left-most columns:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun forward-sentence (&amp;optional arg)
       "<var>documentation</var>..."
       (interactive "p")
       (or arg (setq arg 1))
       (let ((opoint (point)) (sentence-end (sentence-end)))
         (while (&lt; arg 0)
           (let ((pos (point))
                 (par-beg (save-excursion (start-of-paragraph-text) (point))))
            <var>rest-of-body-of-while-loop-when-going-backwards</var>
         (while (&gt; arg 0)
           (let ((par-end (save-excursion (end-of-paragraph-text) (point))))
            <var>rest-of-body-of-while-loop-when-going-forwards</var>
         <var>handle-forms-and-equivalent</var>
</pre>
   <p>This looks much simpler!  The function definition consists of
documentation, an <code>interactive</code> expression, an <code>or</code>
expression, a <code>let</code> expression, and <code>while</code> loops.

   </p>
<p>Let's look at each of these parts in turn.

   </p>
<p>We note that the documentation is thorough and understandable.

   </p>
<p>The function has an <code>interactive "p"</code> declaration.  This means
that the processed prefix argument, if any, is passed to the
function as its argument.  (This will be a number.)  If the function
is not passed an argument (it is optional) then the argument
<code>arg</code> will be bound to 1.

   </p>
<p>When <code>forward-sentence</code> is called non-interactively without an
argument, <code>arg</code> is bound to <code>nil</code>.  The <code>or</code> expression
handles this.  What it does is either leave the value of <code>arg</code> as
it is, but only if <code>arg</code> is bound to a value; or it sets the
value of <code>arg</code> to 1, in the case when <code>arg</code> is bound to
<code>nil</code>.

   </p>
<p>Next is a <code>let</code>.  That specifies the values of two local
variables, <code>opoint</code> and <code>sentence-end</code>.  The local value of
point, from before the search, is used in the
<code>constrain-to-field</code> function which handles forms and
equivalents.  The <code>sentence-end</code> variable is set by the
<code>sentence-end</code> function.

</p>
<div class="node">
<a name="fwd-sentence-while-loops"></a><a name="fwd_002dsentence-while-loops"></a>
</div>

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">The <code>while</code> loops</h4>

<p>Two <code>while</code> loops follow.  The first <code>while</code> has a
true-or-false-test that tests true if the prefix argument for
<code>forward-sentence</code> is a negative number.  This is for going
backwards.  The body of this loop is similar to the body of the second
<code>while</code> clause, but it is not exactly the same.  We will skip
this <code>while</code> loop and concentrate on the second <code>while</code>
loop.

   </p>
<p>The second <code>while</code> loop is for moving point forward.  Its skeleton
looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (while (&gt; arg 0)            ; <span class="roman">true-or-false-test</span>
       (let <var>varlist</var>
         (if (<var>true-or-false-test</var>)
             <var>then-part</var>
           <var>else-part</var>
       (setq arg (1- arg))))     ; <code>while</code> <span class="roman">loop decrementer</span>
</pre>
   <p>The <code>while</code> loop is of the decrementing kind. 
(See <a href="#Decrementing-Loop">A Loop with a Decrementing Counter</a>.)  It
has a true-or-false-test that tests true so long as the counter (in
this case, the variable <code>arg</code>) is greater than zero; and it has a
decrementer that subtracts 1 from the value of the counter every time
the loop repeats.

   </p>
<p>If no prefix argument is given to <code>forward-sentence</code>, which is
the most common way the command is used, this <code>while</code> loop will
run once, since the value of <code>arg</code> will be 1.

   </p>
<p>The body of the <code>while</code> loop consists of a <code>let</code> expression,
which creates and binds a local variable, and has, as its body, an
<code>if</code> expression.

   </p>
<p>The body of the <code>while</code> loop looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (let ((par-end
            (save-excursion (end-of-paragraph-text) (point))))
       (if (re-search-forward sentence-end par-end t)
           (skip-chars-backward " \t\n")
         (goto-char par-end)))
</pre>
   <p>The <code>let</code> expression creates and binds the local variable
<code>par-end</code>.  As we shall see, this local variable is designed to
provide a bound or limit to the regular expression search.  If the
search fails to find a proper sentence ending in the paragraph, it will
stop on reaching the end of the paragraph.

   </p>
<p>But first, let us examine how <code>par-end</code> is bound to the value of
the end of the paragraph.  What happens is that the <code>let</code> sets the
value of <code>par-end</code> to the value returned when the Lisp interpreter
evaluates the expression

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (save-excursion (end-of-paragraph-text) (point))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this expression, <code>(end-of-paragraph-text)</code> moves point to the
end of the paragraph, <code>(point)</code> returns the value of point, and then
<code>save-excursion</code> restores point to its original position.  Thus,
the <code>let</code> binds <code>par-end</code> to the value returned by the
<code>save-excursion</code> expression, which is the position of the end of
the paragraph.  (The <code>end-of-paragraph-text</code> function uses
<code>forward-paragraph</code>, which we will discuss shortly.)

   </p>
<p>Emacs next evaluates the body of the <code>let</code>, which is an <code>if</code>
expression that looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (if (re-search-forward sentence-end par-end t) ; <span class="roman">if-part</span>
         (skip-chars-backward " \t\n")              ; <span class="roman">then-part</span>
       (goto-char par-end)))                        ; <span class="roman">else-part</span>
</pre>
   <p>The <code>if</code> tests whether its first argument is true and if so,
evaluates its then-part; otherwise, the Emacs Lisp interpreter
evaluates the else-part.  The true-or-false-test of the <code>if</code>
expression is the regular expression search.

   </p>
<p>It may seem odd to have what looks like the real work of
the <code>forward-sentence</code> function buried here, but this is a common
way this kind of operation is carried out in Lisp.

<div class="node">
<a name="fwd-sentence-re-search"></a><a name="fwd_002dsentence-re_002dsearch"></a>
</div>

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">The regular expression search</h4>

<p>The <code>re-search-forward</code> function searches for the end of the
sentence, that is, for the pattern defined by the <code>sentence-end</code>
regular expression.  If the pattern is found—if the end of the sentence is
found—then the <code>re-search-forward</code> function does two things:

     </p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>The <code>re-search-forward</code> function carries out a side effect, which
is to move point to the end of the occurrence found.

     </li>
<li>The <code>re-search-forward</code> function returns a value of true.  This is
the value received by the <code>if</code>, and means that the search was
successful.
        </li>
</ol>

<p class="noindent">The side effect, the movement of point, is completed before the
<code>if</code> function is handed the value returned by the successful
conclusion of the search.

   </p>
<p>When the <code>if</code> function receives the value of true from a successful
call to <code>re-search-forward</code>, the <code>if</code> evaluates the then-part,
which is the expression <code>(skip-chars-backward " \t\n")</code>.  This
expression moves backwards over any blank spaces, tabs or carriage
returns until a printed character is found and then leaves point after
the character.  Since point has already been moved to the end of the
pattern that marks the end of the sentence, this action leaves point
right after the closing printed character of the sentence, which is
usually a period.

   </p>
<p>On the other hand, if the <code>re-search-forward</code> function fails to
find a pattern marking the end of the sentence, the function returns
false.  The false then causes the <code>if</code> to evaluate its third
argument, which is <code>(goto-char par-end)</code>:  it moves point to the
end of the paragraph.

   </p>
<p>(And if the text is in a form or equivalent, and point may not move
fully, then the <code>constrain-to-field</code> function comes into play.)

   </p>
<p>Regular expression searches are exceptionally useful and the pattern
illustrated by <code>re-search-forward</code>, in which the search is the
test of an <code>if</code> expression, is handy.  You will see or write code
incorporating this pattern often.

<h3 class="section">12.4 <code>forward-paragraph</code>: a Goldmine of Functions</h3>

<p><a name="index-forward_002dparagraph-264"></a>

   </p>
<p>The <code>forward-paragraph</code> function moves point forward to the end
of the paragraph.  It is usually bound to <kbd>M-}</kbd> and makes use of a
number of functions that are important in themselves, including
<code>let*</code>, <code>match-beginning</code>, and <code>looking-at</code>.

   </p>
<p>The function definition for <code>forward-paragraph</code> is considerably
longer than the function definition for <code>forward-sentence</code>
because it works with a paragraph, each line of which may begin with a
fill prefix.

   </p>
<p>A fill prefix consists of a string of characters that are repeated at
the beginning of each line.  For example, in Lisp code, it is a
convention to start each line of a paragraph-long comment with
`<samp><span class="samp">;;; </span></samp>'.  In Text mode, four blank spaces make up another common
fill prefix, creating an indented paragraph.  (See <a href="emacs.html#Fill-Prefix">Fill Prefix</a>, for more information about fill
prefixes.)

   </p>
<p>The existence of a fill prefix means that in addition to being able to
find the end of a paragraph whose lines begin on the left-most
column, the <code>forward-paragraph</code> function must be able to find the
end of a paragraph when all or many of the lines in the buffer begin
with the fill prefix.

   </p>
<p>Moreover, it is sometimes practical to ignore a fill prefix that
exists, especially when blank lines separate paragraphs. 
This is an added complication.

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Shortened <code>forward-paragraph</code> function definition</h4>

   <p>Rather than print all of the <code>forward-paragraph</code> function, we
will only print parts of it.  Read without preparation, the function
can be daunting!

   </p>
<p>In outline, the function looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun forward-paragraph (&amp;optional arg)
       "<var>documentation</var>..."
       (interactive "p")
       (or arg (setq arg 1))
       (let*
           <var>varlist</var>
         (while (and (&lt; arg 0) (not (bobp)))     ; <span class="roman">backward-moving-code</span>
           ...
         (while (and (&gt; arg 0) (not (eobp)))     ; <span class="roman">forward-moving-code</span>
           ...
</pre>
   <p>The first parts of the function are routine: the function's argument
list consists of one optional argument.  Documentation follows.

   </p>
<p>The lower case `<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>' in the <code>interactive</code> declaration means
that the processed prefix argument, if any, is passed to the function. 
This will be a number, and is the repeat count of how many paragraphs
point will move.  The <code>or</code> expression in the next line handles
the common case when no argument is passed to the function, which occurs
if the function is called from other code rather than interactively. 
This case was described earlier.  (See <a href="#forward_002dsentence">The <code>forward-sentence</code> function</a>.)  Now we reach the end of the
familiar part of this function.

</p>
<div class="node">
<a name="fwd-para-let"></a><a name="fwd_002dpara-let"></a>
</div>

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">The <code>let*</code> expression</h4>

<p>The next line of the <code>forward-paragraph</code> function begins a
<code>let*</code> expression.  This is a different than <code>let</code>.  The
symbol is <code>let*</code> not <code>let</code>.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-let_002a-265"></a>The <code>let*</code> special form is like <code>let</code> except that Emacs sets
each variable in sequence, one after another, and variables in the
latter part of the varlist can make use of the values to which Emacs
set variables in the earlier part of the varlist.

   </p>
<p>(<a href="#append-save_002dexcursion"><code>save-excursion</code> in <code>append-to-buffer</code></a>.)

   </p>
<p>In the <code>let*</code> expression in this function, Emacs binds a total of
seven variables:  <code>opoint</code>, <code>fill-prefix-regexp</code>,
<code>parstart</code>, <code>parsep</code>, <code>sp-parstart</code>, <code>start</code>, and
<code>found-start</code>.

   </p>
<p>The variable <code>parsep</code> appears twice, first, to remove instances
of `<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>', and second, to handle fill prefixes.

   </p>
<p>The variable <code>opoint</code> is just the value of <code>point</code>.  As you
can guess, it is used in a <code>constrain-to-field</code> expression, just
as in <code>forward-sentence</code>.

   </p>
<p>The variable <code>fill-prefix-regexp</code> is set to the value returned by
evaluating the following list:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (and fill-prefix
          (not (equal fill-prefix ""))
          (not paragraph-ignore-fill-prefix)
          (regexp-quote fill-prefix))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This is an expression whose first element is the <code>and</code> special form.

   </p>
<p>As we learned earlier (see <a href="#kill_002dnew-function">The <code>kill-new</code> function</a>), the <code>and</code> special form evaluates each of its
arguments until one of the arguments returns a value of <code>nil</code>, in
which case the <code>and</code> expression returns <code>nil</code>; however, if
none of the arguments returns a value of <code>nil</code>, the value
resulting from evaluating the last argument is returned.  (Since such
a value is not <code>nil</code>, it is considered true in Lisp.)  In other
words, an <code>and</code> expression returns a true value only if all its
arguments are true. 
<a name="index-and-266"></a>
In this case, the variable <code>fill-prefix-regexp</code> is bound to a
non-<code>nil</code> value only if the following four expressions produce a
true (i.e., a non-<code>nil</code>) value when they are evaluated; otherwise,
<code>fill-prefix-regexp</code> is bound to <code>nil</code>.

     </p>
<dl>
<dt><code>fill-prefix</code></dt>
<dd>When this variable is evaluated, the value of the fill prefix, if any,
is returned.  If there is no fill prefix, this variable returns
<code>nil</code>.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>(not (equal fill-prefix "")</code></dt>
<dd>This expression checks whether an existing fill prefix is an empty
string, that is, a string with no characters in it.  An empty string is
not a useful fill prefix.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>(not paragraph-ignore-fill-prefix)</code></dt>
<dd>This expression returns <code>nil</code> if the variable
<code>paragraph-ignore-fill-prefix</code> has been turned on by being set to a
true value such as <code>t</code>.

     <br>
</dd>
<dt><code>(regexp-quote fill-prefix)</code></dt>
<dd>This is the last argument to the <code>and</code> special form.  If all the
arguments to the <code>and</code> are true, the value resulting from
evaluating this expression will be returned by the <code>and</code> expression
and bound to the variable <code>fill-prefix-regexp</code>,
</dd>
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-regexp_002dquote-267"></a>The result of evaluating this <code>and</code> expression successfully is that
<code>fill-prefix-regexp</code> will be bound to the value of
<code>fill-prefix</code> as modified by the <code>regexp-quote</code> function. 
What <code>regexp-quote</code> does is read a string and return a regular
expression that will exactly match the string and match nothing else. 
This means that <code>fill-prefix-regexp</code> will be set to a value that
will exactly match the fill prefix if the fill prefix exists. 
Otherwise, the variable will be set to <code>nil</code>.

   </p>
<p>The next two local variables in the <code>let*</code> expression are
designed to remove instances of `<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>' from <code>parstart</code> and
<code>parsep</code>, the local variables which indicate the paragraph start
and the paragraph separator.  The next expression sets <code>parsep</code>
again.  That is to handle fill prefixes.

   </p>
<p>This is the setting that requires the definition call <code>let*</code>
rather than <code>let</code>.  The true-or-false-test for the <code>if</code>
depends on whether the variable <code>fill-prefix-regexp</code> evaluates to
<code>nil</code> or some other value.

   </p>
<p>If <code>fill-prefix-regexp</code> does not have a value, Emacs evaluates
the else-part of the <code>if</code> expression and binds <code>parsep</code> to
its local value.  (<code>parsep</code> is a regular expression that matches
what separates paragraphs.)

   </p>
<p>But if <code>fill-prefix-regexp</code> does have a value, Emacs evaluates
the then-part of the <code>if</code> expression and binds <code>parsep</code> to a
regular expression that includes the <code>fill-prefix-regexp</code> as part
of the pattern.

   </p>
<p>Specifically, <code>parsep</code> is set to the original value of the
paragraph separate regular expression concatenated with an alternative
expression that consists of the <code>fill-prefix-regexp</code> followed by
optional whitespace to the end of the line.  The whitespace is defined
by <code>"[ \t]*$"</code><!-- /@w -->.)  The `<samp><span class="samp">\\|</span></samp>' defines this portion of the
regexp as an alternative to <code>parsep</code>.

   </p>
<p>According to a comment in the code, the next local variable,
<code>sp-parstart</code>, is used for searching, and then the final two,
<code>start</code> and <code>found-start</code>, are set to <code>nil</code>.

   </p>
<p>Now we get into the body of the <code>let*</code>.  The first part of the body
of the <code>let*</code> deals with the case when the function is given a
negative argument and is therefore moving backwards.  We will skip this
section.

</p>
<div class="node">
<a name="fwd-para-while"></a><a name="fwd_002dpara-while"></a>
</div>

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">The forward motion <code>while</code> loop</h4>

<p>The second part of the body of the <code>let*</code> deals with forward
motion.  It is a <code>while</code> loop that repeats itself so long as the
value of <code>arg</code> is greater than zero.  In the most common use of
the function, the value of the argument is 1, so the body of the
<code>while</code> loop is evaluated exactly once, and the cursor moves
forward one paragraph.

   </p>
<p>This part handles three situations: when point is between paragraphs,
when there is a fill prefix and when there is no fill prefix.

   </p>
<p>The <code>while</code> loop looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ;; <span class="roman">going forwards and not at the end of the buffer</span>
     (while (and (&gt; arg 0) (not (eobp)))
     
       ;; <span class="roman">between paragraphs</span>
       ;; Move forward over separator lines...
       (while (and (not (eobp))
                   (progn (move-to-left-margin) (not (eobp)))
                   (looking-at parsep))
         (forward-line 1))
       ;;  <span class="roman">This decrements the loop</span>
       (unless (eobp) (setq arg (1- arg)))
       ;; ... and one more line.
       (forward-line 1)
     
       (if fill-prefix-regexp
           ;; There is a fill prefix; it overrides parstart;
           ;; we go forward line by line
           (while (and (not (eobp))
                       (progn (move-to-left-margin) (not (eobp)))
                       (not (looking-at parsep))
                       (looking-at fill-prefix-regexp))
             (forward-line 1))
     
         ;; There is no fill prefix;
         ;; we go forward character by character
         (while (and (re-search-forward sp-parstart nil 1)
                     (progn (setq start (match-beginning 0))
                            (goto-char start)
                            (not (eobp)))
                     (progn (move-to-left-margin)
                            (not (looking-at parsep)))
                     (or (not (looking-at parstart))
                         (and use-hard-newlines
                              (not (get-text-property (1- start) 'hard)))))
           (forward-char 1))
     
         ;; and if there is no fill prefix and if we are not at the end,
         ;;     go to whatever was found in the regular expression search
         ;;     for sp-parstart
         (if (&lt; (point) (point-max))
             (goto-char start))))
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-eobp-268"></a>We can see that this is a decrementing counter <code>while</code> loop,
using the expression <code>(setq arg (1- arg))</code> as the decrementer. 
That expression is not far from the <code>while</code>, but is hidden in
another Lisp macro, an <code>unless</code> macro.  Unless we are at the end
of the buffer—that is what the <code>eobp</code> function determines; it
is an abbreviation of `<samp><span class="samp">End Of Buffer P</span></samp>'—we decrease the value
of <code>arg</code> by one.

   </p>
<p>(If we are at the end of the buffer, we cannot go forward any more and
the next loop of the <code>while</code> expression will test false since the
test is an <code>and</code> with <code>(not (eobp))</code>.  The <code>not</code>
function means exactly as you expect; it is another name for
<code>null</code>, a function that returns true when its argument is false.)

   </p>
<p>Interestingly, the loop count is not decremented until we leave the
space between paragraphs, unless we come to the end of buffer or stop
seeing the local value of the paragraph separator.

   </p>
<p>That second <code>while</code> also has a <code>(move-to-left-margin)</code>
expression.  The function is self-explanatory.  It is inside a
<code>progn</code> expression and not the last element of its body, so it is
only invoked for its side effect, which is to move point to the left
margin of the current line.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-looking_002dat-269"></a>The <code>looking-at</code> function is also self-explanatory; it returns
true if the text after point matches the regular expression given as
its argument.

   </p>
<p>The rest of the body of the loop looks difficult at first, but makes
sense as you come to understand it.

   </p>
<p>First consider what happens if there is a fill prefix:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">       (if fill-prefix-regexp
           ;; There is a fill prefix; it overrides parstart;
           ;; we go forward line by line
           (while (and (not (eobp))
                       (progn (move-to-left-margin) (not (eobp)))
                       (not (looking-at parsep))
                       (looking-at fill-prefix-regexp))
             (forward-line 1))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This expression moves point forward line by line so long
as four conditions are true:

     </p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Point is not at the end of the buffer.

     </li>
<li>We can move to the left margin of the text and are
not at the end of the buffer.

     </li>
<li>The text following point does not separate paragraphs.

     </li>
<li>The pattern following point is the fill prefix regular expression.
        </li>
</ol>

   <p>The last condition may be puzzling, until you remember that point was
moved to the beginning of the line early in the <code>forward-paragraph</code>
function.  This means that if the text has a fill prefix, the
<code>looking-at</code> function will see it.

   </p>
<p>Consider what happens when there is no fill prefix.

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">         (while (and (re-search-forward sp-parstart nil 1)
                     (progn (setq start (match-beginning 0))
                            (goto-char start)
                            (not (eobp)))
                     (progn (move-to-left-margin)
                            (not (looking-at parsep)))
                     (or (not (looking-at parstart))
                         (and use-hard-newlines
                              (not (get-text-property (1- start) 'hard)))))
           (forward-char 1))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This <code>while</code> loop has us searching forward for
<code>sp-parstart</code>, which is the combination of possible whitespace
with the local value of the start of a paragraph or of a paragraph
separator.  (The latter two are within an expression starting
<code>\(?:</code> so that they are not referenced by the
<code>match-beginning</code> function.)

   </p>
<p>The two expressions,

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setq start (match-beginning 0))
     (goto-char start)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">mean go to the start of the text matched by the regular expression
search.

   </p>
<p>The <code>(match-beginning 0)</code> expression is new.  It returns a number
specifying the location of the start of the text that was matched by
the last search.

   </p>
<p>The <code>match-beginning</code> function is used here because of a
characteristic of a forward search: a successful forward search,
regardless of whether it is a plain search or a regular expression
search, moves point to the end of the text that is found.  In this
case, a successful search moves point to the end of the pattern for
<code>sp-parstart</code>.

   </p>
<p>However, we want to put point at the end of the current paragraph, not
somewhere else.  Indeed, since the search possibly includes the
paragraph separator, point may end up at the beginning of the next one
unless we use an expression that includes <code>match-beginning</code>.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-match_002dbeginning-270"></a>When given an argument of 0, <code>match-beginning</code> returns the
position that is the start of the text matched by the most recent
search.  In this case, the most recent search looks for
<code>sp-parstart</code>.  The <code>(match-beginning 0)</code> expression returns
the beginning position of that pattern, rather than the end position
of that pattern.

   </p>
<p>(Incidentally, when passed a positive number as an argument, the
<code>match-beginning</code> function returns the location of point at that
parenthesized expression in the last search unless that parenthesized
expression begins with <code>\(?:</code>.  I don't know why <code>\(?:</code>
appears here since the argument is 0.)

   </p>
<p>The last expression when there is no fill prefix is

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (if (&lt; (point) (point-max))
         (goto-char start))))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This says that if there is no fill prefix and if we are not at the
end, point should move to the beginning of whatever was found by the
regular expression search for <code>sp-parstart</code>.

   </p>
<p>The full definition for the <code>forward-paragraph</code> function not only
includes code for going forwards, but also code for going backwards.

   </p>
<p>If you are reading this inside of GNU Emacs and you want to see the
whole function, you can type <kbd>C-h f</kbd> (<code>describe-function</code>)
and the name of the function.  This gives you the function
documentation and the name of the library containing the function's
source.  Place point over the name of the library and press the RET
key; you will be taken directly to the source.  (Be sure to install
your sources!  Without them, you are like a person who tries to drive
a car with his eyes shut!)

Repetition and regular expression searches are powerful tools that you
often use when you write code in Emacs Lisp.  This chapter illustrates
the use of regular expression searches through the construction of
word count commands using <code>while</code> loops and recursion.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Counting words</h3>

   <p>The standard Emacs distribution contains functions for counting the
number of lines and words within a region.

   </p>
<p>Certain types of writing ask you to count words.  Thus, if you write
an essay, you may be limited to 800 words; if you write a novel, you
may discipline yourself to write 1000 words a day.  It seems odd, but
for a long time, Emacs lacked a word count command.  Perhaps people used
Emacs mostly for code or types of documentation that did not require
word counts; or perhaps they restricted themselves to the operating
system word count command, <code>wc</code>.  Alternatively, people may have
followed the publishers' convention and computed a word count by
dividing the number of characters in a document by five.

   </p>
<p>There are many ways to implement a command to count words.  Here are
some examples, which you may wish to compare with the standard Emacs
command, <code>count-words-region</code>.

<h3 class="section">13.1 The <code>count-words-example</code> Function</h3>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040value_007bCOUNT_002dWORDS_007d-273"></a>
A word count command could count words in a line, paragraph, region,
or buffer.  What should the command cover?  You could design the
command to count the number of words in a complete buffer.  However,
the Emacs tradition encourages flexibility—you may want to count
words in just a section, rather than all of a buffer.  So it makes
more sense to design the command to count the number of words in a
region.  Once you have a command to count words in a region, you can,
if you wish, count words in a whole buffer by marking it with
<kbd>C-x h</kbd><!-- /@w --> (<code>mark-whole-buffer</code>).

   </p>
<p>Clearly, counting words is a repetitive act: starting from the
beginning of the region, you count the first word, then the second
word, then the third word, and so on, until you reach the end of the
region.  This means that word counting is ideally suited to recursion
or to a <code>while</code> loop.

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Designing <code>count-words-example</code>
</h4>

   <p>First, we will implement the word count command with a <code>while</code>
loop, then with recursion.  The command will, of course, be
interactive.

   </p>
<p>The template for an interactive function definition is, as always:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun <var>name-of-function</var> (<var>argument-list</var>)
       "<var>documentation</var>..."
       (<var>interactive-expression</var>...)
       <var>body</var>...)
</pre>
   <p>What we need to do is fill in the slots.

   </p>
<p>The name of the function should be self-explanatory and similar to the
existing <code>count-lines-region</code> name.  This makes the name easier
to remember.  <code>count-words-region</code> is the obvious choice.  Since
that name is now used for the standard Emacs command to count words, we
will name our implementation <code>count-words-example</code>.

   </p>
<p>The function counts words within a region.  This means that the
argument list must contain symbols that are bound to the two
positions, the beginning and end of the region.  These two positions
can be called `<samp><span class="samp">beginning</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">end</span></samp>' respectively.  The first
line of the documentation should be a single sentence, since that is
all that is printed as documentation by a command such as
<code>apropos</code>.  The interactive expression will be of the form
`<samp><span class="samp">(interactive "r")</span></samp>', since that will cause Emacs to pass the
beginning and end of the region to the function's argument list.  All
this is routine.

   </p>
<p>The body of the function needs to be written to do three tasks:
first, to set up conditions under which the <code>while</code> loop can
count words, second, to run the <code>while</code> loop, and third, to send
a message to the user.

   </p>
<p>When a user calls <code>count-words-example</code>, point may be at the
beginning or the end of the region.  However, the counting process
must start at the beginning of the region.  This means we will want
to put point there if it is not already there.  Executing
<code>(goto-char beginning)</code> ensures this.  Of course, we will want to
return point to its expected position when the function finishes its
work.  For this reason, the body must be enclosed in a
<code>save-excursion</code> expression.

   </p>
<p>The central part of the body of the function consists of a
<code>while</code> loop in which one expression jumps point forward word by
word, and another expression counts those jumps.  The true-or-false-test
of the <code>while</code> loop should test true so long as point should jump
forward, and false when point is at the end of the region.

   </p>
<p>We could use <code>(forward-word 1)</code> as the expression for moving point
forward word by word, but it is easier to see what Emacs identifies as a
“word” if we use a regular expression search.

   </p>
<p>A regular expression search that finds the pattern for which it is
searching leaves point after the last character matched.  This means
that a succession of successful word searches will move point forward
word by word.

   </p>
<p>As a practical matter, we want the regular expression search to jump
over whitespace and punctuation between words as well as over the
words themselves.  A regexp that refuses to jump over interword
whitespace would never jump more than one word!  This means that
the regexp should include the whitespace and punctuation that follows
a word, if any, as well as the word itself.  (A word may end a buffer
and not have any following whitespace or punctuation, so that part of
the regexp must be optional.)

   </p>
<p>Thus, what we want for the regexp is a pattern defining one or more
word constituent characters followed, optionally, by one or more
characters that are not word constituents.  The regular expression for
this is:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     \w+\W*
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The buffer's syntax table determines which characters are and are not
word constituents.  For more information about syntax,
see <a href="elisp.html#Syntax-Tables">Syntax Tables</a>.

   </p>
<p>The search expression looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (re-search-forward "\\w+\\W*")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(Note that paired backslashes precede the `<samp><span class="samp">w</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">W</span></samp>'.  A
single backslash has special meaning to the Emacs Lisp interpreter. 
It indicates that the following character is interpreted differently
than usual.  For example, the two characters, `<samp><span class="samp">\n</span></samp>', stand for
`<samp><span class="samp">newline</span></samp>', rather than for a backslash followed by `<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>'.  Two
backslashes in a row stand for an ordinary, unspecial backslash, so
Emacs Lisp interpreter ends of seeing a single backslash followed by a
letter.  So it discovers the letter is special.)

   </p>
<p>We need a counter to count how many words there are; this variable
must first be set to 0 and then incremented each time Emacs goes
around the <code>while</code> loop.  The incrementing expression is simply:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setq count (1+ count))
</pre>
   <p>Finally, we want to tell the user how many words there are in the
region.  The <code>message</code> function is intended for presenting this
kind of information to the user.  The message has to be phrased so
that it reads properly regardless of how many words there are in the
region: we don't want to say that “there are 1 words in the region”. 
The conflict between singular and plural is ungrammatical.  We can
solve this problem by using a conditional expression that evaluates
different messages depending on the number of words in the region. 
There are three possibilities: no words in the region, one word in the
region, and more than one word.  This means that the <code>cond</code>
special form is appropriate.

   </p>
<p>All this leads to the following function definition:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ;;; <span class="roman">First version; has bugs!</span>
     (defun count-words-example (beginning end)
       "Print number of words in the region.
     Words are defined as at least one word-constituent
     character followed by at least one character that
     is not a word-constituent.  The buffer's syntax
     table determines which characters these are."
       (interactive "r")
       (message "Counting words in region ... ")
     
     ;;; <span class="roman">1. Set up appropriate conditions.</span>
       (save-excursion

             (setq count (1+ count)))
     
     ;;; <span class="roman">3. Send a message to the user.</span>
           (cond ((zerop count)

                 ((= 1 count)

                   "The region has 1 word."))

                  (message
                   "The region has %d words." count))))))
</pre>

<h4 class="subsection">13.1.1 The Whitespace Bug in <code>count-words-example</code>
</h4>

<p>The <code>count-words-example</code> command described in the preceding
section has two bugs, or rather, one bug with two manifestations. 
First, if you mark a region containing only whitespace in the middle
of some text, the <code>count-words-example</code> command tells you that the
region contains one word!  Second, if you mark a region containing
only whitespace at the end of the buffer or the accessible portion of
a narrowed buffer, the command displays an error message that looks
like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     Search failed: "\\w+\\W*"
</pre>
   <p>If you are reading this in Info in GNU Emacs, you can test for these
bugs yourself.

   </p>
<p>First, evaluate the function in the usual manner to install it.

   </p>
<p>If you wish, you can also install this keybinding by evaluating it:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (global-set-key "\C-c=" 'count-words-example)
</pre>
   <p>To conduct the first test, set mark and point to the beginning and end
of the following line and then type <kbd>C-c =</kbd> (or <kbd>M-x
count-words-example</kbd> if you have not bound <kbd>C-c =</kbd>):

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">         one   two  three
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Emacs will tell you, correctly, that the region has three words.

   </p>
<p>Repeat the test, but place mark at the beginning of the line and place
point just <em>before</em> the word `<samp><span class="samp">one</span></samp>'.  Again type the command
<kbd>C-c =</kbd> (or <kbd>M-x count-words-example</kbd>).  Emacs should tell you
that the region has no words, since it is composed only of the
whitespace at the beginning of the line.  But instead Emacs tells you
that the region has one word!

   </p>
<p>For the third test, copy the sample line to the end of the
<samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer and then type several spaces at the end of the
line.  Place mark right after the word `<samp><span class="samp">three</span></samp>' and point at the
end of line.  (The end of the line will be the end of the buffer.) 
Type <kbd>C-c =</kbd> (or <kbd>M-x count-words-example</kbd>) as you did before. 
Again, Emacs should tell you that the region has no words, since it is
composed only of the whitespace at the end of the line.  Instead,
Emacs displays an error message saying `<samp><span class="samp">Search failed</span></samp>'.

   </p>
<p>The two bugs stem from the same problem.

   </p>
<p>Consider the first manifestation of the bug, in which the command
tells you that the whitespace at the beginning of the line contains
one word.  What happens is this: The <code>M-x count-words-example</code>
command moves point to the beginning of the region.  The <code>while</code>
tests whether the value of point is smaller than the value of
<code>end</code>, which it is.  Consequently, the regular expression search
looks for and finds the first word.  It leaves point after the word. 
<code>count</code> is set to one.  The <code>while</code> loop repeats; but this
time the value of point is larger than the value of <code>end</code>, the
loop is exited; and the function displays a message saying the number
of words in the region is one.  In brief, the regular expression
search looks for and finds the word even though it is outside
the marked region.

   </p>
<p>In the second manifestation of the bug, the region is whitespace at
the end of the buffer.  Emacs says `<samp><span class="samp">Search failed</span></samp>'.  What happens
is that the true-or-false-test in the <code>while</code> loop tests true, so
the search expression is executed.  But since there are no more words
in the buffer, the search fails.

   </p>
<p>In both manifestations of the bug, the search extends or attempts to
extend outside of the region.

   </p>
<p>The solution is to limit the search to the region—this is a fairly
simple action, but as you may have come to expect, it is not quite as
simple as you might think.

   </p>
<p>As we have seen, the <code>re-search-forward</code> function takes a search
pattern as its first argument.  But in addition to this first,
mandatory argument, it accepts three optional arguments.  The optional
second argument bounds the search.  The optional third argument, if
<code>t</code>, causes the function to return <code>nil</code> rather than signal
an error if the search fails.  The optional fourth argument is a
repeat count.  (In Emacs, you can see a function's documentation by
typing <kbd>C-h f</kbd>, the name of the function, and then &lt;RET&gt;.)

   </p>
<p>In the <code>count-words-example</code> definition, the value of the end of
the region is held by the variable <code>end</code> which is passed as an
argument to the function.  Thus, we can add <code>end</code> as an argument
to the regular expression search expression:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (re-search-forward "\\w+\\W*" end)
</pre>
   <p>However, if you make only this change to the <code>count-words-example</code>
definition and then test the new version of the definition on a
stretch of whitespace, you will receive an error message saying
`<samp><span class="samp">Search failed</span></samp>'.

   </p>
<p>What happens is this: the search is limited to the region, and fails
as you expect because there are no word-constituent characters in the
region.  Since it fails, we receive an error message.  But we do not
want to receive an error message in this case; we want to receive the
message “The region does NOT have any words.”

   </p>
<p>The solution to this problem is to provide <code>re-search-forward</code>
with a third argument of <code>t</code>, which causes the function to return
<code>nil</code> rather than signal an error if the search fails.

   </p>
<p>However, if you make this change and try it, you will see the message
“Counting words in region ... ” and <small class="dots">...</small> you will keep on seeing
that message <small class="dots">...</small>, until you type <kbd>C-g</kbd> (<code>keyboard-quit</code>).

   </p>
<p>Here is what happens: the search is limited to the region, as before,
and it fails because there are no word-constituent characters in the
region, as expected.  Consequently, the <code>re-search-forward</code>
expression returns <code>nil</code>.  It does nothing else.  In particular,
it does not move point, which it does as a side effect if it finds the
search target.  After the <code>re-search-forward</code> expression returns
<code>nil</code>, the next expression in the <code>while</code> loop is evaluated. 
This expression increments the count.  Then the loop repeats.  The
true-or-false-test tests true because the value of point is still less
than the value of end, since the <code>re-search-forward</code> expression
did not move point. <small class="dots">...</small> and the cycle repeats <small class="dots">...</small>

   </p>
<p>The <code>count-words-example</code> definition requires yet another
modification, to cause the true-or-false-test of the <code>while</code> loop
to test false if the search fails.  Put another way, there are two
conditions that must be satisfied in the true-or-false-test before the
word count variable is incremented: point must still be within the
region and the search expression must have found a word to count.

   </p>
<p>Since both the first condition and the second condition must be true
together, the two expressions, the region test and the search
expression, can be joined with an <code>and</code> special form and embedded in
the <code>while</code> loop as the true-or-false-test, like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (and (&lt; (point) end) (re-search-forward "\\w+\\W*" end t))
</pre>
   <!-- colon in printed section title causes problem in Info cross reference -->
<!-- also trouble with an overfull hbox -->
<p>The <code>re-search-forward</code> expression returns <code>t</code> if the search
succeeds and as a side effect moves point.  Consequently, as words are
found, point is moved through the region.  When the search expression
fails to find another word, or when point reaches the end of the
region, the true-or-false-test tests false, the <code>while</code> loop
exits, and the <code>count-words-example</code> function displays one or
other of its messages.

   </p>
<p>After incorporating these final changes, the <code>count-words-example</code>
works without bugs (or at least, without bugs that I have found!). 
Here is what it looks like:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ;;; <span class="roman">Final version:</span> <code>while</code>
     (defun count-words-example (beginning end)

<h3 class="section">13.2 Count Words Recursively</h3>

<p><a name="index-Count-words-recursively-274"></a><a name="index-Recursively-counting-words-275"></a><a name="index-Words_002c-counted-recursively-276"></a>
You can write the function for counting words recursively as well as
with a <code>while</code> loop.  Let's see how this is done.

   </p>
<p>First, we need to recognize that the <code>count-words-example</code>
function has three jobs: it sets up the appropriate conditions for
counting to occur; it counts the words in the region; and it sends a
message to the user telling how many words there are.

   </p>
<p>If we write a single recursive function to do everything, we will
receive a message for every recursive call.  If the region contains 13
words, we will receive thirteen messages, one right after the other. 
We don't want this!  Instead, we must write two functions to do the
job, one of which (the recursive function) will be used inside of the
other.  One function will set up the conditions and display the
message; the other will return the word count.

   </p>
<p>Let us start with the function that causes the message to be displayed. 
We can continue to call this <code>count-words-example</code>.

   </p>
<p>This is the function that the user will call.  It will be interactive. 
Indeed, it will be similar to our previous versions of this
function, except that it will call <code>recursive-count-words</code> to
determine how many words are in the region.

   </p>
<p>We can readily construct a template for this function, based on our
previous versions:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ;; <span class="roman">Recursive version; uses regular expression search</span>
     (defun count-words-example (beginning end)
       "<var>documentation</var>..."
       (<var>interactive-expression</var>...)
     
     ;;; <span class="roman">1. Set up appropriate conditions.</span>
       (<var>explanatory message</var>)
       (<var>set-up functions</var>...
     
     ;;; <span class="roman">2. Count the words.</span>
         <var>recursive call</var>
     
     ;;; <span class="roman">3. Send a message to the user.</span>
         <var>message providing word count</var>))
</pre>
   <p>The definition looks straightforward, except that somehow the count
returned by the recursive call must be passed to the message
displaying the word count.  A little thought suggests that this can be
done by making use of a <code>let</code> expression: we can bind a variable
in the varlist of a <code>let</code> expression to the number of words in
the region, as returned by the recursive call; and then the
<code>cond</code> expression, using binding, can display the value to the
user.

   </p>
<p>Often, one thinks of the binding within a <code>let</code> expression as
somehow secondary to the primary work of a function.  But in this
case, what you might consider the primary job of the function,
counting words, is done within the <code>let</code> expression.

   </p>
<p>Using <code>let</code>, the function definition looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun count-words-example (beginning end)
       "Print number of words in the region."
       (interactive "r")
     
     ;;; <span class="roman">1. Set up appropriate conditions.</span>
       (message "Counting words in region ... ")
       (save-excursion
         (goto-char beginning)
     
     ;;; <span class="roman">2. Count the words.</span>
         (let ((count (recursive-count-words end)))
     
     ;;; <span class="roman">3. Send a message to the user.</span>
           (cond ((zerop count)
                  (message
                   "The region does NOT have any words."))
                 ((= 1 count)
                  (message
                   "The region has 1 word."))
                 (t
                  (message
                   "The region has %d words." count))))))
</pre>
   <p>Next, we need to write the recursive counting function.

   </p>
<p>A recursive function has at least three parts: the do-again-test, the
next-step-expression, and the recursive call.

   </p>
<p>The do-again-test determines whether the function will or will not be
called again.  Since we are counting words in a region and can use a
function that moves point forward for every word, the do-again-test
can check whether point is still within the region.  The do-again-test
should find the value of point and determine whether point is before,
at, or after the value of the end of the region.  We can use the
<code>point</code> function to locate point.  Clearly, we must pass the
value of the end of the region to the recursive counting function as an
argument.

   </p>
<p>In addition, the do-again-test should also test whether the search finds a
word.  If it does not, the function should not call itself again.

   </p>
<p>The next-step-expression changes a value so that when the recursive
function is supposed to stop calling itself, it stops.  More
precisely, the next-step-expression changes a value so that at the
right time, the do-again-test stops the recursive function from
calling itself again.  In this case, the next-step-expression can be
the expression that moves point forward, word by word.

   </p>
<p>The third part of a recursive function is the recursive call.

   </p>
<p>Somewhere, we also need a part that does the work of the
function, a part that does the counting.  A vital part!

   </p>
<p>But already, we have an outline of the recursive counting function:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun recursive-count-words (region-end)
       "<var>documentation</var>..."
        <var>do-again-test</var>
        <var>next-step-expression</var>
        <var>recursive call</var>)
</pre>
   <p>Now we need to fill in the slots.  Let's start with the simplest cases
first:  if point is at or beyond the end of the region, there cannot
be any words in the region, so the function should return zero. 
Likewise, if the search fails, there are no words to count, so the
function should return zero.

   </p>
<p>On the other hand, if point is within the region and the search
succeeds, the function should call itself again.

   </p>
<p>Thus, the do-again-test should look like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (and (&lt; (point) region-end)
          (re-search-forward "\\w+\\W*" region-end t))
</pre>
   <p>Note that the search expression is part of the do-again-test—the
function returns <code>t</code> if its search succeeds and <code>nil</code> if it
fails.  (See <a href="#Whitespace-Bug">The Whitespace Bug in <code>count-words-example</code></a>, for an explanation of how
<code>re-search-forward</code> works.)

   </p>
<p>The do-again-test is the true-or-false test of an <code>if</code> clause. 
Clearly, if the do-again-test succeeds, the then-part of the <code>if</code>
clause should call the function again; but if it fails, the else-part
should return zero since either point is outside the region or the
search failed because there were no words to find.

   </p>
<p>But before considering the recursive call, we need to consider the
next-step-expression.  What is it?  Interestingly, it is the search
part of the do-again-test.

   </p>
<p>In addition to returning <code>t</code> or <code>nil</code> for the
do-again-test, <code>re-search-forward</code> moves point forward as a side
effect of a successful search.  This is the action that changes the
value of point so that the recursive function stops calling itself
when point completes its movement through the region.  Consequently,
the <code>re-search-forward</code> expression is the next-step-expression.

   </p>
<p>In outline, then, the body of the <code>recursive-count-words</code>
function looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (if <var>do-again-test-and-next-step-combined</var>
         ;; <span class="roman">then</span>
         <var>recursive-call-returning-count</var>
       ;; <span class="roman">else</span>
       <var>return-zero</var>)
</pre>
   <p>How to incorporate the mechanism that counts?

   </p>
<p>If you are not used to writing recursive functions, a question like
this can be troublesome.  But it can and should be approached
systematically.

   </p>
<p>We know that the counting mechanism should be associated in some way
with the recursive call.  Indeed, since the next-step-expression moves
point forward by one word, and since a recursive call is made for
each word, the counting mechanism must be an expression that adds one
to the value returned by a call to <code>recursive-count-words</code>.

   </p>
<p>Consider several cases:

     </p>
<ul>
<li>If there are two words in the region, the function should return
a value resulting from adding one to the value returned when it counts
the first word, plus the number returned when it counts the remaining
words in the region, which in this case is one.

     </li>
<li>If there is one word in the region, the function should return
a value resulting from adding one to the value returned when it counts
that word, plus the number returned when it counts the remaining
words in the region, which in this case is zero.

     </li>
<li>If there are no words in the region, the function should return zero. 
</li>
</ul>

   <p>From the sketch we can see that the else-part of the <code>if</code> returns
zero for the case of no words.  This means that the then-part of the
<code>if</code> must return a value resulting from adding one to the value
returned from a count of the remaining words.

   </p>
<p>The expression will look like this, where <code>1+</code> is a function that
adds one to its argument.

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (1+ (recursive-count-words region-end))
</pre>
   <p>The whole <code>recursive-count-words</code> function will then look like
this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun recursive-count-words (region-end)
       "<var>documentation</var>..."
     
     ;;; <span class="roman">1. do-again-test</span>
       (if (and (&lt; (point) region-end)
                (re-search-forward "\\w+\\W*" region-end t))
     
     ;;; <span class="roman">2. then-part: the recursive call</span>
           (1+ (recursive-count-words region-end))
     
     ;;; <span class="roman">3. else-part</span>
         0))
</pre>
   <p>Let's examine how this works:

   </p>
<p>If there are no words in the region, the else part of the <code>if</code>
expression is evaluated and consequently the function returns zero.

   </p>
<p>If there is one word in the region, the value of point is less than
the value of <code>region-end</code> and the search succeeds.  In this case,
the true-or-false-test of the <code>if</code> expression tests true, and the
then-part of the <code>if</code> expression is evaluated.  The counting
expression is evaluated.  This expression returns a value (which will
be the value returned by the whole function) that is the sum of one
added to the value returned by a recursive call.

   </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the next-step-expression has caused point to jump over the
first (and in this case only) word in the region.  This means that
when <code>(recursive-count-words region-end)</code> is evaluated a second
time, as a result of the recursive call, the value of point will be
equal to or greater than the value of region end.  So this time,
<code>recursive-count-words</code> will return zero.  The zero will be added
to one, and the original evaluation of <code>recursive-count-words</code>
will return one plus zero, which is one, which is the correct amount.

   </p>
<p>Clearly, if there are two words in the region, the first call to
<code>recursive-count-words</code> returns one added to the value returned
by calling <code>recursive-count-words</code> on a region containing the
remaining word—that is, it adds one to one, producing two, which is
the correct amount.

   </p>
<p>Similarly, if there are three words in the region, the first call to
<code>recursive-count-words</code> returns one added to the value returned
by calling <code>recursive-count-words</code> on a region containing the
remaining two words—and so on and so on.

Our next project is to count the number of words in a function
definition.  Clearly, this can be done using some variant of
<code>count-words-example</code>.  See <a href="#Counting-Words">Counting via Repetition and Regexps</a>.  If we are just going to count the words in
one definition, it is easy enough to mark the definition with the
<kbd>C-M-h</kbd> (<code>mark-defun</code>) command, and then call
<code>count-words-example</code>.

   </p>
<p>However, I am more ambitious: I want to count the words and symbols in
every definition in the Emacs sources and then print a graph that
shows how many functions there are of each length: how many contain 40
to 49 words or symbols, how many contain 50 to 59 words or symbols,
and so on.  I have often been curious how long a typical function is,
and this will tell.

   <p>Described in one phrase, the histogram project is daunting; but
divided into numerous small steps, each of which we can take one at a
time, the project becomes less fearsome.  Let us consider what the
steps must be:

     </p>
<ul>
<li>First, write a function to count the words in one definition.  This
includes the problem of handling symbols as well as words.

     </li>
<li>Second, write a function to list the number of words in each function
in a file.  This function can use the <code>count-words-in-defun</code>
function.

     </li>
<li>Third, write a function to list the number of words in each function
in each of several files.  This entails automatically finding the
various files, switching to them, and counting the words in the
definitions within them.

     </li>
<li>Fourth, write a function to convert the list of numbers that we
created in step three to a form that will be suitable for printing as
a graph.

     </li>
<li>Fifth, write a function to print the results as a graph.

<h3 class="section">14.1 What to Count?</h3>

<p><a name="index-Words-and-symbols-in-defun-280"></a>
When we first start thinking about how to count the words in a
function definition, the first question is (or ought to be) what are
we going to count?  When we speak of “words” with respect to a Lisp
function definition, we are actually speaking, in large part, of
symbols.  For example, the following <code>multiply-by-seven</code>
function contains the five symbols <code>defun</code>,
<code>multiply-by-seven</code>, <code>number</code>, <code>*</code>, and <code>7</code>.  In
addition, in the documentation string, it contains the four words
`<samp><span class="samp">Multiply</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">NUMBER</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">by</span></samp>', and `<samp><span class="samp">seven</span></samp>'.  The
symbol `<samp><span class="samp">number</span></samp>' is repeated, so the definition contains a total
of ten words and symbols.

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun multiply-by-seven (number)
       "Multiply NUMBER by seven."
       (* 7 number))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">However, if we mark the <code>multiply-by-seven</code> definition with
<kbd>C-M-h</kbd> (<code>mark-defun</code>), and then call
<code>count-words-example</code> on it, we will find that
<code>count-words-example</code> claims the definition has eleven words, not
ten!  Something is wrong!

   </p>
<p>The problem is twofold: <code>count-words-example</code> does not count the
`<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' as a word, and it counts the single symbol,
<code>multiply-by-seven</code>, as containing three words.  The hyphens are
treated as if they were interword spaces rather than intraword
connectors: `<samp><span class="samp">multiply-by-seven</span></samp>' is counted as if it were written
`<samp><span class="samp">multiply by seven</span></samp>'.

   </p>
<p>The cause of this confusion is the regular expression search within
the <code>count-words-example</code> definition that moves point forward word
by word.  In the canonical version of <code>count-words-example</code>, the
regexp is:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     "\\w+\\W*"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This regular expression is a pattern defining one or more word
constituent characters possibly followed by one or more characters
that are not word constituents.  What is meant by “word constituent
characters” brings us to the issue of syntax, which is worth a section
of its own.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Syntax"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">14.2 What Constitutes a Word or Symbol?</h3>

<p><a name="index-Syntax-categories-and-tables-281"></a>
Emacs treats different characters as belonging to different
<dfn>syntax categories</dfn>.  For example, the regular expression,
`<samp><span class="samp">\\w+</span></samp>', is a pattern specifying one or more <em>word
constituent</em> characters.  Word constituent characters are members of
one syntax category.  Other syntax categories include the class of
punctuation characters, such as the period and the comma, and the
class of whitespace characters, such as the blank space and the tab
character.  (For more information, see <a href="elisp.html#Syntax-Tables">Syntax Tables</a>.)

   </p>
<p>Syntax tables specify which characters belong to which categories. 
Usually, a hyphen is not specified as a word constituent character. 
Instead, it is specified as being in the class of characters that are
part of symbol names but not words.  This means that the
<code>count-words-example</code> function treats it in the same way it treats
an interword white space, which is why <code>count-words-example</code>
counts `<samp><span class="samp">multiply-by-seven</span></samp>' as three words.

   </p>
<p>There are two ways to cause Emacs to count `<samp><span class="samp">multiply-by-seven</span></samp>' as
one symbol: modify the syntax table or modify the regular expression.

   </p>
<p>We could redefine a hyphen as a word constituent character by
modifying the syntax table that Emacs keeps for each mode.  This
action would serve our purpose, except that a hyphen is merely the
most common character within symbols that is not typically a word
constituent character; there are others, too.

   </p>
<p>Alternatively, we can redefine the regexp used in the
<code>count-words-example</code> definition so as to include symbols.  This
procedure has the merit of clarity, but the task is a little tricky.

   </p>
<p>The first part is simple enough: the pattern must match at least one
character that is a word or symbol constituent.  Thus:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     "\\(\\w\\|\\s_\\)+"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The `<samp><span class="samp">\\(</span></samp>' is the first part of the grouping construct that
includes the `<samp><span class="samp">\\w</span></samp>' and the `<samp><span class="samp">\\s_</span></samp>' as alternatives, separated
by the `<samp><span class="samp">\\|</span></samp>'.  The `<samp><span class="samp">\\w</span></samp>' matches any word-constituent
character and the `<samp><span class="samp">\\s_</span></samp>' matches any character that is part of a
symbol name but not a word-constituent character.  The `<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>'
following the group indicates that the word or symbol constituent
characters must be matched at least once.

   </p>
<p>However, the second part of the regexp is more difficult to design. 
What we want is to follow the first part with optionally one or more
characters that are not constituents of a word or symbol.  At first,
I thought I could define this with the following:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     "\\(\\W\\|\\S_\\)*"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The upper case `<samp><span class="samp">W</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">S</span></samp>' match characters that are
<em>not</em> word or symbol constituents.  Unfortunately, this
expression matches any character that is either not a word constituent
or not a symbol constituent.  This matches any character!

   </p>
<p>I then noticed that every word or symbol in my test region was
followed by white space (blank space, tab, or newline).  So I tried
placing a pattern to match one or more blank spaces after the pattern
for one or more word or symbol constituents.  This failed, too.  Words
and symbols are often separated by whitespace, but in actual code
parentheses may follow symbols and punctuation may follow words.  So
finally, I designed a pattern in which the word or symbol constituents
are followed optionally by characters that are not white space and
then followed optionally by white space.

   </p>
<p>Here is the full regular expression:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     "\\(\\w\\|\\s_\\)+[^ \t\n]*[ \t\n]*"
</pre>
   <div class="node">
<a name="count-words-in-defun"></a><a name="count_002dwords_002din_002ddefun"></a>
</div>

<h3 class="section">14.3 The <code>count-words-in-defun</code> Function</h3>

<p><a name="index-Counting-words-in-a-_0040code_007bdefun_007d-282"></a>
We have seen that there are several ways to write a
<code>count-words-region</code> function.  To write a
<code>count-words-in-defun</code>, we need merely adapt one of these
versions.

   </p>
<p>The version that uses a <code>while</code> loop is easy to understand, so I
am going to adapt that.  Because <code>count-words-in-defun</code> will be
part of a more complex program, it need not be interactive and it need
not display a message but just return the count.  These considerations
simplify the definition a little.

   </p>
<p>On the other hand, <code>count-words-in-defun</code> will be used within a
buffer that contains function definitions.  Consequently, it is
reasonable to ask that the function determine whether it is called
when point is within a function definition, and if it is, to return
the count for that definition.  This adds complexity to the
definition, but saves us from needing to pass arguments to the
function.

   </p>
<p>These considerations lead us to prepare the following template:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun count-words-in-defun ()
       "<var>documentation</var>..."
       (<var>set up</var>...
          (<var>while loop</var>...)
        <var>return count</var>)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">As usual, our job is to fill in the slots.

   </p>
<p>First, the set up.

   </p>
<p>We are presuming that this function will be called within a buffer
containing function definitions.  Point will either be within a
function definition or not.  For <code>count-words-in-defun</code> to work,
point must move to the beginning of the definition, a counter must
start at zero, and the counting loop must stop when point reaches the
end of the definition.

   </p>
<p>The <code>beginning-of-defun</code> function searches backwards for an
opening delimiter such as a `<samp><span class="samp">(</span></samp>' at the beginning of a line, and
moves point to that position, or else to the limit of the search.  In
practice, this means that <code>beginning-of-defun</code> moves point to the
beginning of an enclosing or preceding function definition, or else to
the beginning of the buffer.  We can use <code>beginning-of-defun</code> to
place point where we wish to start.

   </p>
<p>The <code>while</code> loop requires a counter to keep track of the words or
symbols being counted.  A <code>let</code> expression can be used to create
a local variable for this purpose, and bind it to an initial value of zero.

   </p>
<p>The <code>end-of-defun</code> function works like <code>beginning-of-defun</code>
except that it moves point to the end of the definition. 
<code>end-of-defun</code> can be used as part of an expression that
determines the position of the end of the definition.

   </p>
<p>The set up for <code>count-words-in-defun</code> takes shape rapidly: first
we move point to the beginning of the definition, then we create a
local variable to hold the count, and finally, we record the position
of the end of the definition so the <code>while</code> loop will know when to stop
looping.

   </p>
<p>The code looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (beginning-of-defun)
     (let ((count 0)
           (end (save-excursion (end-of-defun) (point))))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The code is simple.  The only slight complication is likely to concern
<code>end</code>: it is bound to the position of the end of the definition
by a <code>save-excursion</code> expression that returns the value of point
after <code>end-of-defun</code> temporarily moves it to the end of the
definition.

   </p>
<p>The second part of the <code>count-words-in-defun</code>, after the set up,
is the <code>while</code> loop.

   </p>
<p>The loop must contain an expression that jumps point forward word by
word and symbol by symbol, and another expression that counts the
jumps.  The true-or-false-test for the <code>while</code> loop should test
true so long as point should jump forward, and false when point is at
the end of the definition.  We have already redefined the regular
expression for this, so the loop is straightforward:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (while (and (&lt; (point) end)
                 (re-search-forward
                  "\\(\\w\\|\\s_\\)+[^ \t\n]*[ \t\n]*" end t))
       (setq count (1+ count)))
</pre>
   <p>The third part of the function definition returns the count of words
and symbols.  This part is the last expression within the body of the
<code>let</code> expression, and can be, very simply, the local variable
<code>count</code>, which when evaluated returns the count.

   </p>
<p>Put together, the <code>count-words-in-defun</code> definition looks like this:

   </p>
<p><a name="index-count_002dwords_002din_002ddefun-283"></a>

   <p>How to test this?  The function is not interactive, but it is easy to
put a wrapper around the function to make it interactive; we can use
almost the same code as for the recursive version of

          ((= 1 count)
           (message
            "The definition has 1 word or symbol."))
          (t

   <p class="noindent">Let's re-use <kbd>C-c =</kbd> as a convenient keybinding:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (global-set-key "\C-c=" 'count-words-defun)
</pre>
   <p>Now we can try out <code>count-words-defun</code>: install both
<code>count-words-in-defun</code> and <code>count-words-defun</code>, and set the
keybinding, and then place the cursor within the following definition:

   </p>
<p>The next problem is to count the numbers of words and symbols in
several definitions within a single file.

<h3 class="section">14.4 Count Several <code>defuns</code> Within a File</h3>

<p>A file such as <samp><span class="file">simple.el</span></samp> may have a hundred or more function
definitions within it.  Our long term goal is to collect statistics on
many files, but as a first step, our immediate goal is to collect
statistics on one file.

   </p>
<p>The information will be a series of numbers, each number being the
length of a function definition.  We can store the numbers in a list.

   </p>
<p>We know that we will want to incorporate the information regarding one
file with information about many other files; this means that the
function for counting definition lengths within one file need only
return the list of lengths.  It need not and should not display any
messages.

   </p>
<p>The word count commands contain one expression to jump point forward
word by word and another expression to count the jumps.  The function
to return the lengths of definitions can be designed to work the same
way, with one expression to jump point forward definition by
definition and another expression to construct the lengths' list.

   </p>
<p>This statement of the problem makes it elementary to write the
function definition.  Clearly, we will start the count at the
beginning of the file, so the first command will be <code>(goto-char
(point-min))</code>.  Next, we start the <code>while</code> loop; and the
true-or-false test of the loop can be a regular expression search for
the next function definition—so long as the search succeeds, point
is moved forward and then the body of the loop is evaluated.  The body
needs an expression that constructs the lengths' list.  <code>cons</code>,
the list construction command, can be used to create the list.  That
is almost all there is to it.

   </p>
<p>Here is what this fragment of code looks like:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (goto-char (point-min))
     (while (re-search-forward "^(defun" nil t)
       (setq lengths-list
             (cons (count-words-in-defun) lengths-list)))
</pre>
   <p>What we have left out is the mechanism for finding the file that
contains the function definitions.

   </p>
<p>In previous examples, we either used this, the Info file, or we
switched back and forth to some other buffer, such as the
<samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer.

   </p>
<p>Finding a file is a new process that we have not yet discussed.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Find-a-File"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">14.5 Find a File</h3>

<p><a name="index-Find-a-File-284"></a>
To find a file in Emacs, you use the <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> (<code>find-file</code>)
command.  This command is almost, but not quite right for the lengths
problem.

   </p>
<p>Let's look at the source for <code>find-file</code>:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun find-file (filename)
       "Edit file FILENAME.
     Switch to a buffer visiting file FILENAME,
     creating one if none already exists."
       (interactive "FFind file: ")
       (switch-to-buffer (find-file-noselect filename)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(The most recent version of the <code>find-file</code> function definition
permits you to specify optional wildcards to visit multiple files; that
makes the definition more complex and we will not discuss it here,
since it is not relevant.  You can see its source using either
<kbd>M-.</kbd> (<code>find-tag</code>) or <kbd>C-h f</kbd> (<code>describe-function</code>).)

   </p>
<p>The definition I am showing possesses short but complete documentation
and an interactive specification that prompts you for a file name when
you use the command interactively.  The body of the definition
contains two functions, <code>find-file-noselect</code> and
<code>switch-to-buffer</code>.

   </p>
<p>According to its documentation as shown by <kbd>C-h f</kbd> (the
<code>describe-function</code> command), the <code>find-file-noselect</code>
function reads the named file into a buffer and returns the buffer. 
(Its most recent version includes an optional <var>wildcards</var> argument,
too, as well as another to read a file literally and an other you
suppress warning messages.  These optional arguments are irrelevant.)

   </p>
<p>However, the <code>find-file-noselect</code> function does not select the
buffer in which it puts the file.  Emacs does not switch its attention
(or yours if you are using <code>find-file-noselect</code>) to the selected
buffer.  That is what <code>switch-to-buffer</code> does: it switches the
buffer to which Emacs attention is directed; and it switches the
buffer displayed in the window to the new buffer.  We have discussed
buffer switching elsewhere.  (See <a href="#Switching-Buffers">Switching Buffers</a>.)

   </p>
<p>In this histogram project, we do not need to display each file on the
screen as the program determines the length of each definition within
it.  Instead of employing <code>switch-to-buffer</code>, we can work with
<code>set-buffer</code>, which redirects the attention of the computer
program to a different buffer but does not redisplay it on the screen. 
So instead of calling on <code>find-file</code> to do the job, we must write
our own expression.

   </p>
<p>The task is easy: use <code>find-file-noselect</code> and <code>set-buffer</code>.

<div class="node">
<a name="lengths-list-file"></a><a name="lengths_002dlist_002dfile"></a>
</div>

<h3 class="section">14.6 <code>lengths-list-file</code> in Detail</h3>

<p>The core of the <code>lengths-list-file</code> function is a <code>while</code>
loop containing a function to move point forward defun by defun, and
a function to count the number of words and symbols in each defun. 
This core must be surrounded by functions that do various other tasks,
including finding the file, and ensuring that point starts out at the
beginning of the file.  The function definition looks like this:
<a name="index-lengths_002dlist_002dfile-285"></a>
</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun lengths-list-file (filename)
       "Return list of definitions' lengths within FILE.
     The returned list is a list of numbers.
     Each number is the number of words or
     symbols in one function definition."
       (message "Working on `%s' ... " filename)
       (save-excursion
         (let ((buffer (find-file-noselect filename))
               (lengths-list))
           (set-buffer buffer)
           (setq buffer-read-only t)
           (widen)
           (goto-char (point-min))
           (while (re-search-forward "^(defun" nil t)
             (setq lengths-list
                   (cons (count-words-in-defun) lengths-list)))
           (kill-buffer buffer)
           lengths-list)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The function is passed one argument, the name of the file on which it
will work.  It has four lines of documentation, but no interactive
specification.  Since people worry that a computer is broken if they
don't see anything going on, the first line of the body is a
message.

   </p>
<p>The next line contains a <code>save-excursion</code> that returns Emacs's
attention to the current buffer when the function completes.  This is
useful in case you embed this function in another function that
presumes point is restored to the original buffer.

   </p>
<p>In the varlist of the <code>let</code> expression, Emacs finds the file and
binds the local variable <code>buffer</code> to the buffer containing the
file.  At the same time, Emacs creates <code>lengths-list</code> as a local
variable.

   </p>
<p>Next, Emacs switches its attention to the buffer.

   </p>
<p>In the following line, Emacs makes the buffer read-only.  Ideally,
this line is not necessary.  None of the functions for counting words
and symbols in a function definition should change the buffer. 
Besides, the buffer is not going to be saved, even if it were changed. 
This line is entirely the consequence of great, perhaps excessive,
caution.  The reason for the caution is that this function and those
it calls work on the sources for Emacs and it is inconvenient if they
are inadvertently modified.  It goes without saying that I did not
realize a need for this line until an experiment went awry and started
to modify my Emacs source files <small class="dots">...</small>

   </p>
<p>Next comes a call to widen the buffer if it is narrowed.  This
function is usually not needed—Emacs creates a fresh buffer if none
already exists; but if a buffer visiting the file already exists Emacs
returns that one.  In this case, the buffer may be narrowed and must
be widened.  If we wanted to be fully user-friendly, we would
arrange to save the restriction and the location of point, but we
won't.

   </p>
<p>The <code>(goto-char (point-min))</code> expression moves point to the
beginning of the buffer.

   </p>
<p>Then comes a <code>while</code> loop in which the work of the function is
carried out.  In the loop, Emacs determines the length of each
definition and constructs a lengths' list containing the information.

   </p>
<p>Emacs kills the buffer after working through it.  This is to save
space inside of Emacs.  My version of GNU Emacs 19 contained over 300
source files of interest; GNU Emacs 22 contains over a thousand source
files.  Another function will apply <code>lengths-list-file</code> to each
of the files.

   </p>
<p>Finally, the last expression within the <code>let</code> expression is the
<code>lengths-list</code> variable; its value is returned as the value of
the whole function.

   </p>
<p>You can try this function by installing it in the usual fashion.  Then
place your cursor after the following expression and type <kbd>C-x
C-e</kbd> (<code>eval-last-sexp</code>).

<!-- !!! 22.1.1 lisp sources location here -->
</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (lengths-list-file
      "/usr/local/share/emacs/22.1/lisp/emacs-lisp/debug.el")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You may need to change the pathname of the file; the one here is for
GNU Emacs version 22.1.  To change the expression, copy it to
the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer and edit it.

</p>
<p class="noindent">Also, to see the full length of the list, rather than a truncated
version, you may have to evaluate the following:
<!-- We do not want to insert, so do not mention the zero prefix argument. -->

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (custom-set-variables '(eval-expression-print-length nil))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(See <a href="#defcustom">Specifying Variables using <code>defcustom</code></a>. 
Then evaluate the <code>lengths-list-file</code> expression.)

   </p>
<p>The lengths' list for <samp><span class="file">debug.el</span></samp> takes less than a second to
produce and looks like this in GNU Emacs 22:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (83 113 105 144 289 22 30 97 48 89 25 52 52 88 28 29 77 49 43 290 232 587)
</pre>
   <p>(Using my old machine, the version 19 lengths' list for <samp><span class="file">debug.el</span></samp>
took seven seconds to produce and looked like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (75 41 80 62 20 45 44 68 45 12 34 235)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The newer version of <samp><span class="file">debug.el</span></samp> contains more defuns than the
earlier one; and my new machine is much faster than the old one.)

   </p>
<p>Note that the length of the last definition in the file is first in
the list.

<div class="node"><a name="Several-files"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">14.7 Count Words in <code>defuns</code> in Different Files</h3>

<p>In the previous section, we created a function that returns a list of
the lengths of each definition in a file.  Now, we want to define a
function to return a master list of the lengths of the definitions in
a list of files.

   </p>
<p>Working on each of a list of files is a repetitious act, so we can use
either a <code>while</code> loop or recursion.

</p>

</div>

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Determine the lengths of <code>defuns</code>
</h4>

   <p>The design using a <code>while</code> loop is routine.  The argument passed
to the function is a list of files.  As we saw earlier (see <a href="#Loop-Example">Loop Example</a>), you can write a <code>while</code> loop so that the body of the
loop is evaluated if such a list contains elements, but to exit the
loop if the list is empty.  For this design to work, the body of the
loop must contain an expression that shortens the list each time the
body is evaluated, so that eventually the list is empty.  The usual
technique is to set the value of the list to the value of the <span class="sc">cdr</span>
of the list each time the body is evaluated.

   </p>
<p>The template looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (while <var>test-whether-list-is-empty</var>
       <var>body</var>...
       <var>set-list-to-cdr-of-list</var>)
</pre>
   <p>Also, we remember that a <code>while</code> loop returns <code>nil</code> (the
result of evaluating the true-or-false-test), not the result of any
evaluation within its body.  (The evaluations within the body of the
loop are done for their side effects.)  However, the expression that
sets the lengths' list is part of the body—and that is the value
that we want returned by the function as a whole.  To do this, we
enclose the <code>while</code> loop within a <code>let</code> expression, and
arrange that the last element of the <code>let</code> expression contains
the value of the lengths' list.  (See <a href="#Incrementing-Example">Loop Example with an Incrementing Counter</a>.)

   </p>
<p><a name="index-lengths_002dlist_002dmany_002dfiles-286"></a>These considerations lead us directly to the function itself:

   <p><code>expand-file-name</code> is a built-in function that converts a file
name to the absolute, long, path name form.  The function employs the
name of the directory in which the function is called.

<!-- !!! 22.1.1 lisp sources location here -->
</p>
<p>Thus, if <code>expand-file-name</code> is called on <code>debug.el</code> when

<p>Besides a <code>while</code> loop, you can work on each of a list of files

   </p>
<p>The recursive function has the usual parts: the do-again-test, the
next-step-expression, and the recursive call.  The do-again-test
determines whether the function should call itself again, which it
will do if the <code>list-of-files</code> contains any remaining elements;
the next-step-expression resets the <code>list-of-files</code> to the
<span class="sc">cdr</span> of itself, so eventually the list will be empty; and the
recursive call calls itself on the shorter list.  The complete
function is shorter than this description!

many contain between 20 and 29 words and symbols, and so on.

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">The Data for Display in Detail</h4>

   <p>Based on what we have done before, we can readily foresee that it
should not be too hard to write a function that <span class="sc">cdr</span>s down the
lengths' list, looks at each element, determines which length range it
is in, and increments a counter for that range.

   </p>
<p>However, before beginning to write such a function, we should consider
the advantages of sorting the lengths' list first, so the numbers are
ordered from smallest to largest.  First, sorting will make it easier
to count the numbers in each range, since two adjacent numbers will
either be in the same length range or in adjacent ranges.  Second, by
inspecting a sorted list, we can discover the highest and lowest
number, and thereby determine the largest and smallest length range
that we will need.

<h4 class="subsection">14.9.1 Sorting Lists</h4>

<p><a name="index-sort-288"></a>
Emacs contains a function to sort lists, called (as you might guess)
<code>sort</code>.  The <code>sort</code> function takes two arguments, the list
to be sorted, and a predicate that determines whether the first of
two list elements is less than the second.

   </p>
<p>As we saw earlier (see <a href="#Wrong-Type-of-Argument">Using the Wrong Type Object as an Argument</a>), a predicate is a function that
determines whether some property is true or false.  The <code>sort</code>
function will reorder a list according to whatever property the
predicate uses; this means that <code>sort</code> can be used to sort
non-numeric lists by non-numeric criteria—it can, for example,
alphabetize a list.

   </p>
<p>The <code>&lt;</code> function is used when sorting a numeric list.  For example,

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (sort '(4 8 21 17 33 7 21 7) '&lt;)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">produces this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (4 7 7 8 17 21 21 33)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(Note that in this example, both the arguments are quoted so that the
symbols are not evaluated before being passed to <code>sort</code> as
arguments.)

   </p>
<p>Sorting the list returned by the
<code>recursive-lengths-list-many-files</code> function is straightforward;
it uses the <code>&lt;</code> function:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (sort
      (recursive-lengths-list-many-files
       '("./lisp/macros.el"
         "./lisp/mailalias.el"
         "./lisp/makesum.el"))
      '&lt;)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which produces:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (29 32 38 85 90 95 178 180 181 218 263 283 321 324 480)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(Note that in this example, the first argument to <code>sort</code> is not
quoted, since the expression must be evaluated so as to produce the
list that is passed to <code>sort</code>.)

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Files-List"></a></div>

<h4 class="subsection">14.9.2 Making a List of Files</h4>

<p>The <code>recursive-lengths-list-many-files</code> function requires a list
of files as its argument.  For our test examples, we constructed such
a list by hand; but the Emacs Lisp source directory is too large for
us to do for that.  Instead, we will write a function to do the job
for us.  In this function, we will use both a <code>while</code> loop and a
recursive call.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-directory_002dfiles-289"></a>We did not have to write a function like this for older versions of
GNU Emacs, since they placed all the `<samp><span class="samp">.el</span></samp>' files in one
directory.  Instead, we were able to use the <code>directory-files</code>
function, which lists the names of files that match a specified
pattern within a single directory.

   </p>
<p>However, recent versions of Emacs place Emacs Lisp files in
sub-directories of the top level <samp><span class="file">lisp</span></samp> directory.  This
re-arrangement eases navigation.  For example, all the mail related
files are in a <samp><span class="file">lisp</span></samp> sub-directory called <samp><span class="file">mail</span></samp>.  But at
the same time, this arrangement forces us to create a file listing
function that descends into the sub-directories.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-files_002din_002dbelow_002ddirectory-290"></a>We can create this function, called <code>files-in-below-directory</code>,
using familiar functions such as <code>car</code>, <code>nthcdr</code>, and
<code>substring</code> in conjunction with an existing function called
<code>directory-files-and-attributes</code>.  This latter function not only
lists all the filenames in a directory, including the names
of sub-directories, but also their attributes.

   </p>
<p>To restate our goal: to create a function that will enable us
to feed filenames to <code>recursive-lengths-list-many-files</code>
as a list that looks like this (but with more elements):

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ("./lisp/macros.el"
      "./lisp/mail/rmail.el"
      "./lisp/makesum.el")
</pre>
   <p>The <code>directory-files-and-attributes</code> function returns a list of
lists.  Each of the lists within the main list consists of 13
elements.  The first element is a string that contains the name of the
file—which, in GNU/Linux, may be a <dfn>directory file</dfn>, that is to
say, a file with the special attributes of a directory.  The second
element of the list is <code>t</code> for a directory, a string
for symbolic link (the string is the name linked to), or <code>nil</code>.

   </p>
<p>For example, the first `<samp><span class="samp">.el</span></samp>' file in the <samp><span class="file">lisp/</span></samp> directory
is <samp><span class="file">abbrev.el</span></samp>.  Its name is
<samp><span class="file">/usr/local/share/emacs/22.1.1/lisp/abbrev.el</span></samp> and it is not a
directory or a symbolic link.

   </p>
<p>This is how <code>directory-files-and-attributes</code> lists that file and
its attributes:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ("abbrev.el"
     nil
     1
     1000
     100
     (20615 27034 579989 697000)
     (17905 55681 0 0)
     (20615 26327 734791 805000)
     13188
     "-rw-r--r--"
     t
     2971624
     773)
</pre>
   <p>On the other hand, <samp><span class="file">mail/</span></samp> is a directory within the <samp><span class="file">lisp/</span></samp>
directory.  The beginning of its listing looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ("mail"
     t
     ...
     )
</pre>
   <p>(To learn about the different attributes, look at the documentation of
<code>file-attributes</code>.  Bear in mind that the <code>file-attributes</code>
function does not list the filename, so its first element is
<code>directory-files-and-attributes</code>'s second element.)

   </p>
<p>We will want our new function, <code>files-in-below-directory</code>, to
list the `<samp><span class="samp">.el</span></samp>' files in the directory it is told to check, and in
any directories below that directory.

   </p>
<p>This gives us a hint on how to construct
<code>files-in-below-directory</code>:  within a directory, the function
should add `<samp><span class="samp">.el</span></samp>' filenames to a list; and if, within a directory,
the function comes upon a sub-directory, it should go into that
sub-directory and repeat its actions.

   </p>
<p>However, we should note that every directory contains a name that
refers to itself, called <samp><span class="file">.</span></samp> (“dot”), and a name that refers to
its parent directory, called <samp><span class="file">..</span></samp> (“dot dot”).  (In
<samp><span class="file">/</span></samp>, the root directory, <samp><span class="file">..</span></samp> refers to itself, since
<samp><span class="file">/</span></samp> has no parent.)  Clearly, we do not want our
<code>files-in-below-directory</code> function to enter those directories,
since they always lead us, directly or indirectly, to the current
directory.

   </p>
<p>Consequently, our <code>files-in-below-directory</code> function must do
several tasks:

     </p>
<ul>
<li>Check to see whether it is looking at a filename that ends in
`<samp><span class="samp">.el</span></samp>'; and if so, add its name to a list.

     </li>
<li>Check to see whether it is looking at a filename that is the name of a
directory; and if so,

          <ul>
<li>Check to see whether it is looking at <samp><span class="file">.</span></samp>  or <samp><span class="file">..</span></samp>; and if
so skip it.

          </li>
<li>Or else, go into that directory and repeat the process. 
</li>
</ul>
     </li>
</ul>

   <p>Let's write a function definition to do these tasks.  We will use a
<code>while</code> loop to move from one filename to another within a
directory, checking what needs to be done; and we will use a recursive
call to repeat the actions on each sub-directory.  The recursive
pattern is Accumulate
(see <a href="#Accumulate">Accumulate</a>),
using <code>append</code> as the combiner.

<!-- /usr/local/share/emacs/22.1.1/lisp/ -->
</p>
<p>Here is the function:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun files-in-below-directory (directory)
       "List the .el files in DIRECTORY and in its sub-directories."
       ;; Although the function will be used non-interactively,
       ;; it will be easier to test if we make it interactive.
       ;; The directory will have a name such as
       ;;  "/usr/local/share/emacs/22.1.1/lisp/"
       (interactive "DDirectory name: ")
       (let (el-files-list
             (current-directory-list
              (directory-files-and-attributes directory t)))
         ;; while we are in the current directory
         (while current-directory-list
           (cond
            ;; check to see whether filename ends in '.el'
            ;; and if so, add its name to a list.
            ((equal ".el" (substring (car (car current-directory-list)) -3))

                 ;; then do nothing since filename is that of
                 ;;   current directory or parent, "." or ".."
                 ()
               ;; else descend into the directory and repeat the process
               (setq el-files-list
                     (append

                      el-files-list)))))
           ;; move to the next filename in the list; this also
           ;; shortens the list so the while loop eventually comes to an end
           (setq current-directory-list (cdr current-directory-list)))
         ;; return the filenames
         el-files-list))
</pre>
   <!-- (files-in-below-directory "/usr/local/src/emacs/lisp/") -->
<!-- (files-in-below-directory "/usr/local/share/emacs/22.1.1/lisp/") -->
<p>The <code>files-in-below-directory</code> <code>directory-files</code> function
takes one argument, the name of a directory.

   </p>
<p>Thus, on my system,

<!-- (length (files-in-below-directory "/usr/local/src/emacs/lisp/")) -->
<!-- !!! 22.1.1 lisp sources location here -->
</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (length

`<samp><span class="samp">.el</span></samp>' files.

   </p>
<p><code>files-in-below-directory</code> returns a list in reverse alphabetical
order.  An expression to sort the list in alphabetical order looks
like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (sort
      (files-in-below-directory "/usr/local/share/emacs/22.1.1/lisp/")
      'string-lessp)
</pre>
   <div class="node"><a name="Counting-function-definitions"></a></div>

<h4 class="subsection">14.9.3 Counting function definitions</h4>

<p>Our immediate goal is to generate a list that tells us how many
function definitions contain fewer than 10 words and symbols, how many
contain between 10 and 19 words and symbols, how many contain between
20 and 29 words and symbols, and so on.

   </p>
<p>With a sorted list of numbers, this is easy: count how many elements
of the list are smaller than 10, then, after moving past the numbers
just counted, count how many are smaller than 20, then, after moving
past the numbers just counted, count how many are smaller than 30, and
so on.  Each of the numbers, 10, 20, 30, 40, and the like, is one
larger than the top of that range.  We can call the list of such
numbers the <code>top-of-ranges</code> list.

   </p>
<p>If we wished, we could generate this list automatically, but it is
simpler to write a list manually.  Here it is:
<a name="index-top_002dof_002dranges-291"></a>
</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defvar top-of-ranges
      '(10  20  30  40  50
        60  70  80  90 100
       110 120 130 140 150
       160 170 180 190 200
       210 220 230 240 250
       260 270 280 290 300)
      "List specifying ranges for `defuns-per-range'.")
</pre>
   <p>To change the ranges, we edit this list.

   </p>
<p>Next, we need to write the function that creates the list of the
number of definitions within each range.  Clearly, this function must
take the <code>sorted-lengths</code> and the <code>top-of-ranges</code> lists
as arguments.

   </p>
<p>The <code>defuns-per-range</code> function must do two things again and
again: it must count the number of definitions within a range
specified by the current top-of-range value; and it must shift to the
next higher value in the <code>top-of-ranges</code> list after counting the
number of definitions in the current range.  Since each of these
actions is repetitive, we can use <code>while</code> loops for the job. 
One loop counts the number of definitions in the range defined by the
current top-of-range value, and the other loop selects each of the
top-of-range values in turn.

   </p>
<p>Several entries of the <code>sorted-lengths</code> list are counted for each
range; this means that the loop for the <code>sorted-lengths</code> list
will be inside the loop for the <code>top-of-ranges</code> list, like a
small gear inside a big gear.

   </p>
<p>The inner loop counts the number of definitions within the range.  It
is a simple counting loop of the type we have seen before. 
(See <a href="#Incrementing-Loop">A loop with an incrementing counter</a>.) 
The true-or-false test of the loop tests whether the value from the
<code>sorted-lengths</code> list is smaller than the current value of the
top of the range.  If it is, the function increments the counter and
tests the next value from the <code>sorted-lengths</code> list.

   </p>
<p>The inner loop looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (while <var>length-element-smaller-than-top-of-range</var>
       (setq number-within-range (1+ number-within-range))
       (setq sorted-lengths (cdr sorted-lengths)))
</pre>
   <p>The outer loop must start with the lowest value of the
<code>top-of-ranges</code> list, and then be set to each of the succeeding
higher values in turn.  This can be done with a loop like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (while top-of-ranges
       <var>body-of-loop</var>...
       (setq top-of-ranges (cdr top-of-ranges)))
</pre>
   <p>Put together, the two loops look like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (while top-of-ranges
     
       ;; <span class="roman">Count the number of elements within the current range.</span>
       (while <var>length-element-smaller-than-top-of-range</var>
         (setq number-within-range (1+ number-within-range))
         (setq sorted-lengths (cdr sorted-lengths)))
     
       ;; <span class="roman">Move to next range.</span>
       (setq top-of-ranges (cdr top-of-ranges)))
</pre>
   <p>In addition, in each circuit of the outer loop, Emacs should record
the number of definitions within that range (the value of
<code>number-within-range</code>) in a list.  We can use <code>cons</code> for
this purpose.  (See <a href="#cons"><code>cons</code></a>.)

   </p>
<p>The <code>cons</code> function works fine, except that the list it
constructs will contain the number of definitions for the highest
range at its beginning and the number of definitions for the lowest
range at its end.  This is because <code>cons</code> attaches new elements
of the list to the beginning of the list, and since the two loops are
working their way through the lengths' list from the lower end first,
the <code>defuns-per-range-list</code> will end up largest number first. 
But we will want to print our graph with smallest values first and the
larger later.  The solution is to reverse the order of the
<code>defuns-per-range-list</code>.  We can do this using the
<code>nreverse</code> function, which reverses the order of a list. 
<a name="index-nreverse-292"></a>
For example,

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (nreverse '(1 2 3 4))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">produces:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (4 3 2 1)
</pre>
   <p>Note that the <code>nreverse</code> function is destructive—that is,
it changes the list to which it is applied; this contrasts with the
<code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> functions, which are non-destructive.  In
this case, we do not want the original <code>defuns-per-range-list</code>,
so it does not matter that it is destroyed.  (The <code>reverse</code>
function provides a reversed copy of a list, leaving the original list
as is.) 
<a name="index-reverse-293"></a>
Put all together, the <code>defuns-per-range</code> looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun defuns-per-range (sorted-lengths top-of-ranges)
       "SORTED-LENGTHS defuns in each TOP-OF-RANGES range."

             (number-within-range 0)

         ;; <span class="roman">Outer loop.</span>
         (while top-of-ranges

             ;; <span class="roman">Count number of definitions within current range.</span>
             (setq number-within-range (1+ number-within-range))

         ;; <span class="roman">Return a list of the number of definitions within each range,</span>
         ;; <span class="roman">  smallest to largest.</span>
         (nreverse defuns-per-range-list)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The function is straightforward except for one subtle feature.  The
true-or-false test of the inner loop looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (and (car sorted-lengths)
          (&lt; (car sorted-lengths) top-of-range))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">instead of like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (&lt; (car sorted-lengths) top-of-range)
</pre>
   <p>The purpose of the test is to determine whether the first item in the
<code>sorted-lengths</code> list is less than the value of the top of the
range.

   </p>
<p>The simple version of the test works fine unless the
<code>sorted-lengths</code> list has a <code>nil</code> value.  In that case, the
<code>(car sorted-lengths)</code> expression function returns
<code>nil</code>.  The <code>&lt;</code> function cannot compare a number to
<code>nil</code>, which is an empty list, so Emacs signals an error and
stops the function from attempting to continue to execute.

   </p>
<p>The <code>sorted-lengths</code> list always becomes <code>nil</code> when the
counter reaches the end of the list.  This means that any attempt to
use the <code>defuns-per-range</code> function with the simple version of
the test will fail.

   </p>
<p>We solve the problem by using the <code>(car sorted-lengths)</code>
expression in conjunction with the <code>and</code> expression.  The
<code>(car sorted-lengths)</code> expression returns a non-<code>nil</code>
value so long as the list has at least one number within it, but
returns <code>nil</code> if the list is empty.  The <code>and</code> expression
first evaluates the <code>(car sorted-lengths)</code> expression, and
if it is <code>nil</code>, returns false <em>without</em> evaluating the
<code>&lt;</code> expression.  But if the <code>(car sorted-lengths)</code>
expression returns a non-<code>nil</code> value, the <code>and</code> expression
evaluates the <code>&lt;</code> expression, and returns that value as the value
of the <code>and</code> expression.

<!-- colon in printed section title causes problem in Info cross reference -->
</p>
<p>This way, we avoid an error.

   </p>
<p>Here is a short test of the <code>defuns-per-range</code> function.  First,
evaluate the expression that binds (a shortened)
<code>top-of-ranges</code> list to the list of values, then evaluate the
expression for binding the <code>sorted-lengths</code> list, and then
evaluate the <code>defuns-per-range</code> function.

Our goal is to construct a graph showing the numbers of function
definitions of various lengths in the Emacs lisp sources.

   </p>
<p>As a practical matter, if you were creating a graph, you would
probably use a program such as <code>gnuplot</code> to do the job. 
(<code>gnuplot</code> is nicely integrated into GNU Emacs.)  In this case,
however, we create one from scratch, and in the process we will
re-acquaint ourselves with some of what we learned before and learn
more.

   </p>
<p>In this chapter, we will first write a simple graph printing function. 
This first definition will be a <dfn>prototype</dfn>, a rapidly written
function that enables us to reconnoiter this unknown graph-making
territory.  We will discover dragons, or find that they are myth. 
After scouting the terrain, we will feel more confident and enhance
the function to label the axes automatically.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Printing the Columns of a Graph</h3>

   <p>Since Emacs is designed to be flexible and work with all kinds of
terminals, including character-only terminals, the graph will need to
be made from one of the typewriter symbols.  An asterisk will do; as
we enhance the graph-printing function, we can make the choice of
symbol a user option.

   </p>
<p>We can call this function <code>graph-body-print</code>; it will take a
<code>numbers-list</code> as its only argument.  At this stage, we will not
label the graph, but only print its body.

   </p>
<p>The <code>graph-body-print</code> function inserts a vertical column of
asterisks for each element in the <code>numbers-list</code>.  The height of
each line is determined by the value of that element of the
<code>numbers-list</code>.

   </p>
<p>Inserting columns is a repetitive act; that means that this function can
be written either with a <code>while</code> loop or recursively.

   </p>
<p>Our first challenge is to discover how to print a column of asterisks. 
Usually, in Emacs, we print characters onto a screen horizontally,
line by line, by typing.  We have two routes we can follow: write our
own column-insertion function or discover whether one exists in Emacs.

   </p>
<p>To see whether there is one in Emacs, we can use the <kbd>M-x apropos</kbd>
command.  This command is like the <kbd>C-h a</kbd> (<code>command-apropos</code>)
command, except that the latter finds only those functions that are
commands.  The <kbd>M-x apropos</kbd> command lists all symbols that match
a regular expression, including functions that are not interactive. 
<a name="index-apropos-298"></a>
What we want to look for is some command that prints or inserts
columns.  Very likely, the name of the function will contain either
the word “print” or the word “insert” or the word “column”. 
Therefore, we can simply type <kbd>M-x apropos RET
print\|insert\|column RET</kbd> and look at the result.  On my system, this
command once took quite some time, and then produced a list of 79
functions and variables.  Now it does not take much time at all and
produces a list of 211 functions and variables.  Scanning down the
list, the only function that looks as if it might do the job is
<code>insert-rectangle</code>.

   </p>
<p>Indeed, this is the function we want; its documentation says:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     insert-rectangle:
     Insert text of RECTANGLE with upper left corner at point.
     RECTANGLE's first line is inserted at point,
     its second line is inserted at a point vertically under point, etc.
     RECTANGLE should be a list of strings.
     After this command, the mark is at the upper left corner
     and point is at the lower right corner.
</pre>
   <p>We can run a quick test, to make sure it does what we expect of it.

   </p>
<p>Here is the result of placing the cursor after the
<code>insert-rectangle</code> expression and typing <kbd>C-u C-x C-e</kbd>
(<code>eval-last-sexp</code>).  The function inserts the strings
`<samp><span class="samp">"first"</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">"second"</span></samp>', and `<samp><span class="samp">"third"</span></samp>' at and below
point.  Also the function returns <code>nil</code>.

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (insert-rectangle '("first" "second" "third"))first
                                                   second
                                                   thirdnil
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Of course, we won't be inserting the text of the
<code>insert-rectangle</code> expression itself into the buffer in which we
are making the graph, but will call the function from our program.  We
shall, however, have to make sure that point is in the buffer at the
place where the <code>insert-rectangle</code> function will insert its
column of strings.

   </p>
<p>If you are reading this in Info, you can see how this works by
switching to another buffer, such as the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer,
placing point somewhere in the buffer, typing <kbd>M-:</kbd>, typing the
<code>insert-rectangle</code> expression into the minibuffer at the prompt,
and then typing &lt;RET&gt;.  This causes Emacs to evaluate the
expression in the minibuffer, but to use as the value of point the
position of point in the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer.  (<kbd>M-:</kbd>  is the
keybinding for <code>eval-expression</code>. Also, <code>nil</code> does not
appear in the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer since the expression is
evaluated in the minibuffer.)

   </p>
<p>We find when we do this that point ends up at the end of the last
inserted line—that is to say, this function moves point as a
side-effect.  If we were to repeat the command, with point at this
position, the next insertion would be below and to the right of the
previous insertion.  We don't want this!  If we are going to make a
bar graph, the columns need to be beside each other.

   </p>
<p>So we discover that each cycle of the column-inserting <code>while</code>
loop must reposition point to the place we want it, and that place
will be at the top, not the bottom, of the column.  Moreover, we
remember that when we print a graph, we do not expect all the columns
to be the same height.  This means that the top of each column may be
at a different height from the previous one.  We cannot simply
reposition point to the same line each time, but moved over to the
right—or perhaps we can<small class="dots">...</small>

   </p>
<p>We are planning to make the columns of the bar graph out of asterisks. 
The number of asterisks in the column is the number specified by the
current element of the <code>numbers-list</code>.  We need to construct a
list of asterisks of the right length for each call to
<code>insert-rectangle</code>.  If this list consists solely of the requisite
number of asterisks, then we will have to position point the right number
of lines above the base for the graph to print correctly.  This could
be difficult.

   </p>
<p>Alternatively, if we can figure out some way to pass
<code>insert-rectangle</code> a list of the same length each time, then we
can place point on the same line each time, but move it over one
column to the right for each new column.  If we do this, however, some
of the entries in the list passed to <code>insert-rectangle</code> must be
blanks rather than asterisks.  For example, if the maximum height of
the graph is 5, but the height of the column is 3, then
<code>insert-rectangle</code> requires an argument that looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (" " " " "*" "*" "*")
</pre>
   <p>This last proposal is not so difficult, so long as we can determine
the column height.  There are two ways for us to specify the column
height: we can arbitrarily state what it will be, which would work
fine for graphs of that height; or we can search through the list of
numbers and use the maximum height of the list as the maximum height
of the graph.  If the latter operation were difficult, then the former
procedure would be easiest, but there is a function built into Emacs
that determines the maximum of its arguments.  We can use that
function.  The function is called <code>max</code> and it returns the
largest of all its arguments, which must be numbers.  Thus, for
example,

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (max  3 4 6 5 7 3)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">returns 7.  (A corresponding function called <code>min</code> returns the
smallest of all its arguments.) 
<a name="index-max-299"></a><a name="index-min-300"></a>
However, we cannot simply call <code>max</code> on the <code>numbers-list</code>;
the <code>max</code> function expects numbers as its argument, not a list of
numbers.  Thus, the following expression,

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (max  '(3 4 6 5 7 3))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">produces the following error message;

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     Wrong type of argument:  number-or-marker-p, (3 4 6 5 7 3)
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-apply-301"></a>We need a function that passes a list of arguments to a function. 
This function is <code>apply</code>.  This function applies its first
argument (a function) to its remaining arguments, the last of which
may be a list.

   </p>
<p>For example,

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (apply 'max 3 4 7 3 '(4 8 5))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">returns 8.

   </p>
<p>(Incidentally, I don't know how you would learn of this function
without a book such as this.  It is possible to discover other
functions, like <code>search-forward</code> or <code>insert-rectangle</code>, by
guessing at a part of their names and then using <code>apropos</code>.  Even
though its base in metaphor is clear—apply its first argument to
the rest—I doubt a novice would come up with that particular word
when using <code>apropos</code> or other aid.  Of course, I could be wrong;
after all, the function was first named by someone who had to invent
it.)

   </p>
<p>The second and subsequent arguments to <code>apply</code> are optional, so
we can use <code>apply</code> to call a function and pass the elements of a
list to it, like this, which also returns 8:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (apply 'max '(4 8 5))
</pre>
   <p>This latter way is how we will use <code>apply</code>.  The
<code>recursive-lengths-list-many-files</code> function returns a numbers'
list to which we can apply <code>max</code> (we could also apply <code>max</code> to
the sorted numbers' list; it does not matter whether the list is
sorted or not.)

   </p>
<p>Hence, the operation for finding the maximum height of the graph is this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setq max-graph-height (apply 'max numbers-list))
</pre>
   <p>Now we can return to the question of how to create a list of strings
for a column of the graph.  Told the maximum height of the graph
and the number of asterisks that should appear in the column, the
function should return a list of strings for the
<code>insert-rectangle</code> command to insert.

   </p>
<p>Each column is made up of asterisks or blanks.  Since the function is
passed the value of the height of the column and the number of
asterisks in the column, the number of blanks can be found by
subtracting the number of asterisks from the height of the column. 
Given the number of blanks and the number of asterisks, two
<code>while</code> loops can be used to construct the list:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ;;; <span class="roman">First version.</span>
     (defun column-of-graph (max-graph-height actual-height)
       "Return list of strings that is one column of a graph."
       (let ((insert-list nil)
             (number-of-top-blanks
              (- max-graph-height actual-height)))
     
         ;; <span class="roman">Fill in asterisks.</span>
         (while (&gt; actual-height 0)
           (setq insert-list (cons "*" insert-list))
           (setq actual-height (1- actual-height)))
     
         ;; <span class="roman">Fill in blanks.</span>
         (while (&gt; number-of-top-blanks 0)
           (setq insert-list (cons " " insert-list))
           (setq number-of-top-blanks
                 (1- number-of-top-blanks)))
     
         ;; <span class="roman">Return whole list.</span>
         insert-list))
</pre>
   <p>If you install this function and then evaluate the following
expression you will see that it returns the list as desired:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (column-of-graph 5 3)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">returns

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (" " " " "*" "*" "*")
</pre>
   <p>As written, <code>column-of-graph</code> contains a major flaw: the symbols
used for the blank and for the marked entries in the column are
hard-coded as a space and asterisk.  This is fine for a prototype,
but you, or another user, may wish to use other symbols.  For example,
in testing the graph function, you may want to use a period in place
of the space, to make sure the point is being repositioned properly
each time the <code>insert-rectangle</code> function is called; or you might
want to substitute a `<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>' sign or other symbol for the asterisk. 
You might even want to make a graph-column that is more than one
display column wide.  The program should be more flexible.  The way to
do that is to replace the blank and the asterisk with two variables
that we can call <code>graph-blank</code> and <code>graph-symbol</code> and define
those variables separately.

   </p>
<p>Also, the documentation is not well written.  These considerations
lead us to the second version of the function:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defvar graph-symbol "*"
       "String used as symbol in graph, usually an asterisk.")
     
     (defvar graph-blank " "
       "String used as blank in graph, usually a blank space.
     graph-blank must be the same number of columns wide
     as graph-symbol.")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(For an explanation of <code>defvar</code>, see
<a href="#defvar">Initializing a Variable with <code>defvar</code></a>.)

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ;;; <span class="roman">Second version.</span>
     (defun column-of-graph (max-graph-height actual-height)
       "Return MAX-GRAPH-HEIGHT strings; ACTUAL-HEIGHT are graph-symbols.
     The graph-symbols are contiguous entries at the end
     of the list.
     The list will be inserted as one column of a graph.
     The strings are either graph-blank or graph-symbol."
     
       (let ((insert-list nil)
             (number-of-top-blanks
              (- max-graph-height actual-height)))
     
         ;; <span class="roman">Fill in </span><code>graph-symbols</code><span class="roman">.</span>
         (while (&gt; actual-height 0)
           (setq insert-list (cons graph-symbol insert-list))
           (setq actual-height (1- actual-height)))
     
         ;; <span class="roman">Fill in </span><code>graph-blanks</code><span class="roman">.</span>
         (while (&gt; number-of-top-blanks 0)
           (setq insert-list (cons graph-blank insert-list))
           (setq number-of-top-blanks
                 (1- number-of-top-blanks)))
     
         ;; <span class="roman">Return whole list.</span>
         insert-list))
</pre>
   <p>If we wished, we could rewrite <code>column-of-graph</code> a third time to
provide optionally for a line graph as well as for a bar graph.  This
would not be hard to do.  One way to think of a line graph is that it
is no more than a bar graph in which the part of each bar that is
below the top is blank.  To construct a column for a line graph, the
function first constructs a list of blanks that is one shorter than
the value, then it uses <code>cons</code> to attach a graph symbol to the
list; then it uses <code>cons</code> again to attach the top blanks to
the list.

   </p>
<p>It is easy to see how to write such a function, but since we don't
need it, we will not do it.  But the job could be done, and if it were
done, it would be done with <code>column-of-graph</code>.  Even more
important, it is worth noting that few changes would have to be made
anywhere else.  The enhancement, if we ever wish to make it, is
simple.

   </p>
<p>Now, finally, we come to our first actual graph printing function. 
This prints the body of a graph, not the labels for the vertical and
horizontal axes, so we can call this <code>graph-body-print</code>.

</p>
<div class="node">
<a name="graph-body-print"></a><a name="graph_002dbody_002dprint"></a>
</div>

<h3 class="section">15.1 The <code>graph-body-print</code> Function</h3>

<p><a name="index-graph_002dbody_002dprint-302"></a>
After our preparation in the preceding section, the
<code>graph-body-print</code> function is straightforward.  The function
will print column after column of asterisks and blanks, using the
elements of a numbers' list to specify the number of asterisks in each
column.  This is a repetitive act, which means we can use a
decrementing <code>while</code> loop or recursive function for the job.  In
this section, we will write the definition using a <code>while</code> loop.

   </p>
<p>The <code>column-of-graph</code> function requires the height of the graph
as an argument, so we should determine and record that as a local variable.

   </p>
<p>This leads us to the following template for the <code>while</code> loop
version of this function:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun graph-body-print (numbers-list)
       "<var>documentation</var>..."
       (let ((height  ...
              ...))
     
         (while numbers-list
           <var>insert-columns-and-reposition-point</var>
           (setq numbers-list (cdr numbers-list)))))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">We need to fill in the slots of the template.

   </p>
<p>Clearly, we can use the <code>(apply 'max numbers-list)</code> expression to
determine the height of the graph.

   </p>
<p>The <code>while</code> loop will cycle through the <code>numbers-list</code> one
element at a time.  As it is shortened by the <code>(setq numbers-list
(cdr numbers-list))</code> expression, the <span class="sc">car</span> of each instance of the
list is the value of the argument for <code>column-of-graph</code>.

   </p>
<p>At each cycle of the <code>while</code> loop, the <code>insert-rectangle</code>
function inserts the list returned by <code>column-of-graph</code>.  Since
the <code>insert-rectangle</code> function moves point to the lower right of
the inserted rectangle, we need to save the location of point at the
time the rectangle is inserted, move back to that position after the
rectangle is inserted, and then move horizontally to the next place
from which <code>insert-rectangle</code> is called.

   </p>
<p>If the inserted columns are one character wide, as they will be if
single blanks and asterisks are used, the repositioning command is
simply <code>(forward-char 1)</code>; however, the width of a column may be
greater than one.  This means that the repositioning command should be
written <code>(forward-char symbol-width)</code>.  The <code>symbol-width</code>
itself is the length of a <code>graph-blank</code> and can be found using
the expression <code>(length graph-blank)</code>.  The best place to bind
the <code>symbol-width</code> variable to the value of the width of graph
column is in the varlist of the <code>let</code> expression.

   </p>
<p>These considerations lead to the following function definition:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun graph-body-print (numbers-list)
       "Print a bar graph of the NUMBERS-LIST.
     The numbers-list consists of the Y-axis values."
     
       (let ((height (apply 'max numbers-list))
             (symbol-width (length graph-blank))
             from-position)
     
         (while numbers-list
           (setq from-position (point))
           (insert-rectangle
            (column-of-graph height (car numbers-list)))
           (goto-char from-position)
           (forward-char symbol-width)
           ;; <span class="roman">Draw graph column by column.</span>
           (sit-for 0)
           (setq numbers-list (cdr numbers-list)))
         ;; <span class="roman">Place point for X axis labels.</span>
         (forward-line height)
         (insert "\n")
     ))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The one unexpected expression in this function is the
<code>(sit-for 0)</code><!-- /@w --> expression in the <code>while</code> loop.  This
expression makes the graph printing operation more interesting to
watch than it would be otherwise.  The expression causes Emacs to
<dfn>sit</dfn> or do nothing for a zero length of time and then redraw the
screen.  Placed here, it causes Emacs to redraw the screen column by
column.  Without it, Emacs would not redraw the screen until the
function exits.

   </p>
<p>We can test <code>graph-body-print</code> with a short list of numbers.

     </p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Install <code>graph-symbol</code>, <code>graph-blank</code>,
<code>column-of-graph</code>, which are in

<p><a name="index-recursive_002dgraph_002dbody_002dprint-303"></a>
The <code>graph-body-print</code> function may also be written recursively. 
The recursive solution is divided into two parts: an outside wrapper
that uses a <code>let</code> expression to determine the values of several
variables that need only be found once, such as the maximum height of
the graph, and an inside function that is called recursively to print
the graph.

   <p>The recursive function is a little more difficult.  It has four parts:
the do-again-test, the printing code, the recursive call, and the
next-step-expression.  The do-again-test is a <code>when</code>
expression that determines whether the <code>numbers-list</code> contains
any remaining elements; if it does, the function prints one column of
the graph using the printing code and calls itself again.  The
function calls itself again according to the value produced by the
next-step-expression which causes the call to act on a shorter
version of the <code>numbers-list</code>.

<h3 class="section">15.3 Need for Printed Axes</h3>

<p>A graph needs printed axes, so you can orient yourself.  For a do-once
project, it may be reasonable to draw the axes by hand using Emacs's
Picture mode; but a graph drawing function may be used more than once.

   </p>
<p>For this reason, I have written enhancements to the basic
<code>print-graph-body</code> function that automatically print labels for
the horizontal and vertical axes.  Since the label printing functions
do not contain much new material, I have placed their description in
an appendix.  See <a href="#Full-Graph">A Graph with Labeled Axes</a>.

“You don't have to like Emacs to like it”—this seemingly
paradoxical statement is the secret of GNU Emacs.  The plain, out-of-the-box
Emacs is a generic tool.  Most people who use it customize
it to suit themselves.

   </p>
<p>GNU Emacs is mostly written in Emacs Lisp; this means that by writing
expressions in Emacs Lisp you can change or extend Emacs.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Emacs's Default Configuration</h3>

   <p>There are those who appreciate Emacs's default configuration.  After
all, Emacs starts you in C mode when you edit a C file, starts you in
Fortran mode when you edit a Fortran file, and starts you in
Fundamental mode when you edit an unadorned file.  This all makes
sense, if you do not know who is going to use Emacs.  Who knows what a
person hopes to do with an unadorned file?  Fundamental mode is the
right default for such a file, just as C mode is the right default for
editing C code.  (Enough programming languages have syntaxes
that enable them to share or nearly share features, so C mode is
now provided by CC mode, the C Collection.)

   </p>
<p>But when you do know who is going to use Emacs—you,
yourself—then it makes sense to customize Emacs.

   </p>
<p>For example, I seldom want Fundamental mode when I edit an
otherwise undistinguished file; I want Text mode.  This is why I
customize Emacs: so it suits me.

   </p>
<p>You can customize and extend Emacs by writing or adapting a
<samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> file.  This is your personal initialization file; its
contents, written in Emacs Lisp, tell Emacs what to do.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-14" name="fnd-14"><sup>14</sup></a>

   </p>
<p>A <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> file contains Emacs Lisp code.  You can write this
code yourself; or you can use Emacs's <code>customize</code> feature to write
the code for you.  You can combine your own expressions and
auto-written Customize expressions in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file.

   </p>
<p>(I myself prefer to write my own expressions, except for those,
particularly fonts, that I find easier to manipulate using the
<code>customize</code> command.  I combine the two methods.)

   </p>
<p>Most of this chapter is about writing expressions yourself.  It
describes a simple <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file; for more information, see
<a href="emacs.html#Init-File">The Init File</a>, and
<a href="elisp.html#Init-File">The Init File</a>.

loads various site-wide initialization files, if they exist.  These
have the same form as your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file, but are loaded by
everyone.

   </p>
<p>Two site-wide initialization files, <samp><span class="file">site-load.el</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">site-init.el</span></samp>, are loaded into Emacs and then dumped if a
dumped version of Emacs is created, as is most common.  (Dumped
copies of Emacs load more quickly.  However, once a file is loaded and
dumped, a change to it does not lead to a change in Emacs unless you
load it yourself or re-dump Emacs.  See <a href="elisp.html#Building-Emacs">Building Emacs</a>, and the
<samp><span class="file">INSTALL</span></samp> file.)

   </p>
<p>Three other site-wide initialization files are loaded automatically
each time you start Emacs, if they exist.  These are
<samp><span class="file">site-start.el</span></samp>, which is loaded <em>before</em> your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>
file, and <samp><span class="file">default.el</span></samp>, and the terminal type file, which are both
loaded <em>after</em> your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file.

   </p>
<p>Settings and definitions in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file will overwrite
conflicting settings and definitions in a <samp><span class="file">site-start.el</span></samp> file,
if it exists; but the settings and definitions in a <samp><span class="file">default.el</span></samp>
or terminal type file will overwrite those in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file. 
(You can prevent interference from a terminal type file by setting
<code>term-file-prefix</code> to <code>nil</code>.  See <a href="#Simple-Extension">A Simple Extension</a>.)

<!-- Rewritten to avoid overfull hbox. -->
</p>
<p>The <samp><span class="file">INSTALL</span></samp> file that comes in the distribution contains
descriptions of the <samp><span class="file">site-init.el</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">site-load.el</span></samp> files.

   </p>
<p>The <samp><span class="file">loadup.el</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">startup.el</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="file">loaddefs.el</span></samp> files
control loading.  These files are in the <samp><span class="file">lisp</span></samp> directory of the
Emacs distribution and are worth perusing.

   </p>
<p>The <samp><span class="file">loaddefs.el</span></samp> file contains a good many suggestions as to
what to put into your own <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file, or into a site-wide
initialization file.

<div class="node"><a name="defcustom"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">16.2 Specifying Variables using <code>defcustom</code>
</h3>

<p><a name="index-defcustom-310"></a>
You can specify variables using <code>defcustom</code> so that you and
others can then use Emacs's <code>customize</code> feature to set their
values.  (You cannot use <code>customize</code> to write function
definitions; but you can write <code>defuns</code> in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>
file.  Indeed, you can write any Lisp expression in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>
file.)

   </p>
<p>The <code>customize</code> feature depends on the <code>defcustom</code> macro. 
Although you can use <code>defvar</code> or <code>setq</code> for variables that
users set, the <code>defcustom</code> macro is designed for the job.

   </p>
<p>You can use your knowledge of <code>defvar</code> for writing the
first three arguments for <code>defcustom</code>.  The first argument to
<code>defcustom</code> is the name of the variable.  The second argument is
the variable's initial value, if any; and this value is set only if
the value has not already been set.  The third argument is the
documentation.

   </p>
<p>The fourth and subsequent arguments to <code>defcustom</code> specify types
and options; these are not featured in <code>defvar</code>.  (These
arguments are optional.)

   </p>
<p>Each of these arguments consists of a keyword followed by a value. 
Each keyword starts with the colon character `<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>'.

   </p>
<p>For example, the customizable user option variable
<code>text-mode-hook</code> looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defcustom text-mode-hook nil
       "Normal hook run when entering Text mode and many related modes."
       :type 'hook
       :options '(turn-on-auto-fill flyspell-mode)
       :group 'wp)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The name of the variable is <code>text-mode-hook</code>; it has no default
value; and its documentation string tells you what it does.

   </p>
<p>The <code>:type</code> keyword tells Emacs the kind of data to which
<code>text-mode-hook</code> should be set and how to display the value in a
Customization buffer.

   </p>
<p>The <code>:options</code> keyword specifies a suggested list of values for
the variable.  Usually, <code>:options</code> applies to a hook. 
The list is only a suggestion; it is not exclusive; a person who sets
the variable may set it to other values; the list shown following the
<code>:options</code> keyword is intended to offer convenient choices to a
user.

   </p>
<p>Finally, the <code>:group</code> keyword tells the Emacs Customization
command in which group the variable is located.  This tells where to
find it.

   </p>
<p>The <code>defcustom</code> macro recognizes more than a dozen keywords. 
For more information, see <a href="elisp.html#Customization">Writing Customization Definitions</a>.

   </p>
<p>Consider <code>text-mode-hook</code> as an example.

   </p>
<p>There are two ways to customize this variable.  You can use the
customization command or write the appropriate expressions yourself.

   </p>
<p>Using the customization command,  you can type:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     M-x customize
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and find that the group for editing files of text is called “Text”. 
Enter that group.  Text Mode Hook is the first member.  You can click
on its various options, such as <code>turn-on-auto-fill</code>, to set the
values.  After you click on the button to

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     Save for Future Sessions
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Emacs will write an expression into your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file. 
It will look like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (custom-set-variables
       ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
       ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
       ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
       ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
      '(text-mode-hook (quote (turn-on-auto-fill text-mode-hook-identify))))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(The <code>text-mode-hook-identify</code> function tells
<code>toggle-text-mode-auto-fill</code> which buffers are in Text mode. 
It comes on automatically.)

   </p>
<p>The <code>custom-set-variables</code> function works somewhat differently
than a <code>setq</code>.  While I have never learned the differences, I
modify the <code>custom-set-variables</code> expressions in my <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>
file by hand:  I make the changes in what appears to me to be a
reasonable manner and have not had any problems.  Others prefer to use
the Customization command and let Emacs do the work for them.

   </p>
<p>Another <code>custom-set-...</code> function is <code>custom-set-faces</code>. 
This function sets the various font faces.  Over time, I have set a
considerable number of faces.  Some of the time, I re-set them using
<code>customize</code>; other times, I simply edit the
<code>custom-set-faces</code> expression in my <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file itself.

   </p>
<p>The second way to customize your <code>text-mode-hook</code> is to set it
yourself in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file using code that has nothing to do
with the <code>custom-set-...</code> functions.

   </p>
<p>When you do this, and later use <code>customize</code>, you will see a
message that says

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     CHANGED outside Customize; operating on it here may be unreliable.
</pre>
   <p>This message is only a warning.  If you click on the button to

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     Save for Future Sessions
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Emacs will write a <code>custom-set-...</code> expression near the end
of your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file that will be evaluated after your
hand-written expression.  It will, therefore, overrule your
hand-written expression.  No harm will be done.  When you do this,
however, be careful to remember which expression is active; if you
forget, you may confuse yourself.

   </p>
<p>So long as you remember where the values are set, you will have no
trouble.  In any event, the values are always set in your
initialization file, which is usually called <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>.

   </p>
<p>I myself use <code>customize</code> for hardly anything.  Mostly, I write
expressions myself.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-defsubst-311"></a><a name="index-defconst-312"></a>Incidentally, to be more complete concerning defines:  <code>defsubst</code>
defines an inline function.  The syntax is just like that of
<code>defun</code>.  <code>defconst</code> defines a symbol as a constant.  The
intent is that neither programs nor users should ever change a value
set by <code>defconst</code>.  (You can change it; the value set is a
variable; but please do not.)

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007b_002eemacs_007d-file_002c-beginning-of-313"></a>
When you start Emacs, it loads your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file unless you tell
it not to by specifying `<samp><span class="samp">-q</span></samp>' on the command line.  (The
<code>emacs -q</code> command gives you a plain, out-of-the-box Emacs.)

   </p>
<p>A <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file contains Lisp expressions.  Often, these are no
more than expressions to set values; sometimes they are function
definitions.

   </p>
<p>See <a href="emacs.html#Init-File">The Init File <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp></a>, for a short description of initialization files.

   </p>
<p>This chapter goes over some of the same ground, but is a walk among
extracts from a complete, long-used <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file—my own.

   </p>
<p>The first part of the file consists of comments: reminders to myself. 
By now, of course, I remember these things, but when I started, I did
not.

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ;;;; Bob's .emacs file
     ; Robert J. Chassell
     ; 26 September 1985
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Look at that date!  I started this file a long time ago.  I have been
adding to it ever since.

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ; Each section in this file is introduced by a
     ; line beginning with four semicolons; and each
     ; entry is introduced by a line beginning with
     ; three semicolons.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This describes the usual conventions for comments in Emacs Lisp. 
Everything on a line that follows a semicolon is a comment.  Two,
three, and four semicolons are used as subsection and section markers. 
(See <a href="elisp.html#Comments">Comments</a>, for
more about comments.)

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ;;;; The Help Key
     ; Control-h is the help key;
     ; after typing control-h, type a letter to

     ; For an explanation of the help facility,

</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Just remember: type <kbd>C-h</kbd> two times for help.

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ; To find out about any mode, type control-h m

   <p class="noindent">“Mode help”, as I call this, is very helpful.  Usually, it tells you
all you need to know.

   </p>
<p>Of course, you don't need to include comments like these in your
<samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file.  I included them in mine because I kept forgetting
about Mode help or the conventions for comments—but I was able to
remember to look here to remind myself.

<h3 class="section">16.4 Text and Auto Fill Mode</h3>

<p>Now we come to the part that turns on Text mode and
Auto Fill mode.

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ;;; Text mode and Auto Fill mode
     ;; The next two lines put Emacs into Text mode
     ;; and Auto Fill mode, and are for writers who
     ;; want to start writing prose rather than code.
     (setq-default major-mode 'text-mode)
     (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)
</pre>
   <p>Here is the first part of this <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file that does something
besides remind a forgetful human!

   </p>
<p>The first of the two lines in parentheses tells Emacs to turn on Text
mode when you find a file, <em>unless</em> that file should go into some
other mode, such as C mode.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-Per_002dbuffer_002c-local-variables-list-314"></a><a name="index-Local-variables-list_002c-per_002dbuffer_002c-315"></a><a name="index-Automatic-mode-selection-316"></a><a name="index-Mode-selection_002c-automatic-317"></a>When Emacs reads a file, it looks at the extension to the file name,
if any.  (The extension is the part that comes after a `<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>'.)  If
the file ends with a `<samp><span class="samp">.c</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">.h</span></samp>' extension then Emacs turns
on C mode.  Also, Emacs looks at first nonblank line of the file; if
the line says `<samp><span class="samp">-*- C -*-</span></samp>'<!-- /@w -->, Emacs turns on C mode.  Emacs
possesses a list of extensions and specifications that it uses
automatically.  In addition, Emacs looks near the last page for a
per-buffer, local variables list, if any.

   </p>
<p>Now, back to the <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file.

   </p>
<p>Here is the line again; how does it work?

   </p>
<p><a name="index-Text-Mode-turned-on-318"></a>
</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setq major-mode 'text-mode)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This line is a short, but complete Emacs Lisp expression.

   </p>
<p>We are already familiar with <code>setq</code>.  It sets the following variable,
<code>major-mode</code>, to the subsequent value, which is <code>text-mode</code>. 
The single-quote before <code>text-mode</code> tells Emacs to deal directly
with the <code>text-mode</code> symbol, not with whatever it might stand for. 
See <a href="#set-_0026-setq">Setting the Value of a Variable</a>,
for a reminder of how <code>setq</code> works. 
The main point is that there is no difference between the procedure you
use to set a value in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file and the procedure you use
anywhere else in Emacs.

   </p>
<p>Here is the next line:

   </p>
<p><a name="index-Auto-Fill-mode-turned-on-319"></a><a name="index-add_002dhook-320"></a>
</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this line, the <code>add-hook</code> command adds
<code>turn-on-auto-fill</code> to the variable.

   </p>
<p><code>turn-on-auto-fill</code> is the name of a program, that, you guessed
it!, turns on Auto Fill mode.

   </p>
<p>Every time Emacs turns on Text mode, Emacs runs the commands hooked
onto Text mode.  So every time Emacs turns on Text mode, Emacs also
turns on Auto Fill mode.

   </p>
<p>In brief, the first line causes Emacs to enter Text mode when you edit a
file, unless the file name extension, a first non-blank line, or local
variables to tell Emacs otherwise.

   </p>
<p>Text mode among other actions, sets the syntax table to work
conveniently for writers.  In Text mode, Emacs considers an apostrophe
as part of a word like a letter; but Emacs does not consider a period
or a space as part of a word.  Thus, <kbd>M-f</kbd> moves you over
`<samp><span class="samp">it's</span></samp>'.  On the other hand, in C mode, <kbd>M-f</kbd> stops just after
the `<samp><span class="samp">t</span></samp>' of `<samp><span class="samp">it's</span></samp>'.

   </p>
<p>The second line causes Emacs to turn on Auto Fill mode when it turns
on Text mode.  In Auto Fill mode, Emacs automatically breaks a line
that is too wide and brings the excessively wide part of the line down
to the next line.  Emacs breaks lines between words, not within them.

   </p>
<p>When Auto Fill mode is turned off, lines continue to the right as you
type them.  Depending on how you set the value of
<code>truncate-lines</code>, the words you type either disappear off the
right side of the screen, or else are shown, in a rather ugly and
unreadable manner, as a continuation line on the screen.

   </p>
<p>In addition, in this part of my <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file, I tell the Emacs
fill commands to insert two spaces after a colon:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setq colon-double-space t)
</pre>
   <div class="node"><a name="Mail-Aliases"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">16.5 Mail Aliases</h3>

<p>Here is a <code>setq</code> that turns on mail aliases, along with more
reminders.

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ;;; Mail mode
     ; To enter mail mode, type 'C-x m'
     ; To enter RMAIL (for reading mail),
     ; type 'M-x rmail'
     (setq mail-aliases t)
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-Mail-aliases-321"></a>This <code>setq</code> command sets the value of the variable
<code>mail-aliases</code> to <code>t</code>.  Since <code>t</code> means true, the line
says, in effect, “Yes, use mail aliases.”

   </p>
<p>Mail aliases are convenient short names for long email addresses or
for lists of email addresses.  The file where you keep your aliases
is <samp><span class="file">~/.mailrc</span></samp>.  You write an alias like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     alias geo george@foobar.wiz.edu
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">When you write a message to George, address it to `<samp><span class="samp">geo</span></samp>'; the
mailer will automatically expand `<samp><span class="samp">geo</span></samp>' to the full address.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Indent-Tabs-Mode"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">16.6 Indent Tabs Mode</h3>

<p><a name="index-Tabs_002c-preventing-322"></a><a name="index-indent_002dtabs_002dmode-323"></a>
By default, Emacs inserts tabs in place of multiple spaces when it
formats a region.  (For example, you might indent many lines of text
all at once with the <code>indent-region</code> command.)  Tabs look fine on
a terminal or with ordinary printing, but they produce badly indented
output when you use TeX or Texinfo since TeX ignores tabs.

   </p>
<p>The following turns off Indent Tabs mode:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ;;; Prevent Extraneous Tabs
     (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)
</pre>
   <p>Note that this line uses <code>setq-default</code> rather than the
<code>setq</code> command that we have seen before.  The <code>setq-default</code>
command sets values only in buffers that do not have their own local
values for the variable.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Keybindings"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">16.7 Some Keybindings</h3>

<p>Now for some personal keybindings:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ;;; Compare windows
     (global-set-key "\C-cw" 'compare-windows)
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-compare_002dwindows-324"></a><code>compare-windows</code> is a nifty command that compares the text in
your current window with text in the next window.  It makes the
comparison by starting at point in each window, moving over text in
each window as far as they match.  I use this command all the time.

   </p>
<p>This also shows how to set a key globally, for all modes.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-Setting-a-key-globally-325"></a><a name="index-Global-set-key-326"></a><a name="index-Key-setting-globally-327"></a><a name="index-global_002dset_002dkey-328"></a>The command is <code>global-set-key</code>.  It is followed by the
keybinding.  In a <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file, the keybinding is written as
shown: <code>\C-c</code> stands for Control-C, which means to press the
control key and the &lt;c&gt; key at the same time.  The <code>w</code> means
to press the &lt;w&gt; key.  The keybinding is surrounded by double
quotation marks.  In documentation, you would write this as
<kbd>C-c w</kbd><!-- /@w -->.  (If you were binding a &lt;META&gt; key, such as
<kbd>M-c</kbd>, rather than a &lt;CTRL&gt; key, you would write
<code>\M-c</code><!-- /@w --> in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file.  See <a href="emacs.html#Init-Rebinding">Rebinding Keys in Your Init File</a>, for
details.)

   </p>
<p>The command invoked by the keys is <code>compare-windows</code>.  Note that
<code>compare-windows</code> is preceded by a single-quote; otherwise, Emacs
would first try to evaluate the symbol to determine its value.

   </p>
<p>These three things, the double quotation marks, the backslash before
the `<samp><span class="samp">C</span></samp>', and the single-quote are necessary parts of
keybinding that I tend to forget.  Fortunately, I have come to
remember that I should look at my existing <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file, and
adapt what is there.

   </p>
<p>As for the keybinding itself: <kbd>C-c w</kbd>.  This combines the prefix
key, <kbd>C-c</kbd>, with a single character, in this case, <kbd>w</kbd>.  This
set of keys, <kbd>C-c</kbd> followed by a single character, is strictly
reserved for individuals' own use.  (I call these <dfn>own</dfn> keys, since
these are for my own use.)  You should always be able to create such a
keybinding for your own use without stomping on someone else's
keybinding.  If you ever write an extension to Emacs, please avoid
taking any of these keys for public use.  Create a key like <kbd>C-c
C-w</kbd> instead.  Otherwise, we will run out of own keys.

   </p>
<p>Here is another keybinding, with a comment:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ;;; Keybinding for 'occur'
     ; I use occur a lot, so let's bind it to a key:
     (global-set-key "\C-co" 'occur)
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-occur-329"></a>The <code>occur</code> command shows all the lines in the current buffer
that contain a match for a regular expression.  Matching lines are
shown in a buffer called <samp><span class="file">*Occur*</span></samp>.  That buffer serves as a menu
to jump to occurrences.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-global_002dunset_002dkey-330"></a><a name="index-Unbinding-key-331"></a><a name="index-Key-unbinding-332"></a>Here is how to unbind a key, so it does not
work:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ;;; Unbind 'C-x f'
     (global-unset-key "\C-xf")
</pre>
   <p>There is a reason for this unbinding: I found I inadvertently typed
<kbd>C-x f</kbd><!-- /@w --> when I meant to type <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>.  Rather than find a
file, as I intended, I accidentally set the width for filled text,
almost always to a width I did not want.  Since I hardly ever reset my
default width, I simply unbound the key.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-list_002dbuffers_002c-_0040r_007brebound_007d-333"></a><a name="index-buffer_002dmenu_002c-_0040r_007bbound-to-key_007d-334"></a>The following rebinds an existing key:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ;;; Rebind 'C-x C-b' for 'buffer-menu'
     (global-set-key "\C-x\C-b" 'buffer-menu)
</pre>
   <p>By default, <kbd>C-x C-b</kbd> runs the
<code>list-buffers</code> command.  This command lists
your buffers in <em>another</em> window.  Since I
almost always want to do something in that
window, I prefer the  <code>buffer-menu</code>
command, which not only lists the buffers,
but moves point into that window.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Keymaps"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">16.8 Keymaps</h3>

<p><a name="index-Keymaps-335"></a><a name="index-Rebinding-keys-336"></a>
Emacs uses <dfn>keymaps</dfn> to record which keys call which commands. 
When you use <code>global-set-key</code> to set the keybinding for a single
command in all parts of Emacs, you are specifying the keybinding in
<code>current-global-map</code>.

   </p>
<p>Specific modes, such as C mode or Text mode, have their own keymaps;
the mode-specific keymaps override the global map that is shared by
all buffers.

   </p>
<p>The <code>global-set-key</code> function binds, or rebinds, the global
keymap.  For example, the following binds the key <kbd>C-x C-b</kbd> to the
function <code>buffer-menu</code>:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (global-set-key "\C-x\C-b" 'buffer-menu)
</pre>
   <p>Mode-specific keymaps are bound using the <code>define-key</code> function,
which takes a specific keymap as an argument, as well as the key and
the command.  For example, my <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file contains the
following expression to bind the <code>texinfo-insert-@group</code> command
to <kbd>C-c C-c g</kbd>:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (define-key texinfo-mode-map "\C-c\C-cg" 'texinfo-insert-@group)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The <code>texinfo-insert-@group</code> function itself is a little extension
to Texinfo mode that inserts `<samp><span class="samp">@group</span></samp>' into a Texinfo file.  I
use this command all the time and prefer to type the three strokes
<kbd>C-c C-c g</kbd> rather than the six strokes <kbd>@ g r o u p</kbd>. 
(`<samp><span class="samp">@group</span></samp>' and its matching `<samp><span class="samp">@end group</span></samp>' are commands that
keep all enclosed text together on one page; many multi-line examples
in this book are surrounded by `<samp><span class="samp">@group ... @end group</span></samp>'.)

   </p>
<p>Here is the <code>texinfo-insert-@group</code> function definition:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun texinfo-insert-@group ()
       "Insert the string @group in a Texinfo buffer."
       (interactive)
       (beginning-of-line)
       (insert "@group\n"))
</pre>
   <p>(Of course, I could have used Abbrev mode to save typing, rather than
write a function to insert a word; but I prefer key strokes consistent
with other Texinfo mode key bindings.)

   </p>
<p>You will see numerous <code>define-key</code> expressions in
<samp><span class="file">loaddefs.el</span></samp> as well as in the various mode libraries, such as
<samp><span class="file">cc-mode.el</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">lisp-mode.el</span></samp>.

<div class="node"><a name="Loading-Files"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">16.9 Loading Files</h3>

<p><a name="index-Loading-files-337"></a><!-- findex load -->

   </p>
<p>Many people in the GNU Emacs community have written extensions to
Emacs.  As time goes by, these extensions are often included in new
releases.  For example, the Calendar and Diary packages are now part
of the standard GNU Emacs, as is Calc.

   </p>
<p>You can use a <code>load</code> command to evaluate a complete file and
thereby install all the functions and variables in the file into Emacs. 
For example:

<!-- (auto-compression-mode t) -->
</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (load "~/emacs/slowsplit")
</pre>
   <p>This evaluates, i.e., loads, the <samp><span class="file">slowsplit.el</span></samp> file or if it
exists, the faster, byte compiled <samp><span class="file">slowsplit.elc</span></samp> file from the
<samp><span class="file">emacs</span></samp> sub-directory of your home directory.  The file contains
the function <code>split-window-quietly</code>, which John Robinson wrote in
1989.

   </p>
<p>The <code>split-window-quietly</code> function splits a window with the
minimum of redisplay.  I installed it in 1989 because it worked well
with the slow 1200 baud terminals I was then using.  Nowadays, I only
occasionally come across such a slow connection, but I continue to use
the function because I like the way it leaves the bottom half of a
buffer in the lower of the new windows and the top half in the upper
window.

   </p>
<p>To replace the key binding for the default
<code>split-window-vertically</code>, you must also unset that key and bind
the keys to <code>split-window-quietly</code>, like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (global-unset-key "\C-x2")
     (global-set-key "\C-x2" 'split-window-quietly)
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-load_002dpath-338"></a>If you load many extensions, as I do, then instead of specifying the
exact location of the extension file, as shown above, you can specify
that directory as part of Emacs's <code>load-path</code>.  Then, when Emacs
loads a file, it will search that directory as well as its default
list of directories.  (The default list is specified in <samp><span class="file">paths.h</span></samp>
when Emacs is built.)

   </p>
<p>The following command adds your <samp><span class="file">~/emacs</span></samp> directory to the
existing load path:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ;;; Emacs Load Path
     (setq load-path (cons "~/emacs" load-path))
</pre>
   <p>Incidentally, <code>load-library</code> is an interactive interface to the
<code>load</code> function.  The complete function looks like this:

   </p>
<p><a name="index-load_002dlibrary-339"></a>
</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun load-library (library)
       "Load the Emacs Lisp library named LIBRARY.
     This is an interface to the function `load'.  LIBRARY is searched
     for in `load-path', both with and without `load-suffixes' (as
     well as `load-file-rep-suffixes').
     
     See Info node `(emacs)Lisp Libraries' for more details.
     See `load-file' for a different interface to `load'."
       (interactive
        (list (completing-read "Load library: "
                               (apply-partially 'locate-file-completion-table
                                                load-path
                                                (get-load-suffixes)))))
       (load library))
</pre>
   <p>The name of the function, <code>load-library</code>, comes from the use of
“library” as a conventional synonym for “file”.  The source for the
<code>load-library</code> command is in the <samp><span class="file">files.el</span></samp> library.

   </p>
<p>Another interactive command that does a slightly different job is
<code>load-file</code>.  See <a href="emacs.html#Lisp-Libraries">Libraries of Lisp Code for Emacs</a>, for information on the
distinction between <code>load-library</code> and this command.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Autoload"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">16.10 Autoloading</h3>

<p><a name="index-autoload-340"></a>
Instead of installing a function by loading the file that contains it,
or by evaluating the function definition, you can make the function
available but not actually install it until it is first called.  This
is called <dfn>autoloading</dfn>.

   </p>
<p>When you execute an autoloaded function, Emacs automatically evaluates
the file that contains the definition, and then calls the function.

   </p>
<p>Emacs starts quicker with autoloaded functions, since their libraries
are not loaded right away; but you need to wait a moment when you
first use such a function, while its containing file is evaluated.

   </p>
<p>Rarely used functions are frequently autoloaded.  The
<samp><span class="file">loaddefs.el</span></samp> library contains thousands of autoloaded functions,
from <code>5x5</code> to <code>zone</code>.  Of course, you may
come to use a rare function frequently.  When you do, you should
load that function's file with a <code>load</code> expression in your
<samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file.

   </p>
<p>In my <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file, I load 14 libraries that contain functions
that would otherwise be autoloaded.  (Actually, it would have been
better to include these files in my dumped Emacs, but I forgot. 
See <a href="elisp.html#Building-Emacs">Building Emacs</a>, and the <samp><span class="file">INSTALL</span></samp> file for more about
dumping.)

   </p>
<p>You may also want to include autoloaded expressions in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>
file.  <code>autoload</code> is a built-in function that takes up to five
arguments, the final three of which are optional.  The first argument
is the name of the function to be autoloaded; the second is the name
of the file to be loaded.  The third argument is documentation for the
function, and the fourth tells whether the function can be called
interactively.  The fifth argument tells what type of
object—<code>autoload</code> can handle a keymap or macro as well as a
function (the default is a function).

   </p>
<p>Here is a typical example:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (autoload 'html-helper-mode
       "html-helper-mode" "Edit HTML documents" t)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(<code>html-helper-mode</code> is an older alternative to <code>html-mode</code>,
which is a standard part of the distribution.)

</p>
<p class="noindent">This expression autoloads the <code>html-helper-mode</code> function.  It
takes it from the <samp><span class="file">html-helper-mode.el</span></samp> file (or from the byte
compiled version <samp><span class="file">html-helper-mode.elc</span></samp>, if that exists.)  The
file must be located in a directory specified by <code>load-path</code>. 
The documentation says that this is a mode to help you edit documents
written in the HyperText Markup Language.  You can call this mode
interactively by typing <kbd>M-x html-helper-mode</kbd>.  (You need to
duplicate the function's regular documentation in the autoload
expression because the regular function is not yet loaded, so its
documentation is not available.)

   </p>
<p>See <a href="elisp.html#Autoload">Autoload</a>, for more information.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Simple-Extension"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">16.11 A Simple Extension: <code>line-to-top-of-window</code>

Here is a simple extension to Emacs that moves the line point is on to
the top of the window.  I use this all the time, to make text easier
to read.

   </p>
<p>You can put the following code into a separate file and then load it
from your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file, or you can include it within your
<samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file.

   </p>
<p>Here is the definition:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ;;; Line to top of window;
     ;;; replace three keystroke sequence  C-u 0 C-l
     (defun line-to-top-of-window ()
       "Move the line point is on to top of window."
       (interactive)
       (recenter 0))
</pre>
   <p>Now for the keybinding.

   </p>
<p>Nowadays, function keys as well as mouse button events and
non-<span class="sc">ascii</span> characters are written within square brackets, without
quotation marks.  (In Emacs version 18 and before, you had to write
different function key bindings for each different make of terminal.)

   </p>
<p>I bind <code>line-to-top-of-window</code> to my &lt;F6&gt; function key like
this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (global-set-key [f6] 'line-to-top-of-window)
</pre>
   <p>For more information, see <a href="emacs.html#Init-Rebinding">Rebinding Keys in Your Init File</a>.

use one <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file, you can select which code to evaluate with
the following conditional:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (cond
      ((= 22 emacs-major-version)
       ;; evaluate version 22 code
       ( ... ))
      ((= 23 emacs-major-version)
       ;; evaluate version 23 code

   <p>For example, recent versions blink

   <div class="node"><a name="X11-Colors"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">16.12 X11 Colors</h3>

<p>You can specify colors when you use Emacs with the MIT X Windowing
system.

   </p>
<p>I dislike the default colors and specify my own.

   </p>
<p>Here are the expressions in my <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>
file that set values:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ;; Set cursor color
     (set-cursor-color "white")
     
     ;; Set mouse color
     (set-mouse-color "white")

     (set-foreground-color "white")
     (set-background-color "darkblue")
     
     ;;; Set highlighting colors for isearch and drag

     (set-face-background 'highlight "blue")

             (set-face-background 'holiday-face "slate blue")
             (set-face-foreground 'holiday-face "white")))
</pre>
   <p>The various shades of blue soothe my eye and prevent me from seeing
the screen flicker.

   </p>
<p>Alternatively, I could have set my specifications in various X
initialization files.  For example, I could set the foreground,
background, cursor, and pointer (i.e., mouse) colors in my
<samp><span class="file">~/.Xresources</span></samp> file like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     Emacs*foreground:   white
     Emacs*background:   darkblue
     Emacs*cursorColor:  white
     Emacs*pointerColor: white
</pre>
   <p>In any event, since it is not part of Emacs, I set the root color of
my X window in my <samp><span class="file">~/.xinitrc</span></samp> file, like this<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-16" name="fnd-16"><sup>16</sup></a>:

<p>Here are a few miscellaneous settings:
   </p>
<pre class="sp">

</pre>
     <ul>
<li>Set the shape and color of the mouse cursor:

     <pre class="smallexample">          ; Cursor shapes are defined in
          ; '/usr/include/X11/cursorfont.h';
          ; for example, the 'target' cursor is number 128;
          ; the 'top_left_arrow' cursor is number 132.
          
          (let ((mpointer (x-get-resource "*mpointer"
                                          "*emacs*mpointer")))
            ;; If you have not set your mouse pointer
            ;;     then set it, otherwise leave as is:

<h5 class="subsubheading">Fixing Unpleasant Key Bindings</h5>

<p><a name="index-Key-bindings_002c-fixing-346"></a><a name="index-Bindings_002c-key_002c-fixing-unpleasant-347"></a>
Some systems bind keys unpleasantly.  Sometimes, for example, the
&lt;CTRL&gt; key appears in an awkward spot rather than at the far left
of the home row.

   </p>
<p>Usually, when people fix these sorts of keybindings, they do not
change their <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> file.  Instead, they bind the proper keys
on their consoles with the <code>loadkeys</code> or <code>install-keymap</code>
commands in their boot script and then include <code>xmodmap</code> commands
in their <samp><span class="file">.xinitrc</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">.Xsession</span></samp> file for X Windows.

</p>
<p class="noindent">For a boot script:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     loadkeys /usr/share/keymaps/i386/qwerty/emacs2.kmap.gz
<br>or<br>
     install-keymap emacs2
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">For a <samp><span class="file">.xinitrc</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">.Xsession</span></samp> file when the &lt;Caps
Lock&gt; key is at the far left of the home row:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     # Bind the key labeled 'Caps Lock' to 'Control'
     # (Such a broken user interface suggests that keyboard manufacturers
     # think that computers are typewriters from 1885.)

     xmodmap -e "add Control = Caps_Lock"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In a <samp><span class="file">.xinitrc</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">.Xsession</span></samp> file, to convert an &lt;ALT&gt;

<h3 class="section">16.14 A Modified Mode Line</h3>

<p><a name="index-mode_002dline_002dformat-348"></a><a name="index-Mode-line-format-349"></a>
Finally, a feature I really like: a modified mode line.

   </p>
<p>When I work over a network, I forget which machine I am using.  Also,
I tend to I lose track of where I am, and which line point is on.

   </p>
<p>So I reset my mode line to look like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     -:-- foo.texi   rattlesnake:/home/bob/  Line 1  (Texinfo Fill) Top
</pre>
   <p>I am visiting a file called <samp><span class="file">foo.texi</span></samp>, on my machine
<samp><span class="file">rattlesnake</span></samp> in my <samp><span class="file">/home/bob</span></samp> buffer.  I am on line 1, in
Texinfo mode, and am at the top of the buffer.

   </p>
<p>My <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file has a section that looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ;; Set a Mode Line that tells me which machine, which directory,
     ;; and which line I am on, plus the other customary information.
     (setq-default mode-line-format
      (quote
       (#("-" 0 1
          (help-echo
           "mouse-1: select window, mouse-2: delete others ..."))
        mode-line-mule-info
        mode-line-modified
        mode-line-frame-identification
        "    "
        mode-line-buffer-identification
        "    "
        (:eval (substring
                (system-name) 0 (string-match "\\..+" (system-name))))
        ":"
        default-directory
        #(" " 0 1
          (help-echo
           "mouse-1: select window, mouse-2: delete others ..."))
        (line-number-mode " Line %l ")
        global-mode-string
        #("   %[(" 0 6
          (help-echo
           "mouse-1: select window, mouse-2: delete others ..."))
        (:eval (mode-line-mode-name))
        mode-line-process
        minor-mode-alist
        #("%n" 0 2 (help-echo "mouse-2: widen" local-map (keymap ...)))
        ")%] "
        (-3 . "%P")
        ;;   "-%-"
        )))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here, I redefine the default mode line.  Most of the parts are from
the original; but I make a few changes.  I set the <em>default</em> mode
line format so as to permit various modes, such as Info, to override
it.

   </p>
<p>Many elements in the list are self-explanatory:
<code>mode-line-modified</code> is a variable that tells whether the buffer
has been modified, <code>mode-name</code> tells the name of the mode, and so
on.  However, the format looks complicated because of two features we
have not discussed.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-Properties_002c-in-mode-line-example-350"></a>The first string in the mode line is a dash or hyphen, `<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>'.  In
the old days, it would have been specified simply as <code>"-"</code>.  But
nowadays, Emacs can add properties to a string, such as highlighting
or, as in this case, a help feature.  If you place your mouse cursor
over the hyphen, some help information appears (By default, you must
wait seven-tenths of a second before the information appears.  You can
change that timing by changing the value of <code>tooltip-delay</code>.)

   </p>
<p>The new string format has a special syntax:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     #("-" 0 1 (help-echo "mouse-1: select window, ..."))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The <code>#(</code> begins a list.  The first element of the list is the
string itself, just one `<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>'.  The second and third
elements specify the range over which the fourth element applies.  A
range starts <em>after</em> a character, so a zero means the range
starts just before the first character; a 1 means that the range ends
just after the first character.  The third element is the property for
the range.  It consists of a property list,  a
property name, in this case, `<samp><span class="samp">help-echo</span></samp>', followed by a value, in this
case, a string.  The second, third, and fourth elements of this new
string format can be repeated.

   </p>
<p>See <a href="elisp.html#Text-Properties">Text Properties</a>, and see <a href="elisp.html#Mode-Line-Format">Mode Line Format</a>, for more information.

   </p>
<p><code>mode-line-buffer-identification</code>
displays the current buffer name.  It is a list
beginning <code>(#("%12b" 0 4 ...</code>. 
The <code>#(</code> begins the list.

   </p>
<p>The `<samp><span class="samp">"%12b"</span></samp>' displays the current buffer name, using the
<code>buffer-name</code> function with which we are familiar; the `<samp><span class="samp">12</span></samp>'
specifies the maximum number of characters that will be displayed. 
When a name has fewer characters, whitespace is added to fill out to
this number.  (Buffer names can and often should be longer than 12
characters; this length works well in a typical 80 column wide
window.)

   </p>
<p><code>:eval</code> says to evaluate the following form and use the result as
a string to display.  In this case, the expression displays the first
component of the full system name.  The end of the first component is
a `<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>' (period), so I use the <code>string-match</code> function to
tell me the length of the first component.  The substring from the
zeroth character to that length is the name of the machine.

   </p>
<p>This is the expression:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (:eval (substring
             (system-name) 0 (string-match "\\..+" (system-name))))
</pre>
   <p>`<samp><span class="samp">%[</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">%]</span></samp>' cause a pair of square brackets
to appear for each recursive editing level.  `<samp><span class="samp">%n</span></samp>' says “Narrow”
when narrowing is in effect.  `<samp><span class="samp">%P</span></samp>' tells you the percentage of
the buffer that is above the bottom of the window, or “Top”, “Bottom”,
or “All”.  (A lower case `<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>' tell you the percentage above the
<em>top</em> of the window.)  `<samp><span class="samp">%-</span></samp>' inserts enough dashes to fill
out the line.

   </p>
<p>Remember, you don't have to like Emacs to like it—your own
Emacs can have different colors, different commands, and different
keys than a default Emacs.

   </p>
<p>On the other hand, if you want to bring up a plain out-of-the-box
Emacs, with no customization, type:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     emacs -q
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This will start an Emacs that does <em>not</em> load your
<samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> initialization file.  A plain, default Emacs.  Nothing
more.

<h2 class="chapter">17 Debugging</h2>

<p><a name="index-debugging-351"></a>
GNU Emacs has two debuggers, <code>debug</code> and <code>edebug</code>.  The
first is built into the internals of Emacs and is always with you;
the second requires that you instrument a function before you can use it.

   </p>
<p>Both debuggers are described extensively in <a href="elisp.html#Debugging">Debugging Lisp Programs</a>. 
In this chapter, I will walk through a short example of each.

<div class="node"><a name="debug"></a></div>

<h3 class="section">17.1 <code>debug</code>
</h3>

<p><a name="index-debug-352"></a>
Suppose you have written a function definition that is intended to
return the sum of the numbers 1 through a given number.  (This is the
<code>triangle</code> function discussed earlier.  See <a href="#Decrementing-Example">Example with Decrementing Counter</a>, for a discussion.) 
<!-- xref{Decrementing Loop,, Loop with a Decrementing Counter}, for a discussion.) -->

   </p>
<p>However, your function definition has a bug.  You have mistyped
`<samp><span class="samp">1=</span></samp>' for `<samp><span class="samp">1-</span></samp>'.  Here is the broken definition:

   </p>
<p><a name="index-triangle_002dbugged-353"></a>
</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun triangle-bugged (number)
       "Return sum of numbers 1 through NUMBER inclusive."
       (let ((total 0))
         (while (&gt; number 0)
           (setq total (+ total number))
           (setq number (1= number)))      ; <span class="roman">Error here.</span>
         total))
</pre>
   <p>If you are reading this in Info, you can evaluate this definition in
the normal fashion.  You will see <code>triangle-bugged</code> appear in the
echo area.

   </p>
<p>Now evaluate the <code>triangle-bugged</code> function with an
argument of 4:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (triangle-bugged 4)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In a recent GNU Emacs, you will create and enter a <samp><span class="file">*Backtrace*</span></samp>
buffer that says:

</p>
<p class="noindent">
</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ---------- Buffer: *Backtrace* ----------
     Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-function 1=)
       (1= number)
       (setq number (1= number))
       (while (&gt; number 0) (setq total (+ total number))
             (setq number (1= number)))
       (let ((total 0)) (while (&gt; number 0) (setq total ...)
         (setq number ...)) total)
       triangle-bugged(4)
       eval((triangle-bugged 4))
       eval-last-sexp-1(nil)
       eval-last-sexp(nil)
       call-interactively(eval-last-sexp)
     ---------- Buffer: *Backtrace* ----------
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(I have reformatted this example slightly; the debugger does not fold
long lines.  As usual, you can quit the debugger by typing <kbd>q</kbd> in
the <samp><span class="file">*Backtrace*</span></samp> buffer.)

   </p>
<p>In practice, for a bug as simple as this, the Lisp error line will
tell you what you need to know to correct the definition.  The
function <code>1=</code> is void.

   </p>
<p>However, suppose you are not quite certain what is going on? 
You can read the complete backtrace.

   </p>
<p>In this case, you need to run a recent GNU Emacs, which automatically
starts the debugger that puts you in the <samp><span class="file">*Backtrace*</span></samp> buffer; or
else, you need to start the debugger manually as described below.

   </p>
<p>Read the <samp><span class="file">*Backtrace*</span></samp> buffer from the bottom up; it tells you
what Emacs did that led to the error.  Emacs made an interactive call
to <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd> (<code>eval-last-sexp</code>), which led to the evaluation
of the <code>triangle-bugged</code> expression.  Each line above tells you
what the Lisp interpreter evaluated next.

   </p>
<p>The third line from the top of the buffer is

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setq number (1= number))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Emacs tried to evaluate this expression; in order to do so, it tried
to evaluate the inner expression shown on the second line from the
top:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (1= number)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This is where the error occurred; as the top line says:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-function 1=)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You can correct the mistake, re-evaluate the function definition, and
then run your test again.

<h3 class="section">17.2 <code>debug-on-entry</code>
</h3>

<p><a name="index-debug_002don_002dentry-354"></a>
A recent GNU Emacs starts the debugger automatically when your
function has an error.

   </p>
<p>Incidentally, you can start the debugger manually for all versions of
Emacs; the advantage is that the debugger runs even if you do not have
a bug in your code.  Sometimes your code will be free of bugs!

   </p>
<p>You can enter the debugger when you call the function by calling
<code>debug-on-entry</code>.

</p>
<p class="noindent">Type:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     M-x debug-on-entry RET triangle-bugged RET
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Now, evaluate the following:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (triangle-bugged 5)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">All versions of Emacs will create a <samp><span class="file">*Backtrace*</span></samp> buffer and tell
you that it is beginning to evaluate the <code>triangle-bugged</code>
function:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ---------- Buffer: *Backtrace* ----------
     Debugger entered--entering a function:
     * triangle-bugged(5)
       eval((triangle-bugged 5))
       eval-last-sexp-1(nil)
       eval-last-sexp(nil)
       call-interactively(eval-last-sexp)
     ---------- Buffer: *Backtrace* ----------
</pre>
   <p>In the <samp><span class="file">*Backtrace*</span></samp> buffer, type <kbd>d</kbd>.  Emacs will evaluate
the first expression in <code>triangle-bugged</code>; the buffer will look
like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ---------- Buffer: *Backtrace* ----------
     Debugger entered--beginning evaluation of function call form:
     * (let ((total 0)) (while (&gt; number 0) (setq total ...)
             (setq number ...)) total)
     * triangle-bugged(5)
       eval((triangle-bugged 5))
       eval-last-sexp-1(nil)
       eval-last-sexp(nil)
       call-interactively(eval-last-sexp)
     ---------- Buffer: *Backtrace* ----------
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Now, type <kbd>d</kbd> again, eight times, slowly.  Each time you type
<kbd>d</kbd>, Emacs will evaluate another expression in the function
definition.

   </p>
<p>Eventually, the buffer will look like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ---------- Buffer: *Backtrace* ----------
     Debugger entered--beginning evaluation of function call form:
     * (setq number (1= number))
     * (while (&gt; number 0) (setq total (+ total number))

       call-interactively(eval-last-sexp)
     ---------- Buffer: *Backtrace* ----------
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Finally, after you type <kbd>d</kbd> two more times, Emacs will reach the
error, and the top two lines of the <samp><span class="file">*Backtrace*</span></samp> buffer will look

<h3 class="section">17.4 The <code>edebug</code> Source Level Debugger</h3>

<p><a name="index-Source-level-debugger-358"></a><a name="index-edebug-359"></a>
Edebug is a source level debugger.  Edebug normally displays the
source of the code you are debugging, with an arrow at the left that
shows which line you are currently executing.

   </p>
<p>You can walk through the execution of a function, line by line, or run
quickly until reaching a <dfn>breakpoint</dfn> where execution stops.

   </p>
<p>Edebug is described in <a href="elisp.html#Edebug">Edebug</a>.

   </p>
<p>Here is a bugged function definition for <code>triangle-recursively</code>. 
See <a href="#Recursive-triangle-function">Recursion in place of a counter</a>,
for a review of it.

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun triangle-recursively-bugged (number)
       "Return sum of numbers 1 through NUMBER inclusive.
     Uses recursion."
       (if (= number 1)
           1
         (+ number
            (triangle-recursively-bugged
             (1= number)))))               ; <span class="roman">Error here.</span>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Normally, you would install this definition by positioning your cursor
after the function's closing parenthesis and typing <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>
(<code>eval-last-sexp</code>) or else by positioning your cursor within the
definition and typing <kbd>C-M-x</kbd> (<code>eval-defun</code>).  (By default,
the <code>eval-defun</code> command works only in Emacs Lisp mode or in Lisp
Interaction mode.)

   </p>
<p>However, to prepare this function definition for Edebug, you must
first <dfn>instrument</dfn> the code using a different command.  You can do
this by positioning your cursor within or just after the definition
and typing

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     M-x edebug-defun RET
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This will cause Emacs to load Edebug automatically if it is not
already loaded, and properly instrument the function.

   </p>
<p>After instrumenting the function, place your cursor after the
following expression and type <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd> (<code>eval-last-sexp</code>):

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (triangle-recursively-bugged 3)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You will be jumped back to the source for
<code>triangle-recursively-bugged</code> and the cursor positioned at the
beginning of the <code>if</code> line of the function.  Also, you will see
an arrowhead at the left hand side of that line.  The arrowhead marks
the line where the function is executing.  (In the following examples,
we show the arrowhead with `<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>'; in a windowing system, you may
see the arrowhead as a solid triangle in the window fringe.)

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     =&gt;-!-(if (= number 1)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In the example, the location of point is displayed as `<samp><span class="samp">-!-</span></samp>'
(in a printed book, it is displayed with a five pointed star).

   </p>
<p>If you now press &lt;SPC&gt;, point will move to the next expression to
be executed; the line will look like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     =&gt;(if -!-(= number 1)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">As you continue to press &lt;SPC&gt;, point will move from expression to
expression.  At the same time, whenever an expression returns a value,
that value will be displayed in the echo area.  For example, after you
move point past <code>number</code>, you will see the following:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     Result: 3 (#o3, #x3, ?\C-c)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This means the value of <code>number</code> is 3, which is octal three,
hexadecimal three, and <span class="sc">ascii</span> Control-C (the third letter of the
alphabet, in case you need to know this information).

   </p>
<p>You can continue moving through the code until you reach the line with
the error.  Before evaluation, that line looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     =&gt;        -!-(1= number)))))               ; <span class="roman">Error here.</span>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">When you press &lt;SPC&gt; once again, you will produce an error message
that says:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     Symbol's function definition is void: 1=
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This is the bug.

   </p>
<p>Press <kbd>q</kbd> to quit Edebug.

   </p>
<p>To remove instrumentation from a function definition, simply
re-evaluate it with a command that does not instrument it. 
For example, you could place your cursor after the definition's
closing parenthesis and type <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>.

   </p>
<p>Edebug does a great deal more than walk with you through a function. 
You can set it so it races through on its own, stopping only at an
error or at specified stopping points; you can cause it to display the
changing values of various expressions; you can find out how many
times a function is called, and more.

     <ul>
<li>Install the <code>count-words-example</code> function and then cause it to
enter the built-in debugger when you call it.  Run the command on a
region containing two words.  You will need to press <kbd>d</kbd> a
remarkable number of times.  On your system, is a hook called after
the command finishes?  (For information on hooks, see <a href="elisp.html#Command-Overview">Command Loop Overview</a>.)

     </li>
<li>Copy <code>count-words-example</code> into the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer,
instrument the function for Edebug, and walk through its execution. 
The function does not need to have a bug, although you can introduce
one if you wish.  If the function lacks a bug, the walk-through
completes without problems.

     </li>
<li>While running Edebug, type <kbd>?</kbd> to see a list of all the Edebug commands. 
(The <code>global-edebug-prefix</code> is usually <kbd>C-x X</kbd>, i.e.,
<kbd>&lt;CTRL&gt;-x</kbd> followed by an upper case <kbd>X</kbd>; use this prefix
for commands made outside of the Edebug debugging buffer.)

     </li>
<li>In the Edebug debugging buffer, use the <kbd>p</kbd>
(<code>edebug-bounce-point</code>) command to see where in the region the
<code>count-words-example</code> is working.

     </li>
<li>Move point to some spot further down the function and then type the
<kbd>h</kbd> (<code>edebug-goto-here</code>) command to jump to that location.

     </li>
<li>Use the <kbd>t</kbd> (<code>edebug-trace-mode</code>) command to cause Edebug to
walk through the function on its own; use an upper case <kbd>T</kbd> for
<code>edebug-Trace-fast-mode</code>.

<div class="node"><a name="Conclusion"></a></div>

<h2 class="chapter">18 Conclusion</h2>

<p>We have now reached the end of this Introduction.  You have now
learned enough about programming in Emacs Lisp to set values, to write
simple <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> files for yourself and your friends, and write
simple customizations and extensions to Emacs.

   </p>
<p>This is a place to stop.  Or, if you wish, you can now go onward, and
teach yourself.

   </p>
<p>You have learned some of the basic nuts and bolts of programming.  But
only some.  There are a great many more brackets and hinges that are
easy to use that we have not touched.

   </p>
<p>A path you can follow right now lies among the sources to GNU Emacs
and in
<cite>The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</cite>.

   </p>
<p>The Emacs Lisp sources are an adventure.  When you read the sources and
come across a function or expression that is unfamiliar, you need to
figure out or find out what it does.

   </p>
<p>Go to the Reference Manual.  It is a thorough, complete, and fairly
easy-to-read description of Emacs Lisp.  It is written not only for
experts, but for people who know what you know.  (The <cite>Reference
Manual</cite> comes with the standard GNU Emacs distribution.  Like this
introduction, it comes as a Texinfo source file, so you can read it
on your computer and as a typeset, printed book.)

   </p>
<p>Go to the other built-in help that is part of GNU Emacs: the built-in
documentation for all functions and variables, and <code>find-tag</code>,
the program that takes you to sources.

   </p>
<p>Here is an example of how I explore the sources.  Because of its name,
<samp><span class="file">simple.el</span></samp> is the file I looked at first, a long time ago.  As
it happens some of the functions in <samp><span class="file">simple.el</span></samp> are complicated,
or at least look complicated at first sight.  The <code>open-line</code>
function, for example, looks complicated.

   </p>
<p>You may want to walk through this function slowly, as we did with the
<code>forward-sentence</code> function.  (See <a href="#forward_002dsentence">The <code>forward-sentence</code> function</a>.)  Or you may want to skip that
function and look at another, such as <code>split-line</code>.  You don't
need to read all the functions.  According to
<code>count-words-in-defun</code>, the <code>split-line</code> function contains
102 words and symbols.

   </p>
<p>Even though it is short, <code>split-line</code> contains  expressions
we have not studied: <code>skip-chars-forward</code>, <code>indent-to</code>,
<code>current-column</code> and <code>insert-and-inherit</code>.

   </p>
<p>Consider the <code>skip-chars-forward</code> function. 
In GNU Emacs, you can find out more about <code>skip-chars-forward</code> by
typing <kbd>C-h f</kbd> (<code>describe-function</code>) and the name of the
function.  This gives you the function documentation.

   </p>
<p>You may be able to guess what is done by a well named function such as
<code>indent-to</code>; or you can look it up, too.  Incidentally, the
<code>describe-function</code> function itself is in <samp><span class="file">help.el</span></samp>; it is
one of those long, but decipherable functions.  You can look up
<code>describe-function</code> using the <kbd>C-h f</kbd> command!

   </p>
<p>In this instance, since the code is Lisp, the <samp><span class="file">*Help*</span></samp> buffer
contains the name of the library containing the function's source. 
You can put point over the name of the library and press the RET key,
which in this situation is bound to <code>help-follow</code>, and be taken
directly to the source, in the same way as <kbd>M-.</kbd>
(<code>find-tag</code>).

   </p>
<p>The definition for <code>describe-function</code> illustrates how to
customize the <code>interactive</code> expression without using the standard
character codes; and it shows how to create a temporary buffer.

   </p>
<p>(The <code>indent-to</code> function is written in C rather than Emacs Lisp;
it is a built-in function.  <code>help-follow</code> takes you to its
source as does <code>find-tag</code>, when properly set up.)

   </p>
<p>You can look at a function's source using <code>find-tag</code>, which is
bound to <kbd>M-.</kbd>  Finally, you can find out what the Reference
Manual has to say by visiting the manual in Info, and typing <kbd>i</kbd>
(<code>Info-index</code>) and the name of the function, or by looking up the
function in the index to a printed copy of the manual.

   </p>
<p>Similarly, you can find out what is meant by
<code>insert-and-inherit</code>.

   </p>
<p>Other interesting source files include <samp><span class="file">paragraphs.el</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="file">loaddefs.el</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="file">loadup.el</span></samp>.  The <samp><span class="file">paragraphs.el</span></samp>
file includes short, easily understood functions as well as longer
ones.  The <samp><span class="file">loaddefs.el</span></samp> file contains the many standard
autoloads and many keymaps.  I have never looked at it all; only at
parts.  <samp><span class="file">loadup.el</span></samp> is the file that loads the standard parts of
Emacs; it tells you a great deal about how Emacs is built. 
(See <a href="elisp.html#Building-Emacs">Building Emacs</a>, for more about building.)

   </p>
<p>As I said, you have learned some nuts and bolts; however, and very
importantly, we have hardly touched major aspects of programming; I
have said nothing about how to sort information, except to use the
predefined <code>sort</code> function; I have said nothing about how to store
information, except to use variables and lists; I have said nothing
about how to write programs that write programs.  These are topics for
another, and different kind of book, a different kind of learning.

   </p>
<p>What you have done is learn enough for much practical work with GNU
Emacs.  What you have done is get started.  This is the end of a
beginning.

<div class="node">

</div>

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix A The <code>the-the</code> Function</h2>

<p><a name="index-the_002dthe-360"></a><a name="index-Duplicated-words-function-361"></a><a name="index-Words_002c-duplicated-362"></a>
Sometimes when you you write text, you duplicate words—as with “you
you” near the beginning of this sentence.  I find that most
frequently, I duplicate “the”; hence, I call the function for
detecting duplicated words, <code>the-the</code>.

   </p>
<p>As a first step, you could use the following regular expression to
search for duplicates:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     \\(\\w+[ \t\n]+\\)\\1
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This regexp matches one or more word-constituent characters followed
by one or more spaces, tabs, or newlines.  However, it does not detect
duplicated words on different lines, since the ending of the first
word, the end of the line, is different from the ending of the second
word, a space.  (For more information about regular expressions, see
<a href="#Regexp-Search">Regular Expression Searches</a>, as well as
<a href="emacs.html#Regexps">Syntax of Regular Expressions</a>, and <a href="elisp.html#Regular-Expressions">Regular Expressions</a>.)

   </p>
<p>You might try searching just for duplicated word-constituent
characters but that does not work since the pattern detects doubles
such as the two occurrences of “th” in “with the”.

   </p>
<p>Another possible regexp searches for word-constituent characters
followed by non-word-constituent characters, reduplicated.  Here,
`<samp><span class="samp">\\w+</span></samp>'<!-- /@w --> matches one or more word-constituent characters and
`<samp><span class="samp">\\W*</span></samp>'<!-- /@w --> matches zero or more non-word-constituent characters.

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     \\(\\(\\w+\\)\\W*\\)\\1
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Again, not useful.

   </p>
<p>Here is the pattern that I use.  It is not perfect, but good enough. 
`<samp><span class="samp">\\b</span></samp>'<!-- /@w --> matches the empty string, provided it is at the beginning
or end of a word; `<samp><span class="samp">[^@ \n\t]+</span></samp>'<!-- /@w --> matches one or more occurrences of
any characters that are <em>not</em> an @-sign, space, newline, or tab.

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     \\b\\([^@ \n\t]+\\)[ \n\t]+\\1\\b
</pre>
   <p>One can write more complicated expressions, but I found that this
expression is good enough, so I use it.

   </p>
<p>Here is the <code>the-the</code> function, as I include it in my
<samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file, along with a handy global key binding:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun the-the ()
       "Search forward for for a duplicated word."
       (interactive)
       (message "Searching for for duplicated words ...")
       (push-mark)
       ;; This regexp is not perfect
       ;; but is fairly good over all:
       (if (re-search-forward
            "\\b\\([^@ \n\t]+\\)[ \n\t]+\\1\\b" nil 'move)
           (message "Found duplicated word.")
         (message "End of buffer")))
     
     ;; Bind 'the-the' to  C-c \
     (global-set-key "\C-c\\" 'the-the)
</pre>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
Here is test text:

<pre class="smallexample">     one two two three four five
     five six seven
</pre>
   <p>You can substitute the other regular expressions shown above in the
function definition and try each of them on this list.

<code>kill-ring-yank-pointer</code> to the latest element of the kill
ring, which means that all the functions that call it set the value

<code>kill-ring-save</code>, <code>kill-line</code>, and <code>kill-region</code>.

<code>current-kill</code> in Outline</h4>

   <p>The <code>current-kill</code> function looks complex, but as usual, it can
be understood by taking it apart piece by piece.  First look at it in
skeletal form:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun current-kill (n &amp;optional do-not-move)
       "Rotate the yanking point by N places, and then return that kill."
       (let <var>varlist</var>
         <var>body</var>...)
</pre>
   <p>This function takes two arguments, one of which is optional.  It has a
documentation string.  It is <em>not</em> interactive.

</div>

<h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">The Body of <code>current-kill</code>
</h5>

   <p>The body of the function definition is a <code>let</code> expression, which
itself has a body as well as a <var>varlist</var>.

   </p>
<p>The <code>let</code> expression declares a variable that will be only usable
within the bounds of this function.  This variable is called
<code>interprogram-paste</code> and is for copying to another program.  It
is not for copying within this instance of GNU Emacs.  Most window
systems provide a facility for interprogram pasting.  Sadly, that
facility usually provides only for the last element.  Most windowing
systems have not adopted a ring of many possibilities, even though
Emacs has provided it for decades.

   </p>
<p>The <code>if</code> expression has two parts, one if there exists
<code>interprogram-paste</code> and one if not.

   </p>
<p>Let us consider the else-part of the <code>current-kill</code>
function.  (The then-part uses the <code>kill-new</code> function, which
we have already described.  See <a href="#kill_002dnew-function">The <code>kill-new</code> function</a>.)

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (or kill-ring (error "Kill ring is empty"))
     (let ((ARGth-kill-element
            (nthcdr (mod (- n (length kill-ring-yank-pointer))
                         (length kill-ring))
                    kill-ring)))
       (or do-not-move
           (setq kill-ring-yank-pointer ARGth-kill-element))
       (car ARGth-kill-element))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The code first checks whether the kill ring has content; otherwise it
signals an error.

   </p>
<p>Note that the <code>or</code> expression is very similar to testing length
with an <code>if</code>:

   </p>
<p><a name="index-zerop-367"></a><a name="index-error-368"></a>
</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (if (zerop (length kill-ring))          ; <span class="roman">if-part</span>
         (error "Kill ring is empty"))       ; <span class="roman">then-part</span>
       ;; No else-part
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If there is not anything in the kill ring, its length must be zero and
an error message sent to the user: `<samp><span class="samp">Kill ring is empty</span></samp>'.  The
<code>current-kill</code> function uses an <code>or</code> expression which is
simpler.  But an <code>if</code> expression reminds us what goes on.

   </p>
<p>This <code>if</code> expression uses the function <code>zerop</code> which returns
true if the value it is testing is zero.  When <code>zerop</code> tests
true, the then-part of the <code>if</code> is evaluated.  The then-part is a
list starting with the function <code>error</code>, which is a function that
is similar to the <code>message</code> function
(see <a href="#message">The <code>message</code> Function</a>) in that
it prints a one-line message in the echo area.  However, in addition
to printing a message, <code>error</code> also stops evaluation of the
function within which it is embedded.  This means that the rest of the
function will not be evaluated if the length of the kill ring is zero.

   </p>
<p>Then the <code>current-kill</code> function selects the element to return. 
The selection depends on the number of places that <code>current-kill</code>
rotates and on where <code>kill-ring-yank-pointer</code> points.

   </p>
<p>Next, either the optional <code>do-not-move</code> argument is true or the
current value of <code>kill-ring-yank-pointer</code> is set to point to the
list.  Finally, another expression returns the first element of the
list even if the <code>do-not-move</code> argument is true.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Digression-concerning-error"></a></div>

<h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">Digression about the word “error”</h5>

   <p>In my opinion, it is slightly misleading, at least to humans, to use
the term “error” as the name of the <code>error</code> function.  A better
term would be “cancel”.  Strictly speaking, of course, you cannot
point to, much less rotate a pointer to a list that has no length, so
from the point of view of the computer, the word “error” is correct. 
But a human expects to attempt this sort of thing, if only to find out
whether the kill ring is full or empty.  This is an act of
exploration.

   </p>
<p>From the human point of view, the act of exploration and discovery is
not necessarily an error, and therefore should not be labeled as one,
even in the bowels of a computer.  As it is, the code in Emacs implies
that a human who is acting virtuously, by exploring his or her
environment, is making an error.  This is bad.  Even though the computer
takes the same steps as it does when there is an error, a term such as
“cancel” would have a clearer connotation.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Determining-the-Element"></a></div>

<h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">Determining the Element</h5>

   <p>Among other actions, the else-part of the <code>if</code> expression sets
the value of <code>kill-ring-yank-pointer</code> to
<code>ARGth-kill-element</code> when the kill ring has something in it and
the value of <code>do-not-move</code> is <code>nil</code>.

   </p>
<p>The code looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (nthcdr (mod (- n (length kill-ring-yank-pointer))
                  (length kill-ring))
             kill-ring)))
</pre>
   <p>This needs some examination.  Unless it is not supposed to move the
pointer, the <code>current-kill</code> function changes where
<code>kill-ring-yank-pointer</code> points. 
That is what the
<code>(setq kill-ring-yank-pointer ARGth-kill-element))</code><!-- /@w -->
expression does.  Also, clearly, <code>ARGth-kill-element</code> is being
set to be equal to some <span class="sc">cdr</span> of the kill ring, using the
<code>nthcdr</code> function that is described in an earlier section. 
(See <a href="#copy_002dregion_002das_002dkill">copy-region-as-kill</a>.)  How does it do this?

   </p>
<p>As we have seen before (see <a href="#nthcdr">nthcdr</a>), the <code>nthcdr</code> function
works by repeatedly taking the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of a list—it takes the
<span class="sc">cdr</span> of the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of the <span class="sc">cdr</span> <small class="dots">...</small>

   </p>
<p>The two following expressions produce the same result:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setq kill-ring-yank-pointer (cdr kill-ring))
     
     (setq kill-ring-yank-pointer (nthcdr 1 kill-ring))
</pre>
   <p>However, the <code>nthcdr</code> expression is more complicated.  It uses
the <code>mod</code> function to determine which <span class="sc">cdr</span> to select.

   </p>
<p>(You will remember to look at inner functions first; indeed, we will
have to go inside the <code>mod</code>.)

   </p>
<p>The <code>mod</code> function returns the value of its first argument modulo
the second; that is to say, it returns the remainder after dividing
the first argument by the second.  The value returned has the same
sign as the second argument.

   </p>
<p>Thus,

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (mod 12 4)
       =&gt; 0  ;; <span class="roman">because there is no remainder</span>
     (mod 13 4)
       =&gt; 1
</pre>
   <p>In this case, the first argument is often smaller than the second. 
That is fine.

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (mod 0 4)
       =&gt; 0
     (mod 1 4)
       =&gt; 1
</pre>
   <p>We can guess what the <code>-</code> function does.  It is like <code>+</code> but
subtracts instead of adds; the <code>-</code> function subtracts its second
argument from its first.  Also, we already know what the <code>length</code>
function does (see <a href="#length">length</a>).  It returns the length of a list.

   </p>
<p>And <code>n</code> is the name of the required argument to the
<code>current-kill</code> function.

   </p>
<p>So when the first argument to <code>nthcdr</code> is zero, the <code>nthcdr</code>
expression returns the whole list, as you can see by evaluating the
following:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ;; kill-ring-yank-pointer <span class="roman">and</span> kill-ring <span class="roman">have a length of four</span>
     ;; <span class="roman">and</span> (mod (- 0 4) 4) =&gt; 0
     (nthcdr (mod (- 0 4) 4)
             '("fourth line of text"
               "third line"
               "second piece of text"
               "first some text"))
</pre>
   <p>When the first argument to the <code>current-kill</code> function is one,
the <code>nthcdr</code> expression returns the list without its first
element.

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (nthcdr (mod (- 1 4) 4)
             '("fourth line of text"
               "third line"
               "second piece of text"
               "first some text"))
</pre>

are <dfn>global variables</dfn>.  That means that any expression in Emacs

Local variables can only be accessed
within the <code>let</code> that defines them or the function that specifies
them in an argument list (and within expressions called by them).

<h3 class="appendixsec">B.2 <code>yank</code>
</h3>

<p><a name="index-yank-371"></a>
After learning about <code>current-kill</code>, the code for the
<code>yank</code> function is almost easy.

   </p>
<p>The <code>yank</code> function does not use the
<code>kill-ring-yank-pointer</code> variable directly.  It calls
<code>insert-for-yank</code> which calls <code>current-kill</code> which sets the
<code>kill-ring-yank-pointer</code> variable.

   </p>
<p>The code looks like this:

<!-- in GNU Emacs 22 -->
</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun yank (&amp;optional arg)
       "Reinsert (\"paste\") the last stretch of killed text.
     More precisely, reinsert the stretch of killed text most recently
     killed OR yanked.  Put point at end, and set mark at beginning.
     With just \\[universal-argument] as argument, same but put point at beginning (and mark at end).
     With argument N, reinsert the Nth most recently killed stretch of killed
     text.
     
     When this command inserts killed text into the buffer, it honors
     `yank-excluded-properties' and `yank-handler' as described in the
     doc string for `insert-for-yank-1', which see.
     
     See also the command `yank-pop' (\\[yank-pop])."
       (interactive "*P")
       (setq yank-window-start (window-start))
       ;; If we don't get all the way thru, make last-command indicate that
       ;; for the following command.
       (setq this-command t)
       (push-mark (point))
       (insert-for-yank (current-kill (cond
                                       ((listp arg) 0)
                                       ((eq arg '-) -2)
                                       (t (1- arg)))))
       (if (consp arg)
           ;; This is like exchange-point-and-mark, but doesn't activate the mark.
           ;; It is cleaner to avoid activation, even though the command
           ;; loop would deactivate the mark because we inserted text.
           (goto-char (prog1 (mark t)
                        (set-marker (mark-marker) (point) (current-buffer)))))
       ;; If we do get all the way thru, make this-command indicate that.
       (if (eq this-command t)
           (setq this-command 'yank))
       nil)
</pre>
   <p>The key expression is <code>insert-for-yank</code>, which inserts the string
returned by <code>current-kill</code>, but removes some text properties from
it.

   </p>
<p>However, before getting to that expression, the function sets the value
of <code>yank-window-start</code> to the position returned by the
<code>(window-start)</code> expression, the position at which the display
currently starts.  The <code>yank</code> function also sets
<code>this-command</code> and pushes the mark.

   </p>
<p>After it yanks the appropriate element, if the optional argument is a
<span class="sc">cons</span> rather than a number or nothing, it puts point at beginning
of the yanked text and mark at its end.

   </p>
<p>(The <code>prog1</code> function is like <code>progn</code> but returns the value
of its first argument rather than the value of its last argument.  Its
first argument is forced to return the buffer's mark as an integer. 
You can see the documentation for these functions by placing point
over them in this buffer and then typing <kbd>C-h f</kbd>
(<code>describe-function</code>) followed by a <kbd>RET</kbd>; the default is the
function.)

   </p>
<p>The last part of the function tells what to do when it succeeds.

<h3 class="appendixsec">B.3 <code>yank-pop</code>
</h3>

<p><a name="index-yank_002dpop-372"></a>
After understanding <code>yank</code> and <code>current-kill</code>, you know how
to approach the <code>yank-pop</code> function.  Leaving out the
documentation to save space, it looks like this:

<!-- GNU Emacs 22 -->
</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun yank-pop (&amp;optional arg)
       "..."
       (interactive "*p")
       (if (not (eq last-command 'yank))
           (error "Previous command was not a yank"))
       (setq this-command 'yank)
       (unless arg (setq arg 1))
       (let ((inhibit-read-only t)
             (before (&lt; (point) (mark t))))
         (if before
             (funcall (or yank-undo-function 'delete-region) (point) (mark t))
           (funcall (or yank-undo-function 'delete-region) (mark t) (point)))
         (setq yank-undo-function nil)
         (set-marker (mark-marker) (point) (current-buffer))
         (insert-for-yank (current-kill arg))
         ;; Set the window start back where it was in the yank command,
         ;; if possible.
         (set-window-start (selected-window) yank-window-start t)
         (if before
             ;; This is like exchange-point-and-mark,
             ;;     but doesn't activate the mark.
             ;; It is cleaner to avoid activation, even though the command
             ;; loop would deactivate the mark because we inserted text.
             (goto-char (prog1 (mark t)
                          (set-marker (mark-marker)
                                      (point)
                                      (current-buffer))))))
       nil)
</pre>
   <p>The function is interactive with a small `<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>' so the prefix
argument is processed and passed to the function.  The command can
only be used after a previous yank; otherwise an error message is
sent.  This check uses the variable <code>last-command</code> which is set
by <code>yank</code> and is discussed elsewhere. 
(See <a href="#copy_002dregion_002das_002dkill">copy-region-as-kill</a>.)

   </p>
<p>The <code>let</code> clause sets the variable <code>before</code> to true or false
depending whether point is before or after mark and then the region
between point and mark is deleted.  This is the region that was just
inserted by the previous yank and it is this text that will be
replaced.

   </p>
<p><code>funcall</code> calls its first argument as a function, passing
remaining arguments to it.  The first argument is whatever the
<code>or</code> expression returns.  The two remaining arguments are the
positions of point and mark set by the preceding <code>yank</code> command.

   </p>
<p>There is more, but that is the hardest part.

   <p>Indeed, with a little thought, we can easily come up with a variety of
vertical and horizontal labeling schemes.  Our task could become
complicated.  But complications breed confusion.  Rather than permit
this, it is better choose a simple labeling scheme for our first
effort, and to modify or replace it later.

   </p>
<p>These considerations suggest the following outline for the
<code>print-graph</code> function:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun print-graph (numbers-list)
       "<var>documentation</var>..."
       (let ((height  ...
             ...))
         (print-Y-axis height ... )
         (graph-body-print numbers-list)
         (print-X-axis ... )))
</pre>
   <p>We can work on each part of the <code>print-graph</code> function definition
in turn.

<h3 class="appendixsec">C.1 The <code>print-graph</code> Varlist</h3>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bprint_002dgraph_007d-varlist-374"></a>
In writing the <code>print-graph</code> function, the first task is to write
the varlist in the <code>let</code> expression.  (We will leave aside for the
moment any thoughts about making the function interactive or about the
contents of its documentation string.)

   </p>
<p>The varlist should set several values.  Clearly, the top of the label
for the vertical axis must be at least the height of the graph, which
means that we must obtain this information here.  Note that the
<code>print-graph-body</code> function also requires this information.  There
is no reason to calculate the height of the graph in two different
places, so we should change <code>print-graph-body</code> from the way we
defined it earlier to take advantage of the calculation.

   </p>
<p>Similarly, both the function for printing the X axis labels and the
<code>print-graph-body</code> function need to learn the value of the width of
each symbol.  We can perform the calculation here and change the
definition for <code>print-graph-body</code> from the way we defined it in the
previous chapter.

   </p>
<p>The length of the label for the horizontal axis must be at least as long
as the graph.  However, this information is used only in the function
that prints the horizontal axis, so it does not need to be calculated here.

   </p>
<p>These thoughts lead us directly to the following form for the varlist
in the <code>let</code> for <code>print-graph</code>:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (let ((height (apply 'max numbers-list)) ; <span class="roman">First version.</span>
           (symbol-width (length graph-blank)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">As we shall see, this expression is not quite right.

The job of the <code>print-Y-axis</code> function is to print a label for

          1 -
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The function should be passed the height of the graph, and then should
construct and insert the appropriate numbers and marks.

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">The <code>print-Y-axis</code> Function in Detail</h4>

   <p>It is easy enough to see in the figure what the Y axis label should
look like; but to say in words, and then to write a function
definition to do the job is another matter.  It is not quite true to
say that we want a number and a tic every five lines: there are only
three lines between the `<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>' and the `<samp><span class="samp">5</span></samp>' (lines 2, 3, and 4),
but four lines between the `<samp><span class="samp">5</span></samp>' and the `<samp><span class="samp">10</span></samp>' (lines 6, 7, 8,
and 9).  It is better to say that we want a number and a tic mark on
the base line (number 1) and then that we want a number and a tic on
the fifth line from the bottom and on every line that is a multiple of
five.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Height-of-label"></a></div>

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">What height should the label be?</h4>

   <p>The next issue is what height the label should be?  Suppose the maximum
height of tallest column of the graph is seven.  Should the highest
label on the Y axis be `<samp><span class="samp">5 -</span></samp>', and should the graph stick up above
the label?  Or should the highest label be `<samp><span class="samp">7 -</span></samp>', and mark the peak
of the graph?  Or should the highest label be <code>10 -</code>, which is a
multiple of five, and be higher than the topmost value of the graph?

   </p>
<p>The latter form is preferred.  Most graphs are drawn within rectangles
whose sides are an integral number of steps long—5, 10, 15, and so
on for a step distance of five.  But as soon as we decide to use a
step height for the vertical axis, we discover that the simple
expression in the varlist for computing the height is wrong.  The
expression is <code>(apply 'max numbers-list)</code>.  This returns the
precise height, not the maximum height plus whatever is necessary to
round up to the nearest multiple of five.  A more complex expression
is required.

   </p>
<p>As usual in cases like this, a complex problem becomes simpler if it is
divided into several smaller problems.

   </p>
<p>First, consider the case when the highest value of the graph is an
integral multiple of five—when it is 5, 10, 15, or some higher
multiple of five.  We can use this value as the Y axis height.

   </p>
<p>A fairly simply way to determine whether a number is a multiple of
five is to divide it by five and see if the division results in a
remainder.  If there is no remainder, the number is a multiple of
five.  Thus, seven divided by five has a remainder of two, and seven
is not an integral multiple of five.  Put in slightly different
language, more reminiscent of the classroom, five goes into seven
once, with a remainder of two.  However, five goes into ten twice,
with no remainder: ten is an integral multiple of five.

</p>
<div class="node"><a name="Compute-a-Remainder"></a></div>

<h4 class="appendixsubsec">C.2.1 Side Trip: Compute a Remainder</h4>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0025-_0040r_007b_0028remainder-function_0029_007d-379"></a><a name="index-Remainder-function_002c-_0040code_007b_0025_007d-380"></a>In Lisp, the function for computing a remainder is <code>%</code>.  The
function returns the remainder of its first argument divided by its
second argument.  As it happens, <code>%</code> is a function in Emacs Lisp
that you cannot discover using <code>apropos</code>: you find nothing if you
type <kbd>M-x apropos &lt;RET&gt; remainder &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.  The only way to
learn of the existence of <code>%</code> is to read about it in a book such
as this or in the Emacs Lisp sources.

   </p>
<p>You can try the <code>%</code> function by evaluating the following two
expressions:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (% 7 5)
     
     (% 10 5)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The first expression returns 2 and the second expression returns 0.

   </p>
<p>To test whether the returned value is zero or some other number, we
can use the <code>zerop</code> function.  This function returns <code>t</code> if
its argument, which must be a number, is zero.

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (zerop (% 7 5))
          =&gt; nil
     
     (zerop (% 10 5))
          =&gt; t
</pre>
   <p>Thus, the following expression will return <code>t</code> if the height
of the graph is evenly divisible by five:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (zerop (% height 5))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(The value of <code>height</code>, of course, can be found from <code>(apply
'max numbers-list)</code>.)

   </p>
<p>On the other hand, if the value of <code>height</code> is not a multiple of
five, we want to reset the value to the next higher multiple of five. 
This is straightforward arithmetic using functions with which we are
already familiar.  First, we divide the value of <code>height</code> by five
to determine how many times five goes into the number.  Thus, five
goes into twelve twice.  If we add one to this quotient and multiply by
five, we will obtain the value of the next multiple of five that is
larger than the height.  Five goes into twelve twice.  Add one to two,
and multiply by five; the result is fifteen, which is the next multiple
of five that is higher than twelve.  The Lisp expression for this is:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (* (1+ (/ height 5)) 5)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">For example, if you evaluate the following, the result is 15:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (* (1+ (/ 12 5)) 5)
</pre>
   <p>All through this discussion, we have been using 5 as the value
for spacing labels on the Y axis; but we may want to use some other
value.  For generality, we should replace 5 with a variable to
which we can assign a value.  The best name I can think of for this
variable is <code>Y-axis-label-spacing</code>.

   </p>
<p>Using this term, and an <code>if</code> expression, we produce the
following:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (if (zerop (% height Y-axis-label-spacing))
         height
       ;; <span class="roman">else</span>
       (* (1+ (/ height Y-axis-label-spacing))
          Y-axis-label-spacing))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This expression returns the value of <code>height</code> itself if the height
is an even multiple of the value of the <code>Y-axis-label-spacing</code> or
else it computes and returns a value of <code>height</code> that is equal to
the next higher multiple of the value of the <code>Y-axis-label-spacing</code>.

   </p>
<p>We can now include this expression in the <code>let</code> expression of the
<code>print-graph</code> function (after first setting the value of
<code>Y-axis-label-spacing</code>):
<a name="index-Y_002daxis_002dlabel_002dspacing-381"></a>
</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defvar Y-axis-label-spacing 5
       "Number of lines from one Y axis label to next.")
     
     ...
     (let* ((height (apply 'max numbers-list))
            (height-of-top-line
             (if (zerop (% height Y-axis-label-spacing))
                 height
               ;; <span class="roman">else</span>
               (* (1+ (/ height Y-axis-label-spacing))
                  Y-axis-label-spacing)))
            (symbol-width (length graph-blank))))
     ...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(Note use of the  <code>let*</code> function: the initial value of height is
computed once by the <code>(apply 'max numbers-list)</code> expression and
then the resulting value of  <code>height</code> is used to compute its
final value.  See <a href="#fwd_002dpara-let">The <code>let*</code> expression</a>, for
more about <code>let*</code>.)

<div class="node"><a name="Y-Axis-Element"></a></div>

<h4 class="appendixsubsec">C.2.2 Construct a Y Axis Element</h4>

<p>When we print the vertical axis, we want to insert strings such as
`<samp><span class="samp">5 -</span></samp>'<!-- /@w --> and `<samp><span class="samp">10 - </span></samp>'<!-- /@w --> every five lines. 
Moreover, we want the numbers and dashes to line up, so shorter
numbers must be padded with leading spaces.  If some of the strings
use two digit numbers, the strings with single digit numbers must
include a leading blank space before the number.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-number_002dto_002dstring-382"></a>To figure out the length of the number, the <code>length</code> function is
used.  But the <code>length</code> function works only with a string, not with
a number.  So the number has to be converted from being a number to
being a string.  This is done with the <code>number-to-string</code> function. 
For example,

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (length (number-to-string 35))
          =&gt; 2
     
     (length (number-to-string 100))
          =&gt; 3
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(<code>number-to-string</code> is also called <code>int-to-string</code>; you will
see this alternative name in various sources.)

   </p>
<p>In addition, in each label, each number is followed by a string such
as `<samp><span class="samp"> - </span></samp>'<!-- /@w -->, which we will call the <code>Y-axis-tic</code> marker. 
This variable is defined with <code>defvar</code>:

   </p>
<p><a name="index-Y_002daxis_002dtic-383"></a>
</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defvar Y-axis-tic " - "
        "String that follows number in a Y axis label.")
</pre>
   <p>The length of the Y label is the sum of the length of the Y axis tic
mark and the length of the number of the top of the graph.

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (length (concat (number-to-string height) Y-axis-tic)))
</pre>
   <p>This value will be calculated by the <code>print-graph</code> function in
its varlist as <code>full-Y-label-width</code> and passed on.  (Note that we
did not think to include this in the varlist when we first proposed it.)

   </p>
<p>To make a complete vertical axis label, a tic mark is concatenated
with a number; and the two together may be preceded by one or more
spaces depending on how long the number is.  The label consists of
three parts: the (optional) leading spaces, the number, and the tic
mark.  The function is passed the value of the number for the specific
row, and the value of the width of the top line, which is calculated
(just once) by <code>print-graph</code>.

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun Y-axis-element (number full-Y-label-width)
       "Construct a NUMBERed label element.
     A numbered element looks like this `  5 - ',
     and is padded as needed so all line up with
     the element for the largest number."
       (let* ((leading-spaces
              (- full-Y-label-width
                 (length

         (concat
          (make-string leading-spaces ? )
          (number-to-string number)
          Y-axis-tic)))
</pre>
   <p>The <code>Y-axis-element</code> function concatenates together the leading
spaces, if any; the number, as a string; and the tic mark.

   </p>
<p>To figure out how many leading spaces the label will need, the
function subtracts the actual length of the label—the length of the
number plus the length of the tic mark—from the desired label width.

   </p>
<p><a name="index-make_002dstring-384"></a>Blank spaces are inserted using the <code>make-string</code> function.  This
function takes two arguments: the first tells it how long the string
will be and the second is a symbol for the character to insert, in a
special format.  The format is a question mark followed by a blank
space, like this, `<samp><span class="samp">? </span></samp>'.  See <a href="elisp.html#Character-Type">Character Type</a>, for a description of the
syntax for characters.  (Of course, you might want to replace the
blank space by some other character <small class="dots">...</small>  You know what to do.)

   </p>
<p>The <code>number-to-string</code> function is used in the concatenation
expression, to convert the number to a string that is concatenated

   <p>In this function, we start with the value of <code>height</code> and
repetitively subtract one from its value.  After each subtraction, we
test to see whether the value is an integral multiple of the

using the <code>Y-axis-element</code> function; if not, we construct a

<code>print-X-axis</code> function.

   </p>
<p>This is a three step process:

     </p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Write a function to print the X axis tic marks, <code>print-X-axis-tic-line</code>.

     </li>
<li>Write a function to print the X numbers, <code>print-X-axis-numbered-line</code>.

     </li>
<li>Write a function to print both lines, the <code>print-X-axis</code> function,
using <code>print-X-axis-tic-line</code> and
<code>print-X-axis-numbered-line</code>.
        </li>
</ol>

<div class="node"><a name="X-Axis-Tic-Marks"></a></div>

<h4 class="appendixsubsec">C.3.1 X Axis Tic Marks</h4>

<p>The first function should print the X axis tic marks.  We must specify
the tic marks themselves and their spacing:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defvar X-axis-label-spacing
       (if (boundp 'graph-blank)
           (* 5 (length graph-blank)) 5)
       "Number of units from one X axis label to next.")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(Note that the value of <code>graph-blank</code> is set by another
<code>defvar</code>.  The <code>boundp</code> predicate checks whether it has
already been set; <code>boundp</code> returns <code>nil</code> if it has not.  If
<code>graph-blank</code> were unbound and we did not use this conditional
construction, in a recent GNU Emacs, we would enter the debugger and
see an error message saying `<samp><span class="samp">Debugger entered--Lisp error:<!-- /@w -->
(void-variable graph-blank)<!-- /@w --></span></samp>'.)

   </p>
<p>Here is the <code>defvar</code> for <code>X-axis-tic-symbol</code>:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defvar X-axis-tic-symbol "|"
       "String to insert to point to a column in X axis.")
</pre>
   <p>The goal is to make a line that looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">            |   |    |    |
</pre>
   <p>The first tic is indented so that it is under the first column, which is
indented to provide space for the Y axis labels.

   </p>
<p>A tic element consists of the blank spaces that stretch from one tic to
the next plus a tic symbol.  The number of blanks is determined by the
width of the tic symbol and the <code>X-axis-label-spacing</code>.

   </p>
<p>The code looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ;;; X-axis-tic-element
     ...
     (concat
      (make-string
       ;; <span class="roman">Make a string of blanks.</span>
       (-  (* symbol-width X-axis-label-spacing)
           (length X-axis-tic-symbol))
       ? )
      ;; <span class="roman">Concatenate blanks with tic symbol.</span>
      X-axis-tic-symbol)
     ...
</pre>
   <p>Next, we determine how many blanks are needed to indent the first tic
mark to the first column of the graph.  This uses the value of
<code>full-Y-label-width</code> passed it by the <code>print-graph</code> function.

   </p>
<p>The code to make <code>X-axis-leading-spaces</code>
looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ;; X-axis-leading-spaces
     ...
     (make-string full-Y-label-width ? )
     ...
</pre>
   <p>We also need to determine the length of the horizontal axis, which is
the length of the numbers list, and the number of ticks in the horizontal
axis:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ;; X-length
     ...
     (length numbers-list)
     
     ;; tic-width
     ...
     (* symbol-width X-axis-label-spacing)
     
     ;; number-of-X-ticks
     (if (zerop (% (X-length tic-width)))
         (/ (X-length tic-width))
       (1+ (/ (X-length tic-width))))
</pre>
   <p>All this leads us directly to the function for printing the X axis tic line:

   </p>
<p><a name="index-print_002dX_002daxis_002dtic_002dline-391"></a>
</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun print-X-axis-tic-line
       (number-of-X-tics X-axis-leading-spaces X-axis-tic-element)
       "Print ticks for X axis."
         (insert X-axis-leading-spaces)
         (insert X-axis-tic-symbol)  ; <span class="roman">Under first column.</span>
         ;; <span class="roman">Insert second tic in the right spot.</span>
         (insert (concat
                  (make-string
                   (-  (* symbol-width X-axis-label-spacing)
                       ;; <span class="roman">Insert white space up to second tic symbol.</span>
                       (* 2 (length X-axis-tic-symbol)))
                   ? )
                  X-axis-tic-symbol))
         ;; <span class="roman">Insert remaining ticks.</span>
         (while (&gt; number-of-X-tics 1)
           (insert X-axis-tic-element)
           (setq number-of-X-tics (1- number-of-X-tics))))
</pre>
   <p>The line of numbers is equally straightforward:

   </p>
<p>First, we create a numbered element with blank spaces before each number:

   </p>
<p><a name="index-X_002daxis_002delement-392"></a>
</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun X-axis-element (number)
       "Construct a numbered X axis element."
       (let ((leading-spaces
              (-  (* symbol-width X-axis-label-spacing)
                  (length (number-to-string number)))))
         (concat (make-string leading-spaces ? )
                 (number-to-string number))))
</pre>
   <p>Next, we create the function to print the numbered line, starting with
the number 1 under the first column:

   </p>
<p><a name="index-print_002dX_002daxis_002dnumbered_002dline-393"></a>
</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun print-X-axis-numbered-line
       (number-of-X-tics X-axis-leading-spaces)
       "Print line of X-axis numbers"
       (let ((number X-axis-label-spacing))
         (insert X-axis-leading-spaces)
         (insert "1")
         (insert (concat
                  (make-string
                   ;; <span class="roman">Insert white space up to next number.</span>
                   (-  (* symbol-width X-axis-label-spacing) 2)
                   ? )
                  (number-to-string number)))
         ;; <span class="roman">Insert remaining numbers.</span>
         (setq number (+ number X-axis-label-spacing))
         (while (&gt; number-of-X-tics 1)
           (insert (X-axis-element number))
           (setq number (+ number X-axis-label-spacing))
           (setq number-of-X-tics (1- number-of-X-tics)))))
</pre>
   <p>Finally, we need to write the <code>print-X-axis</code> that uses
<code>print-X-axis-tic-line</code> and
<code>print-X-axis-numbered-line</code>.

   </p>
<p>The function must determine the local values of the variables used by both
<code>print-X-axis-tic-line</code> and <code>print-X-axis-numbered-line</code>, and
then it must call them.  Also, it must print the carriage return that
separates the two lines.

   </p>
<p>The function consists of a varlist that specifies five local variables,
and calls to each of the two line printing functions:

   </p>
<p><a name="index-print_002dX_002daxis-394"></a>
</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun print-X-axis (numbers-list)
       "Print X axis labels to length of NUMBERS-LIST."
       (let* ((leading-spaces
               (make-string full-Y-label-width ? ))
            ;; symbol-width <span class="roman">is provided by</span> graph-body-print
            (tic-width (* symbol-width X-axis-label-spacing))
            (X-length (length numbers-list))
            (X-tic
             (concat
              (make-string
               ;; <span class="roman">Make a string of blanks.</span>
               (-  (* symbol-width X-axis-label-spacing)
                   (length X-axis-tic-symbol))
               ? )
              ;; <span class="roman">Concatenate blanks with tic symbol.</span>
              X-axis-tic-symbol))
            (tic-number
             (if (zerop (% X-length tic-width))
                 (/ X-length tic-width)
               (1+ (/ X-length tic-width)))))
         (print-X-axis-tic-line tic-number leading-spaces X-tic)
         (insert "\n")
         (print-X-axis-numbered-line tic-number leading-spaces)))
</pre>
   <p>You can test <code>print-X-axis</code>:

     </p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Install <code>X-axis-tic-symbol</code>, <code>X-axis-label-spacing</code>,
<code>print-X-axis-tic-line</code>, as well as <code>X-axis-element</code>,
<code>print-X-axis-numbered-line</code>, and <code>print-X-axis</code>.

     </li>
<li>Copy the following expression:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (progn
           (let ((full-Y-label-width 5)
                 (symbol-width 1))
             (print-X-axis
              '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16))))
     </pre>
     </li>
<li>Switch to the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer and place the cursor where you
want the axis labels to start.

     </li>
<li>Type <kbd>M-:</kbd> (<code>eval-expression</code>).

     </li>
<li>Yank the test expression into the minibuffer
with <kbd>C-y</kbd> (<code>yank)</code>.

     </li>
<li>Press &lt;RET&gt; to evaluate the expression.
        </li>
</ol>

   <p>Emacs will print the horizontal axis like this:
   </p>
<pre class="sp">

</pre>
<pre class="smallexample">          |   |    |    |    |

Now we are nearly ready to print the whole graph.

<p>The function to print the graph with the proper labels follows the

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Changes for the Final Version</h4>

   <p>The final version is different from what we planned in two ways:
first, it contains additional values calculated once in the varlist;
second, it carries an option to specify the labels' increment per row. 
This latter feature turns out to be essential; otherwise, a graph may
have more rows than fit on a display or on a sheet of paper.

   </p>
<p>This new feature requires a change to the <code>Y-axis-column</code>
function, to add <code>vertical-step</code> to it.  The function looks like
this:

   </p>
<p><a name="index-Y_002daxis_002dcolumn-_0040r_007bFinal-version_002e_007d-398"></a>
</p>

       "Construct list of labels for Y axis.

     WIDTH-OF-LABEL is maximum width of label.
     VERTICAL-STEP, an option, is a positive integer
     that specifies how much a Y axis label increments
     for each line.  For example, a step of 5 means
     that each line is five units of the graph."
       (let (Y-axis
             (number-per-line (or vertical-step 1)))
         (while (&gt; height 1)
           (if (zerop (% height Y-axis-label-spacing))
               ;; <span class="roman">Insert label.</span>

                    Y-axis)))
           (setq height (1- height)))
         ;; <span class="roman">Insert base line.</span>

         (nreverse Y-axis)))
</pre>
   <p>The values for the maximum height of graph and the width of a symbol
are computed by <code>print-graph</code> in its <code>let</code> expression; so
<code>graph-body-print</code> must be changed to accept them.

   </p>

</pre>
   <p>Finally, the code for the <code>print-graph</code> function:

   </p>

<p>Now for the graph for which all this code was written: a graph that
shows how many function definitions contain fewer than 10 words and
symbols, how many contain between 10 and 19 words and symbols, how
many contain between 20 and 29 words and symbols, and so on.

   </p>
<p>This is a multi-step process.  First make sure you have loaded all the
requisite code.

   </p>
<p>It is a good idea to reset the value of <code>top-of-ranges</code> in case
you have set it to some different value.  You can evaluate the
following:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setq top-of-ranges
      '(10  20  30  40  50
        60  70  80  90 100
       110 120 130 140 150
       160 170 180 190 200
       210 220 230 240 250
       260 270 280 290 300)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Next create a list of the number of words and symbols in each range.

</p>
<p class="noindent">Evaluate the following:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setq list-for-graph
            (defuns-per-range
              (sort
               (recursive-lengths-list-many-files
                (directory-files "/usr/local/emacs/lisp"
                                 t ".+el$"))
               '&lt;)
              top-of-ranges))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">On my old machine, this took about an hour.  It looked though 303 Lisp
files in my copy of Emacs version 19.23.  After all that computing,
the <code>list-for-graph</code> had this value:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (537 1027 955 785 594 483 349 292 224 199 166 120 116 99
     90 80 67 48 52 45 41 33 28 26 25 20 12 28 11 13 220)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This means that my copy of Emacs had 537 function definitions with
fewer than 10 words or symbols in them, 1,027 function definitions
with 10 to 19 words or symbols in them, 955 function definitions with
20 to 29 words or symbols in them, and so on.

   </p>
<p>Clearly, just by looking at this list we can see that most function
definitions contain ten to thirty words and symbols.

   </p>
<p>Now for printing.  We do <em>not</em> want to print a graph that is
1,030 lines high <small class="dots">...</small>  Instead, we should print a graph that is
fewer than twenty-five lines high.  A graph that height can be
displayed on almost any monitor, and easily printed on a sheet of paper.

   </p>
<p>This means that each value in <code>list-for-graph</code> must be reduced to
one-fiftieth its present value.

   </p>
<p>Here is a short function to do just that, using two functions we have
not yet seen, <code>mapcar</code> and <code>lambda</code>.

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun one-fiftieth (full-range)
       "Return list, each number one-fiftieth of previous."
      (mapcar (lambda (arg) (/ arg 50)) full-range))
</pre>
   <div class="node"><a name="lambda"></a></div>

<h4 class="appendixsubsec">C.4.3 A <code>lambda</code> Expression: Useful Anonymity</h4>

<p><a name="index-Anonymous-function-401"></a><a name="index-lambda-402"></a>
<code>lambda</code> is the symbol for an anonymous function, a function
without a name.  Every time you use an anonymous function, you need to
include its whole body.

</p>
<p class="noindent">Thus,

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (lambda (arg) (/ arg 50))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">is a function that returns the value resulting from
dividing whatever is passed to it as <code>arg</code> by 50.

   </p>
<p>Earlier, for example, we had a function <code>multiply-by-seven</code>; it
multiplied its argument by 7.  This function is similar, except it
divides its argument by 50; and, it has no name.  The anonymous
equivalent of <code>multiply-by-seven</code> is:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (lambda (number) (* 7 number))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(See <a href="#defun">The <code>defun</code> Macro</a>.)

</p>
<p class="noindent">If we want to multiply 3 by 7, we can write:

<!-- clear print-postscript-figures -->
<!-- lambda example diagram #1 -->
</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (multiply-by-seven 3)
      \_______________/ ^
              |         |
           function  argument
</pre>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

This expression returns 21.

<p class="noindent">Similarly, we can write:

<!-- lambda example diagram #2 -->
</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     ((lambda (number) (* 7 number)) 3)
      \____________________________/ ^
                    |                |
           anonymous function     argument
</pre>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

If we want to divide 100 by 50, we can write:

<!-- lambda example diagram #3 -->
<pre class="smallexample">     ((lambda (arg) (/ arg 50)) 100)
      \______________________/  \_/
                  |              |
         anonymous function   argument
</pre>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

This expression returns 2.  The 100 is passed to the function, which
divides that number by 50.

   <p>See <a href="elisp.html#Lambda-Expressions">Lambda Expressions</a>, for more about <code>lambda</code>.  Lisp and lambda
expressions derive from the Lambda Calculus.

<div class="node"><a name="mapcar"></a></div>

<h4 class="appendixsubsec">C.4.4 The <code>mapcar</code> Function</h4>

<p><a name="index-mapcar-403"></a>
<code>mapcar</code> is a function that calls its first argument with each
element of its second argument, in turn.  The second argument must be
a sequence.

   </p>
<p>The `<samp><span class="samp">map</span></samp>' part of the name comes from the mathematical phrase,
“mapping over a domain”, meaning to apply a function to each of the
elements in a domain.  The mathematical phrase is based on the
metaphor of a surveyor walking, one step at a time, over an area he is
mapping.  And `<samp><span class="samp">car</span></samp>', of course, comes from the Lisp notion of the
first of a list.

</p>
<p class="noindent">For example,

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (mapcar '1+ '(2 4 6))
          =&gt; (3 5 7)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The function <code>1+</code> which adds one to its argument, is executed on
<em>each</em> element of the list, and a new list is returned.

   </p>
<p>Contrast this with <code>apply</code>, which applies its first argument to
all the remaining. 
(See <a href="#Readying-a-Graph">Readying a Graph</a>, for a explanation of
<code>apply</code>.)

   </p>
<p>In the definition of <code>one-fiftieth</code>, the first argument is the
anonymous function:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (lambda (arg) (/ arg 50))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and the second argument is <code>full-range</code>, which will be bound to
<code>list-for-graph</code>.

   </p>
<p>The whole expression looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (mapcar (lambda (arg) (/ arg 50)) full-range))
</pre>
   <p>See <a href="elisp.html#Mapping-Functions">Mapping Functions</a>, for more about <code>mapcar</code>.

   </p>
<p>Using the <code>one-fiftieth</code> function, we can generate a list in
which each element is one-fiftieth the size of the corresponding
element in <code>list-for-graph</code>.

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (setq fiftieth-list-for-graph
           (one-fiftieth list-for-graph))
</pre>
   <p>The resulting list looks like this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (10 20 19 15 11 9 6 5 4 3 3 2 2
     1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This, we are almost ready to print!  (We also notice the loss of
information: many of the higher ranges are 0, meaning that fewer than
50 defuns had that many words or symbols—but not necessarily meaning
that none had that many words or symbols.)

<div class="node"><a name="Another-Bug"></a></div>

<h4 class="appendixsubsec">C.4.5 Another Bug <small class="dots">...</small> Most Insidious</h4>

<p><a name="index-Bug_002c-most-insidious-type-404"></a><a name="index-Insidious-type-of-bug-405"></a>
I said “almost ready to print”!  Of course, there is a bug in the
<code>print-graph</code> function <small class="dots">...</small>  It has a <code>vertical-step</code>
option, but not a <code>horizontal-step</code> option.  The
<code>top-of-range</code> scale goes from 10 to 300 by tens.  But the
<code>print-graph</code> function will print only by ones.

   </p>
<p>This is a classic example of what some consider the most insidious
type of bug, the bug of omission.  This is not the kind of bug you can
find by studying the code, for it is not in the code; it is an omitted
feature.  Your best actions are to try your program early and often;
and try to arrange, as much as you can, to write code that is easy to
understand and easy to change.  Try to be aware, whenever you can,
that whatever you have written, <em>will</em> be rewritten, if not soon,
eventually.  A hard maxim to follow.

   </p>
<p>It is the <code>print-X-axis-numbered-line</code> function that needs the
work; and then the <code>print-X-axis</code> and the <code>print-graph</code>
functions need to be adapted.  Not much needs to be done; there is one
nicety: the numbers ought to line up under the tic marks.  This takes
a little thought.

   </p>
<p>Here is the corrected <code>print-X-axis-numbered-line</code>:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (defun print-X-axis-numbered-line
       (number-of-X-tics X-axis-leading-spaces
        &amp;optional horizontal-step)

       (let ((number X-axis-label-spacing)

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix D Free Software and Free Manuals</h2>

<p><strong>by Richard M. Stallman</strong>
   </p>
<pre class="sp">

</pre>

The biggest deficiency in free operating systems is not in the
software—it is the lack of good free manuals that we can include in
these systems.  Many of our most important programs do not come with
full manuals.  Documentation is an essential part of any software
package; when an important free software package does not come with a
free manual, that is a major gap.  We have many such gaps today.

   <p>Once upon a time, many years ago, I thought I would learn Perl.  I got
a copy of a free manual, but I found it hard to read.  When I asked
Perl users about alternatives, they told me that there were better
introductory manuals—but those were not free.

   </p>
<p>Why was this?  The authors of the good manuals had written them for
O'Reilly Associates, which published them with restrictive terms—no
copying, no modification, source files not available—which exclude
them from the free software community.

   </p>
<p>That wasn't the first time this sort of thing has happened, and (to
our community's great loss) it was far from the last.  Proprietary
manual publishers have enticed a great many authors to restrict their
manuals since then.  Many times I have heard a GNU user eagerly tell me
about a manual that he is writing, with which he expects to help the
GNU project—and then had my hopes dashed, as he proceeded to explain
that he had signed a contract with a publisher that would restrict it
so that we cannot use it.

   </p>
<p>Given that writing good English is a rare skill among programmers, we
can ill afford to lose manuals this way.

   </p>
<p>Free documentation, like free software, is a matter of freedom, not
price.  The problem with these manuals was not that O'Reilly Associates
charged a price for printed copies—that in itself is fine.  The Free
Software Foundation <a href="http://shop.fsf.org">sells printed copies</a> of
free <a href="http://www.gnu.org/doc/doc.html">GNU manuals</a>, too. 
But GNU manuals are available in source code form, while these manuals
are available only on paper.  GNU manuals come with permission to copy
and modify; the Perl manuals do not.  These restrictions are the
problems.

   </p>
<p>The criterion for a free manual is pretty much the same as for free
software: it is a matter of giving all users certain
freedoms.  Redistribution (including commercial redistribution) must be
permitted, so that the manual can accompany every copy of the program,
on-line or on paper.  Permission for modification is crucial too.

   </p>
<p>As a general rule, I don't believe that it is essential for people to
have permission to modify all sorts of articles and books.  The issues
for writings are not necessarily the same as those for software.  For
example, I don't think you or I are obliged to give permission to
modify articles like this one, which describe our actions and our
views.

   </p>
<p>But there is a particular reason why the freedom to modify is crucial
for documentation for free software.  When people exercise their right
to modify the software, and add or change its features, if they are
conscientious they will change the manual too—so they can provide
accurate and usable documentation with the modified program.  A manual
which forbids programmers to be conscientious and finish the job, or
more precisely requires them to write a new manual from scratch if
they change the program, does not fill our community's needs.

   </p>
<p>While a blanket prohibition on modification is unacceptable, some
kinds of limits on the method of modification pose no problem.  For
example, requirements to preserve the original author's copyright
notice, the distribution terms, or the list of authors, are ok.  It is
also no problem to require modified versions to include notice that
they were modified, even to have entire sections that may not be
deleted or changed, as long as these sections deal with nontechnical
topics.  (Some GNU manuals have them.)

   </p>
<p>These kinds of restrictions are not a problem because, as a practical
matter, they don't stop the conscientious programmer from adapting the
manual to fit the modified program.  In other words, they don't block
the free software community from making full use of the manual.

   </p>
<p>However, it must be possible to modify all the technical content of
the manual, and then distribute the result in all the usual media,
through all the usual channels; otherwise, the restrictions do block
the community, the manual is not free, and so we need another manual.

   </p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is often hard to find someone to write another
manual when a proprietary manual exists.  The obstacle is that many
users think that a proprietary manual is good enough—so they don't
see the need to write a free manual.  They do not see that the free
operating system has a gap that needs filling.

   </p>
<p>Why do users think that proprietary manuals are good enough?  Some have
not considered the issue.  I hope this article will do something to
change that.

   </p>
<p>Other users consider proprietary manuals acceptable for the same
reason so many people consider proprietary software acceptable: they
judge in purely practical terms, not using freedom as a
criterion.  These people are entitled to their opinions, but since
those opinions spring from values which do not include freedom, they
are no guide for those of us who do value freedom.

   </p>
<p>Please spread the word about this issue.  We continue to lose manuals
to proprietary publishing.  If we spread the word that proprietary
manuals are not sufficient, perhaps the next person who wants to help
GNU by writing documentation will realize, before it is too late, that
he must above all make it free.

   </p>
<p>We can also encourage commercial publishers to sell free, copylefted
manuals instead of proprietary ones.  One way you can help this is to
check the distribution terms of a manual before you buy it, and prefer
copylefted manuals to non-copylefted ones.

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

     <ol type="1" start="0">
<li>PREAMBLE

     <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <dfn>free</dfn> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. 
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

     </p>
<p>This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

     </p>
<p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

     </p>
</li>
<li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     <p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The “Document”, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as “you”.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

     </p>
<p>A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

     </p>
<p>A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

     </p>
<p>The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

     </p>
<p>The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

     </p>
<p>A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. 
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

     </p>
<p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, SGML or XML using a publicly available
DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and
JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

     </p>
<p>The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title Page” means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     </p>
<p>The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.

     </p>
<p>A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as “Acknowledgements”,
“Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)  To “Preserve the Title”
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section “Entitled XYZ” according to this definition.

     </p>
<p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

     </p>
</li>
<li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     </p>
<p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     </p>
</li>
<li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     </p>
<p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     </p>
<p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. 
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

     </p>
<p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     </p>
</li>
<li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

          </p>
<ol type="A" start="1">
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

          </li>
<li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

          </li>
<li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

          </li>
<li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

          </li>
<li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

          </li>
<li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

          </li>
<li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

          </li>
<li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

          </li>
<li>Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled “History” in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

          </li>
<li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the “History” section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

          </li>
<li>For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

          </li>
<li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

          </li>
<li>Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

          </li>
<li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled “Endorsements” or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

          </li>
<li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          </li>
</ol>

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     </p>
<p>You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     </p>
<p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     </p>
<p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     </p>
</li>
<li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

     </p>
<p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     </p>
<p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled “History”
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
“History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You must delete all
sections Entitled “Endorsements.”

     </p>
</li>
<li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     </p>
<p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     </p>
</li>
<li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. 
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

     </p>
<p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. 
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

     </p>
</li>
<li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     </p>
<p>If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
“Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

     </p>
</li>
<li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     </p>
<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

     </p>
<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

     </p>
<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

     </p>
</li>
<li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

     </p>
<p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

     </p>
</li>
<li>RELICENSING

     <p>“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.

     </p>
<p>“CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

     </p>
<p>“Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.

     </p>
<p>An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

     </p>
<p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

        </p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="heading">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">       Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the “with<small class="dots">...</small>Texts.” line with this:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">         with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being <var>list</var>.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   </p>
<p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.

<div class="footnote">
<hr>
<a name="texinfo-footnotes-in-document"></a><h4>Footnotes</h4>
<p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> A single-quote is an
abbreviation for the special form <code>quote</code>; you need not think
about special forms now.  See <a href="#Complications">Complications</a>.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-2" href="#fnd-2">2</a>]</small> It is curious to track the path by which the word “argument”
came to have two different meanings, one in mathematics and the other in
everyday English.  According to the <cite>Oxford English Dictionary</cite>,
the word derives from the Latin for `<samp><span class="samp">to make clear, prove</span></samp>'; thus it
came to mean, by one thread of derivation, “the evidence offered as
proof”, which is to say, “the information offered”, which led to its
meaning in Lisp.  But in the other thread of derivation, it came to mean
“to assert in a manner against which others may make counter
assertions”, which led to the meaning of the word as a disputation. 
(Note here that the English word has two different definitions attached
to it at the same time.  By contrast, in Emacs Lisp, a symbol cannot
have two different function definitions at the same time.)</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-3" href="#fnd-3">3</a>]</small> <code>(quote hello)</code> is an expansion of
the abbreviation <code>'hello</code>.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-4" href="#fnd-4">4</a>]</small> Actually, you
can use <code>%s</code> to print a number.  It is non-specific.  <code>%d</code>
prints only the part of a number left of a decimal point, and not
anything that is not a number.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-5" href="#fnd-5">5</a>]</small> Actually, by default, if the buffer from which you
just switched is visible to you in another window, <code>other-buffer</code>
will choose the most recent buffer that you cannot see; this is a
subtlety that I often forget.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-6" href="#fnd-6">6</a>]</small> Or
rather, to save typing, you probably only typed <kbd>RET</kbd> if the
default buffer was <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp>, or if it was different, then you
typed just part of the name, such as <code>*sc</code>, pressed your
<kbd>TAB</kbd> key to cause it to expand to the full name, and then typed
<kbd>RET</kbd>.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-7" href="#fnd-7">7</a>]</small> Remember, this
expression will move you to your most recent other buffer that you
cannot see.  If you really want to go to your most recently selected
buffer, even if you can still see it, you need to evaluate the
following more complex expression:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     (switch-to-buffer (other-buffer (current-buffer) t))
</pre>
   <!-- noindent -->
<p>In this case, the first argument to <code>other-buffer</code> tells it which
buffer to skip—the current one—and the second argument tells
<code>other-buffer</code> it is OK to switch to a visible buffer.  In
regular use, <code>switch-to-buffer</code> takes you to a buffer not visible
in windows since you would most likely use <kbd>C-x o</kbd>
(<code>other-window</code>) to go to another visible buffer.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-8" href="#fnd-8">8</a>]</small> According
to Jared Diamond in <cite>Guns, Germs, and Steel</cite>, “<small class="dots">...</small> zebras
become impossibly dangerous as they grow older” but the claim here is
that they do not become fierce like a tiger.  (1997, W. W. Norton and
Co., ISBN 0-393-03894-2, page 171)</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-9" href="#fnd-9">9</a>]</small> Actually, you can
<code>cons</code> an element to an atom to produce a dotted pair.  Dotted
pairs are not discussed here; see <a href="elisp.html#Dotted-Pair-Notation">Dotted Pair Notation</a>.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-10" href="#fnd-10">10</a>]</small> More precisely, and requiring more expert knowledge
to understand, the two integers are of type <code>Lisp_Object</code>, which can
also be a C union instead of an integer type.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-11" href="#fnd-11">11</a>]</small> You can write
recursive functions to be frugal or wasteful of mental or computer
resources; as it happens, methods that people find easy—that are
frugal of mental resources—sometimes use considerable computer
resources.  Emacs was designed to run on machines that we now consider
limited and its default settings are conservative.  You may want to
increase the values of <code>max-specpdl-size</code> and
<code>max-lisp-eval-depth</code>.  In my <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file, I set them to
15 and 30 times their default value.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-12" href="#fnd-12">12</a>]</small> The phrase <dfn>tail
recursive</dfn> is used to describe such a process, one that uses
constant space.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-13" href="#fnd-13">13</a>]</small> The
jargon is mildly confusing:  <code>triangle-recursive-helper</code> uses a
process that is iterative in a procedure that is recursive.  The
process is called iterative because the computer need only record the
three values, <code>sum</code>, <code>counter</code>, and <code>number</code>; the
procedure is recursive because the function calls itself.  On the
other hand, both the process and the procedure used by
<code>triangle-recursively</code> are called recursive.  The word
“recursive” has different meanings in the two contexts.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-14" href="#fnd-14">14</a>]</small> You
may also add <samp><span class="file">.el</span></samp> to <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> and call it a
<samp><span class="file">~/.emacs.el</span></samp> file.  In the past, you were forbidden to type the
extra keystrokes that the name <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs.el</span></samp> requires, but now
you may.  The new format is consistent with the Emacs Lisp file
naming conventions; the old format saves typing.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-15" href="#fnd-15">15</a>]</small> When I start instances of Emacs that do not load my
<samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file or any site file, I also turn off blinking:

</p>
<pre class="smallexample">     emacs -q --no-site-file -eval '(blink-cursor-mode nil)'
     
<br>Or nowadays, using an even more sophisticated set of options,<br>
     
     emacs -Q -D
</pre>
   <p></p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-16" href="#fnd-16">16</a>]</small> I also
run more modern window managers, such as Enlightenment, Gnome, or KDE;
in those cases, I often specify an image rather than a plain color.</p>
